"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll consider it as 3 muffins).

Now, she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left. She sells these 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

So, Janet makes 10 * $2 = $20 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance covered in a week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given to her chickens so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

Total feed available = 3 * 20 chickens * 3 meals
Total feed available = 180 cups

Now, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

Feed left for the final meal = Total feed available - Total feed given so far
Feed left for the final meal = 180 cups - 800 cups
Feed left for the final meal = -620 cups

Since we cannot have a negative amount of feed, this means that Wendi has given her chickens more feed than she has available."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download again:
Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Total distance covered = 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is 315 - 180 = 135 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the tree needs to break even (i.e., the net profit should be $0), we can set up an equation:

$7.5 (net profit) = $0

However, this equation doesn't make sense in this context, as it implies the tree will never break even. We need to consider the initial cost of the tree.

Let's recalculate the break-even point:

Initial cost: $90
Annual net profit: $7.5

To find the break-even point, we can divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (annual net profit) = 12 years

This means it will take 12 years for the tree to break even. However, this doesn't mean Carlos will start earning money immediately after 12 years. He will start earning money in the 13th year.

So, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for both options.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Potential value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Potential value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is greater than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by both trains: 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we add the distances covered by both trains: 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance covered by each train: 160 + 300 = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $20/hour = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $30/hour = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in 1 week (7 days) she will make 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

In 4 weeks, she will make 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance covered so far. Marissa has covered 4 miles and 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know that Marissa has already spent 1 hour and 1 hour, so the remaining time is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance. 

Required speed = Total distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we have 24 liters of the combined drinks, so we need to find the amount of water in 24 liters of the combined drink. The combined drink is 2/3 orange + 3/5 pineapple = (10/15 + 9/15) = 19/15 water. 

To find the amount of water in 24 liters of the combined drink, we multiply 24 by 19/15: 24 * 19/15 = 456/15 = 30.4 liters.

Now, we subtract the amount of water in the spilled orange drink (1 liter) from the total amount of water in the combined drink: 30.4 - 1 = 29.4 liters.

The final answer is 29.4."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows: 
31 - 6 = 25

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son is 2 years younger than Raymond. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 2 = 23

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). We know he paid $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes in that time period and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The remaining distance after his first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance he traveled after his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled after the second stop from the remaining distance after the first stop: 40 - 45 = -5 miles. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance between his first and second stops is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's current age:

Darrell's current age = 7x = 7(9) = 63

And Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add up the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money John has:
$195 - $160 = $35

John has $35 left. Since he started with $195, we can subtract the amount he has left from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on the video games:
$195 - $35 = $160

Now, we know that John spent $160 on the video games. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we can divide the amount he spent on the video games by the price of each Lego set:
$160 / $15 per set = 10.67 sets

Since John can't sell a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that he has $5 left, which means he didn't sell all his sets. 

Let's recalculate the number of sets he sold:
$195 - $160 = $35, and he has $5 left, so he must have sold 10 sets.

Now, we know he sold 10 sets. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets:
13 - 10 = 3

John still has 3 Lego sets."

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, his average speed is:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 6 miles / 3 hours
= 2 miles per hour

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. 

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Number of candles made = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost per candle = $10.00 (1 pound of beeswax and the wick)
Number of candles made = 20
Total cost = Cost per candle * Number of candles
Total cost = $10.00 * 20
Total cost = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The negative sign indicates that Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used at work and the ones she had remaining: 220 (used at work) + 23 (remaining) = 243.

Therefore, the package she purchased must have contained 243 - 80 = 163 Post-it notes.

163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Total number of floors = 15
Number of occupied floors = 3/4 * 15 = 11.25 (round down to 11, since we can't have a fraction of a floor)

Each floor has 8 units, so the total number of occupied units is:
11 floors * 8 units/floor = 88 units

Since the total number of units in the building is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

The total number of unoccupied units is:
120 units - 88 units = 32 units

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount more that the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, her annual pension increases by 5% each year. 

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $58,131.25
Year 24: $58,131.25 * 1.05 = $61,240.81
Year 25: $61,240.81 * 1.05 = $64,453.08
Year 26: $64,453.08 * 1.05 = $67,700.34
Year 27: $67,700.34 * 1.05 = $71,095.36
Year 28: $71,095.36 * 1.05 = $74,550.38

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = 840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.
10% of 140 is 0.1 * 140 = 14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = 126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = 756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount she paid for the year:
840 + 756 = 1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Now, we can divide the amount of gas left in the tank by the distance Sophia has already traveled (100 miles) to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank.

8 gallons (gas left) / 100 miles (distance traveled) = 0.08 miles per gallon

To find the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

0.08 miles per gallon * 12 gallons (total capacity) = 0.96 miles

So, Sophia can drive approximately 0.96 miles per gallon, but since we can't drive a fraction of a mile, we can round down to 0.96 miles per gallon.

However, to find the total distance she can drive on a single tank, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank and then add the distance she has already traveled.

0.96 miles per gallon * 12 gallons (total capacity) = 11.52 miles

11.52 miles + 100 miles (distance traveled) = 111.52 miles

So, Sophia can drive approximately 111.52 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After 180 days, she will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 to find out how many bags Cecilia will use in the first year.

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry = 400 pounds
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can calculate Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds. 

4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, let's add their weights together: 
Grace's weight: 125 pounds
Alex's weight: 498 pounds
Combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of blocks from each year of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene started at 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been on vacations for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year is 4. 

The total number of blocks is the number of years multiplied by the number of blocks per year, which is 11 * 4 = 44.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, she will need 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags.

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can represent Gerald's time as x. Then, Lee's time would be x - 2.

We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 38.

Solving for x, we get x = 40.

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his improved time. Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, we can multiply his original time by 1.1 (which is equivalent to a 10% increase).

Gerald's improved time = 40 * 1.1 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 
9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 3 to find the number of tomatoes. 

16 ounces / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the ones that took an exit. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took an exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took an exit
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will remain with, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for all friends: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched TV.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Total roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can find the average by adding their roll-ups and dividing by 2.

Average roll-ups: (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

First, we know that Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the rate at which she rowed, we can divide the distance by the time:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rate = 1.25 feet per second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of water taken on:

Let x be the total amount of water taken on. We know that for every 10 feet, 2 liters are taken on. So, for every 1.25 feet (the rate at which Julia rowed), we can find the amount of water taken on:

2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 1.25 feet
x = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 1.25 feet
x = 0.25 liters per foot

Now, we can multiply this rate by the total distance Julia rowed to find the total amount of water taken on:

Total water taken on = Rate * Total distance
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/foot * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can write another equation:
B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has gone up by 50%, the new price is 1.5 times the original price. 
New price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * 1.5 * $10 = $150.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.

Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters Jennie put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = 30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, Jennie had 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when she began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are given that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them have.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Total hours spent on patients per day = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients per day - Total cost of doctors' time per day
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000
Profit per day = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

For the second test, we do the same: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, the total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105.

= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700. Since the total number of bees is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees, we can write the equation:
Q + B + W = 700

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars. 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 45 bees had returned before this, so 60 - 45 = 15 bees from the second wave of bees leave without returning.

The remaining bees from the second wave that leave in the next 6 hours are 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours, we need to add the 30 bees that initially left to the 45 bees that left in the second wave. 

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 (initially left) + 45 (remaining from the second wave) = 75 bees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since we can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll correct this by assuming the pigeons ate 3 fries less than the remaining fries, so they ate 7 - 3 = 4 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 7 = 14/3 = 4.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 4 fries.
7. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 7 - 4 = 3 fries.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
180 yards * 34 rounds = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, let's calculate the price after 2 months: 
Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Next, we'll calculate the price after 4 months: 
Original price = $24
Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see a pattern here. The increase is doubling every two months. 
So, we can calculate the price after 6 months: 
Original price = $28.80
Increase = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the price after 8 months: 
Original price = $34.56
Increase = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

Now, we can calculate the price after 10 months: 
Original price = $41.472
Increase = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
Price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

We can see that the price is increasing by a factor of 1.2 every two months. 
So, we can calculate the price after 36 months: 
Original price = $49.7664
Increase = 20% of $49.7664 = 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328
Price after 12 months = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968
Increase = 20% of $59.71968 = 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936
Price after 14 months = $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616
Increase = 20% of $71.663616 = 0.20 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232
Price after 16 months = $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. 

The total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of the doll is $15.

Now, we add the costs of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = €1403

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1403 = €97

Elvira will have €97 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2 to it. 

Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16. 
Adding $2 to that amount, we get 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2.

Cost of pants = (Cost of hat + Cost of jacket) / 2
= ($25 + $75) / 2
= $100 / 2
= $50

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform.

Total cost of uniform = Cost of hat + Cost of jacket + Cost of pants
= $25 + $75 + $50
= $150

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs from each group and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to add the minimum payments for all debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum monthly payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

To pay 50% more, we multiply the total by 1.5: $1000 * 1.5 = $1500

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we first need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation to find the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. The equation would be:

$10 (revenue per gallon) * number of gallons = $25 (profit) + C (total cost)

However, we don't know the number of gallons yet. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Let's denote the number of gallons as G. The total cost is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar, which is $5 * G.

Now we have two equations:

$10 * G = $25 + C
$5 * G = C

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:

$10 * G = $25 + $5 * G

Subtracting $5 * G from both sides:

$5 * G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5:

G = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost:

C = $5 * G
C = $5 * 5
C = $25

Since the total cost is $25, and the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, the amount spent on lemons is:

$3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

Since there are 80 Japanese participants, and the total number of participants is 240, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total to find the number of Chinese participants: 
240 - 80 = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
160 - 60 = 100

Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.
4. The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.
5. The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.
7. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on them is 200 + 700 = 900$.
9. The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks to find the total amount he earned:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40. 

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. To do this, we need to know the total number of red roses that were originally ordered. 

However, the problem does not provide this information. But we can infer that the number of red roses that were originally ordered is at least 160, since that is the number of red roses that Fred has delivered so far. 

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver at least 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can simply multiply the time taken by each member: 55 seconds * 4 members = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we can calculate the time taken by each member as follows:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was greater than 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) + P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/2 + 1/2
= 1

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) = 1 - P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= 1 - 1/2

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used for the rabbits from the total straw used. 

Total straw used among small rodents = Total straw used - Straw used for rabbits
Total straw used among small rodents = 160 - 20
Total straw used among small rodents = 140

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'x'. The total number of rats is 3x.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used among the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total straw used among the rats is 140, so we can set up the equation:
18x = 140

To find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:
x = 140 / 18
x = 7.78 (round down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a rat)

So, there are 7 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $100
Rate = 2% or 0.02
Time = 3 months

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, to find the total amount Mandy should pay, we add the interest to the principal:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we can find the total number of bags by adding the total transportation cost to the total cost:
Total cost of bags and transportation = Total transportation cost + Total cost
Total cost of bags and transportation = $140 + $260
Total cost of bags and transportation = $400

Since the total cost of bags and transportation is equal to the total revenue, we can set up an equation:
Number of bags * ($20 + $2) = $400
Number of bags * $22 = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $22
Number of bags = 18.18

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 18 bags.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Daily amount of insects needed = Weekly amount / Number of days
= 3.5 / 7
= 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the initial number of trees: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots to be distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, he gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total earnings = (Weekly salary * Number of weeks) + Monetary reward
Total earnings = ($2100 * 52) + $5000
Total earnings = $109,800 + $5000
Total earnings = $110,800

The final answer is: $110,800"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes first. 

Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres, the total number of tons of grapes is 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced is 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

The final answer is 100."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To get the total score of 558, we need to add the required score to 358. 

558 - 358 = 200.

So, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total distance Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
Distance = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week
Total distance in the first period = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
Distance = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week
Total distance in the second period = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance Micheal rode his bike = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 3 plates. 

So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups: $16800 / 240 = $70.

The final answer is 70."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

4x + y = 60, where x is the number of babysitting sessions and y is the number of lawn mowing sessions.

Since we know that 12 babysitting sessions will earn her $60, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

4(12) + y = 60
48 + y = 60
y = 12

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first day. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 

On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first day, the second day, and the third day. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms: 3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides: 3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3: x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round down to 133 customers on the first day.

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day: 133 + 50 = 183.

Finally, we can find the number of customers on the third day: 183 + 50 = 233.

The final answer is 233."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We know this is equal to y, so we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three in three years:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, which is 30 liters. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is 48%."

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many melons were remaining, we subtract the initial number of harvested melons from the total.

Remaining melons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining melons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many melons were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested melons from the remaining melons.

Melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees separately.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

So, Ram can make 25 new pens from the ink of the 25 pens. 

The total number of pens Ram will have is the sum of the original 25 pens and the 25 new pens.

25 original pens + 25 new pens = 50 pens

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He receives 2 letters a week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

The total number of letters he writes per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we subtract the total minutes used from his plan to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 50% of the total number of students. The total number of students in the school is:
3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students
Number of boys in the school = 50% of 60 students
= 0.5 * 60
= 30 boys

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to Jamal's apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can calculate the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is 62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she already had (5 boxes * 50 marbles per box) to the marbles she received from her friend (20 marbles).

First, let's calculate the total marbles she already had: 5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Then, we add the marbles she received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan amount) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in each house. 

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Additionally, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of windows in each house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. So, the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800, and the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Now, we add the number of team members and their guests: 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, the number of beads that can fit in the remaining space is 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.

In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:

Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The remaining stars are 5-star rows. Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 + 5x. 

Since the total number of stars on a flag is 76, we can set up the equation: 
24 + 12 + 5x = 76 
36 + 5x = 76 
5x = 40 
x = 8 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we need to first determine its speed. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T / 11

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T / 11

Combine like terms:

39 = 10T / 11

Multiply both sides by 11 to isolate T:

39 * 11 = 10T

429 = 10T

Divide both sides by 10:

T = 429 / 10

T = 42.9

Since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the total number of medals given out, which should be a whole number. 

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 42.9, but since it's not possible to have a fraction of a medal, we can round it to the nearest whole number."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Since there are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she earns: 150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15. 

So, Susan earns $15 for the online task."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is 83."

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on each day. 

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

120 (target) - 65 (total sold) = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made after the initial bid is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids are $200 (initial bid) + $50 (first increment) = $250, $300, $350, and $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 (initial bid) + $250 + $300 + $350 = $800.

The desk costs Carmen $800."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

The bakery sells 10 loaves of bread in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

Therefore, Sandy will also take 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

So, the person will grow 1 extra arm in 3 days, 1 extra leg in 5 days, and 1 extra arm in 9 days. 

In 15 days, the person will have 1 extra arm (at day 3, 9) and 2 extra legs (at day 5, 10, 12, and 13, but we only count the first two legs, so 2 extra legs). 

Therefore, the person will grow a total of 3 extra limbs (1 extra arm and 2 extra legs) in 15 days.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $700 + $500 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27 years.
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, and the population of Chile now is 3000 times the population of Chile six years ago. Let's denote the population of Chile now as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000 * (N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, so we can set up the equation:

3000 * (N - 6) = (1/2)P

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000 * (N - 6) = (1/2)(3000 * (N - 6))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000 * (N - 6) = 1500 * (N - 6)

Dividing both sides by 1500, we get:

2 = 1

This is a contradiction, which means that the given information is inconsistent. However, we can try to find a solution by using the given information in a different way.

We can rewrite the equation N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6) as:

2 * (N - 6) = C - 6

Substituting C = 46, we get:

2 * (N - 6) = 40

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

N = 26

Now that we have found Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile now. We can substitute N = 26 into the equation P = 3000 * (N - 6):

P = 3000 * (26 - 6)
P = 3000 * 20
P = 60000

The final answer is: 60000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (new marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we need to add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils. Since we don't know the number of pencils in each box, let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is (3x + 2) + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26 (given), we can set up the equation: 
(3x + 2) + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 2 + 46 = 26
3x + 48 = 26
3x = 26 - 48
3x = -22
x = -22/3

Since the number of pencils in a box cannot be negative, this equation doesn't have a valid solution. However, we can try to find a different approach.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. We also know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils. 

Let's assume the number of pencils in each box is 'x'. Then, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x. 

Since Jam has 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

We know that the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 72. So, we can set up the equation:
3x + 2 + 46 = 72

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 2 + 46 = 72
3x + 48 = 72
3x = 72 - 48
3x = 24
x = 8

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box is 8, we can find the total number of boxes needed. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils. So, the total number of boxes Jam has is 3 + 1 = 4.

The total number of boxes Jam and Meg have is 4 (Jam's boxes) + 1 (Meg's box) = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

So, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

We know that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded. Since the ratio is 2:1, for every 1 new record, 2 old records were traded. 

So, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the weekly expenditure and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly expenditure on food = $25
Weekly expenditure on treats = $20
Weekly expenditure on medicine = $100 / 4 = $25

Total weekly expenditure = $25 + $20 + $25 = $70

Total monthly expenditure = $70 * 4 = $280

Total yearly expenditure = $280 * 12 = $3360"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to first calculate the total number of plant pots she needs. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the number of pots she needs from the total she had: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:
0.3 * Total time = 15
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his time was spent sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5.
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20.
- Arcade tokens cost $5.

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. 

Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the total number of friends Morgan can invite is $60 / x.

However, we can make an assumption that the cost per person is the same for all friends. Since we don't have any information about the cost per person, we can assume that the cost per person is the same as the cost of one round of mini-golf, which is $5.

Now, we can calculate the number of friends Morgan can invite: 
$60 / $5 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, let's convert the daily pocket money to cents: $5 = 500 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lollipops: 4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: 500 cents - 100 cents = 400 cents.

Since she saves this amount for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: 400 cents * 5 = 2000 cents.

Now, let's convert the total savings back to dollars: 2000 cents = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get: 45 = 2S - 5.

Now, let's solve for S: 
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S
S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2 since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

And the number of people kicked out for physical violence:

3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 15

Therefore, 15 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

Since Sara had x points before, Sara had 4.67 points before. 

Now, we need to find out how many points Erin had before. Erin had 3x points, so Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 * 0.25 = 11 officers.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132
- Total cost for senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY saves 20% after considering the materials cost, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be 80% of the original cost, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320. 

Now, we need to find the cost of materials. Since the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is 320, and the original cost is 400, the cost of materials is 400 - 320 = 80.

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is 320.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours from each day. 

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is not given, we can assume that the total number of pieces is equal to the total amount spent, as the cost is directly proportional to the number of pieces.

Total number of pieces = Total amount spent / Cost per piece
However, we don't know the cost per piece. We can assume that the cost per piece is the total amount spent divided by the total number of pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as 'x'. Then, the cost per piece is $400,000 / x.

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= x - 160,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece
= (x - 160,000) * (400,000 / x)

To simplify the calculation, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces as a percentage of the total amount spent.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = (x - 160,000) * (400,000 / x)
= 400,000 - (160,000 * 400,000 / x)
= 400,000 - 64,000,000 / x
= 400,000 * (1 - 64,000 / x)

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces as a percentage of the total amount spent.

Percentage of functioning pieces = (400,000 * (1 - 64,000 / x)) / 400,000
= 1 - (64,000 / x)

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces as a percentage of the total amount spent.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 1 - (64,000 / x) * 100

However, we can simplify this further by using the fact that the percentage of faulty pieces is 40%. This means that 60% of the pieces are functioning.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 60% of $400,000
= 0.6 * 400,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she made a dozen (12) bread rolls and fed 6 children, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine how many socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, in total, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total to find out how many she has missed: 50 - 35 = 15.

Total cookies initially = 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away = 44 + 23 = 67

Cookies left = Total cookies initially - Total cookies eaten or given away
Cookies left = 65 - 67
Cookies left = -2

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, it seems there's an error in the problem statement. However, if we consider the calculation, it appears that there are 2 fewer cookies than the total number of cookies initially."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total interest by the number of months.

Monthly interest = Total interest / Number of months
Monthly interest = $1,825 / 5
Monthly interest = $365

So, Karan has to pay $365 per month.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The cost of supplies is $18. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue. 

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $36 - $18
Profit = $18

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the profit per hour is $18 / 4 cups/hour = $4.50 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x: 
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts: 165 / 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio:
- Betty's popsicles: 15 * 5 = 75
- Sam's popsicles: 15 * 6 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's: 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each will be $8 per month. 
So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34 per month.

So, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Recording time: half of 240 minutes = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to this gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To calculate the builder's total earnings for a year, we need to first calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of working days in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month. So, the total number of working days in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

The builder earns $50 per day, so his total earnings for a year would be 288 * 50 = $14,400.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we convert the total energy used to kilowatts:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

The new total energy used in 30 days:
2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

Now, we calculate the energy saved:
216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

Converting the energy saved to kilowatts:
135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

- A zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes of the one with 36 stripes has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is:
$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

"To find the initial number of corns, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new total of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 60 = 160."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before the jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate
Time taken to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time taken to read the book = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of these items is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Now, we need to find 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog, which will explode:
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, Joanne gathers S/2 apples from the shortest trees, and her sister gathers 3 times as many, so her sister gathers 3S apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500

We also know that T = 30 and 2T = 60, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

30 + S + A = 500

We also know that S/2 = 3S, so S = 60.

Now we can substitute S = 60 into the equation:

30 + 60 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + A = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

A = 410

So Joanne gathered 410 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 410"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size since it's half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

Elevation of Stanley's comb = 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet = 14,000 feet.

Since Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, we need to subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of Stanley's comb to find the distance Oliver must climb.

Distance Oliver must climb = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Oliver's elevation

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(3/3)x + 4 = 6

Simplify:

x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in original price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

Difference = Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans
= 8 - 2
= 6

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem by assuming that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10, and the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to each type, which is 3(x + 10) + 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 3x + 10 + 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 + 3x = 6x + 30

Combine like terms:

6x + 30 = 6x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is indeed the same.

Now, we know that each type of feeder attracts the same total number of birds. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10, and the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to each type, which is 3(x + 10) + 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 3x + 10 + 3x

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, but the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is not directly relevant to the problem.

Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash, and he plans to use this money to buy a ticket to the amusement park, we can set up an equation to find the total amount of money he has from selling the cards.

Let's say Kenny starts with x cards. He sells them for $1.5 each, so he gets 1.5x dollars from selling the cards. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he keeps 1/3x cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash, we can set up the equation:

1.5x - (1/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.33x = 50
1.17x = 50
x = 50 / 1.17
x = 42.71

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total guests = 36
Hotdogs per guest for half of the guests = 2
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total hotdogs needed - Total hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount:
Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means he had 5 cents left. So, the amount he spent on candy bars is 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars he bought:

375 / 75 = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees per 10 minutes
Time the window is open = 30 minutes = 3 intervals of 10 minutes
Total cooling effect = 2 * 3 = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase:
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Cooling effect
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James finishes the swim 10% faster. 
10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. 

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Jon's total time = James' total time + 10 minutes

Let's denote James' run time as x. 
Jon's total time = 36 + 85 + 50 = 171 minutes
James' total time = 36 + 85 + x

171 = 36 + 85 + x
171 = 121 + x
x = 171 - 121
x = 50

So, James' run time is 50 minutes."

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60. 
1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 
So, Movie B's length = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, 
Movie A's length = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the total cost of the hay as follows: 
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail 
Total cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * 3 
Total cost of hay = 24 dollars 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 

Now, we can find the change by subtracting the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: 
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay 
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars 
Change = 6 dollars

"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

The cost of buying a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and a soda. 

So, we can set up the equation: $15 + P = $21 + $2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: $15 + P = $23.

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get: P = $8.

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost of filling 1 balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $900 / 20
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $45

Now, the cost of filling one balloon increased by $20. 

New cost of filling 1 balloon = Original cost + Increase
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $45 + $20
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost of filling 1 balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards)
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards)
= 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. 
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 3700 / 2250 = 1.64.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is the sum of earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles, which is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4. So, her monthly earnings is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. To do this, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"To calculate the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to break it down by item and then multiply by the number of rooms.

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces of laundry per room.

To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms:

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the remoras to feet by dividing by 12: 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents: (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can solve for total_students in the second equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20
total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of students with desktop computers:

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find her age in four years. Since in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote Angela's current age as A and Brett's current age as B. We know that in four years, Angela's age will be A + 4 and Brett's age will be B + 4. According to the problem, A + 4 = 3B.

We are given that Brett is 14 years old, so B = 14. 

Now we can substitute B into the equation: A + 4 = 3(14)
A + 4 = 42
A = 42 - 4
A = 38

So Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To find out how many greek orange pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. 

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + 7 + B/2 = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible since they provide more sticks per dollar. 

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24: 
$24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks from these 4 pieces.

Now, he has $24 - (4 * $6) = $0 left. He can't buy any more 2 x 8 pieces, so he will buy 2 x 4 pieces to make up the remaining amount.

He can buy 2 * 2 = 4 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces.

In total, Frederick can make 1600 + 4 = 1604 popsicle sticks.

The final answer is 1604."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose the weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of days: 
August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October (31 days) + November (30 days) + December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 or 29 days, depending on the year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 308 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total number of days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 308 days
Daily calorie deficit ≈ 340 calories

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 340 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation: 

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3 * Lot cost + Lot cost = 120,000
4 * Lot cost = 120,000

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot:
Lot cost = 120,000 / 4
Lot cost = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the lot cost by 3:
House cost = 3 * 30,000
House cost = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The total amount of money Ali has initially is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80.
The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.
The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Initially, there are 48 passengers.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as 'x'. Then, the amount he saves in the second half would be '2x'. 

The total savings for the first half of the month would be 15x. 

Since Elvis wants to save a total of $1125, we can set up the equation: 15x + 2x = 1125.

Combine like terms: 17x = 1125.

Divide both sides by 17: x = 66.

So, Elvis saves $66 in the first half of the month. 

Now, we need to find the amount he saves in the second half. Since the second half is also 15 days, the amount he saves in the second half is 2x = 2 * 66 = 132.

Therefore, Elvis has to save $132 for each day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * 0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's assume Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. The equation would be: 
x + 4x = 100
Combine like terms: 5x = 100
Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27

Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy."

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000.

Commission for sales up to $1000: 
Commission rate = 30%
Total sales up to $1000 = $1000
Commission = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Commission for sales over $1000:
Total sales over $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission rate = 10%
Commission = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. Then, we multiply this time by 3 to find the time it takes to swim 3 miles: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). 

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 90 - 50
New angle = 40 degrees

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total. Since the older son is 12 and the younger son is 8, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find out how many packs James needs: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, we have the number of goals scored by each teenager: Richie (80), Mark (60), and Anna (35).

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he buys 3 wooden action figures per day. 
3 * 5 = 15 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he buys plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he buys 10 plastic action figures per day.
10 * 5 = 50 plastic action figures

Now, let's add the total number of action figures:
15 (wooden) + 50 (plastic) = 65 action figures

Peter will have 65 action figures by the end of the week.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly requirement by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
450 * 1.04 = 468

However, the actual temperature is 468, so we need to find the temperature that is 4% lower than the actual temperature.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned, which is 1600 / 200 = 8 units.

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, the total water needed is 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99 * 1500
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01 * 1500
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 5 * 1.75 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight after 5 weeks between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex initially invites 100 people. Each of these people invites 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invites 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total.

Now, we add the initial number of people invited by Alex (100), the additional guests they bring (200), and the additional guests brought by her friends (18). 

Total number of people = 100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 * 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 * 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 * 2 = 32 feet tall.

On Day 4, the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees

3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert all the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1 = 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2 = 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3 = 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) + 24 (additional) = 41 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 41 + 5 = 46 games

Total games after 3 years = 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 46 (Year 3) = 85 games

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of this amount, which is 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to first find out how many times it rotates in a month. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it will rotate 725 * 2 = 1450 times per mile. 

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tire will rotate 1450 * 400 = 580,000 times per month.

To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12. 
580,000 * 12 = 6,960,000 times per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

To do this, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year. 
10,440,000 / 6,960,000 = 1.5 years.

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the items is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is a common rate in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as follows:
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

The total cost of the items with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $6.70.

The final answer is: $-6.70"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 16 - 20 = -4. However, this is not possible as we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The problem states that each pole has 4 street lights, but it does not specify that each pole is a separate entity. It is likely that the 4 street lights at each intersection are actually 4 separate poles with 4 street lights each. 

If that's the case, then the total number of poles is 4 intersections * 4 poles per intersection = 16 poles. 

Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is 16 poles * 4 lights per pole = 64.

Now, if 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is 64 - 20 = 44.

The final answer is 44."

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces he chews: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 7 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 7 pieces, he has 20 - 7 = 13 pieces left.

Finally, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 13 / 2 = 6.5 pieces. Since you can't give away a fraction of a piece of gum, we'll round down to 6 pieces.

So, Jim has 13 - 6 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, convert Adam's current height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet

Now, subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year

Now, divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price. So, the amount paid by the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit is the selling price minus the cost. Since James sold 10 cars, the total selling price is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. The profit is $250,000 - $75,000 (10 * $7,500) = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

First, we find 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 women who can stay upright.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 10 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, so T = 16 + 3 = 19.

We know that R = T - 9, so R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we need to find the total number of stamps Max bought. The total number of stamps is the sum of the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps.

Total stamps = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish Tommy caught. 

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from it.

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $600. 

Let's assume he misses 'x' classes. Then, the total cost of the classes he attends will be (10 - x) classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends should be less than or equal to $600. So, we can set up the inequality:

(10 - x) * $60 <= $600

Now, let's solve for 'x':

(10 - x) * 60 <= 600
10 * 60 - x * 60 <= 600
600 - 60x <= 600
-60x <= 0
x >= 0

Since 'x' represents the number of classes Manny can miss, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both of them is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, we need to calculate his new monthly salary including the bonus: 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

The first website publishes 20 articles per day, and the second website publishes 10 articles per day. 

Total articles per day = 20 (political) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is:

Total articles in February = 30 articles per day * 28 days = 840 articles

"To find Steve's son's wife's age, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply this by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

1. Howie needs 2 cupcakes for himself.
2. He needs 2 cupcakes for his teacher.
3. He needs 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates, so 25 x 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cupcakes: 2 (for himself) + 2 (for his teacher) + 50 (for his classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Simplifying the equation:
x + 22000 = 70x

Subtract x from both sides:
22000 = 69x

Divide both sides by 69:
x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now, we need to find the total number of likes. We add the initial likes to the new likes:
319 + 20000 = 20119

The final answer is 20119."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila. The correct answer is $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, let's calculate the total sales for two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to get the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert 24 eggs into dozens. To do this, we divide 24 by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

24"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly rent: $5000
Monthly fuel cost: 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year as follows:

Total cost of the plane = Initial cost of the plane + (Monthly rent * 12) + (Monthly fuel cost * 12)
Total cost of the plane = $150,000 + ($5000 * 12) + ($10,000 * 12)
Total cost of the plane = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000
Total cost of the plane = $330,000

Therefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5

Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee: 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42. 

Roger also buys a donut for $2. The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3.
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they pool and share it equally, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 

Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we divide the total amount by 3 (the number of people).

12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each person would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the first 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The remaining 10 days were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the updated count of good days is 12 (initial) + 3 (new) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

The bamboo will reach 600 inches in 20 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs became 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 9 toys. However, he already had 4 toys, so he needs 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 8 (initially bought) + 5 (additional needed) = 13 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

This amount is Skyler's investment.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

The sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then add the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and the Cookie Monster have.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can add them up to find the total: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) = 202 cookies.

The total number of cookies they have is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the operations that were performed to extend the dress. 

First, we know that the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, we subtract 20cm from the final length to find the length before the lace trim was added: 
140 - 20 = 120cm

Now, we know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. We can set up the equation: 
x + 0.5x = 120

Combine like terms: 
1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5: 
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y:

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22, which doesn't give an integer value for x.

If y = 5, then 3y = 15, and 2x = 19, which doesn't give an integer value for x.

If y = 6, then 3y = 18, and 2x = 16, which gives x = 8.

So, the age of the younger twin is 8 years.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 months (10 years * 12 months/year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 20 * 120 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 28 * 120 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines cost + heartworm check cost). 
Since we don't know the heartworm check cost, let's represent it as x. 
So, 0.6 * (40 + x) = 24 + 0.6x. 
Now, we know the total bill is $125. 
So, 40 + x + 24 + 0.6x = 125. 
Combine like terms: 64 + 1.6x = 125. 
Subtract 64 from both sides: 1.6x = 61. 
Divide both sides by 1.6: x = 38.125. 
Now that we know the heartworm check cost is $38.125, we can calculate the total bill: 
40 + 38.125 = 78.125. 
John leaves with 125 - 78.125 = $46.875."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs $1. 
The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68.

"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, the total number of people is 57. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is also 50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."

The amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours.

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% gives us the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68%"

"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin gets 2 scoops for free. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy, we can divide 4 scoops by 3. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can only buy 1 set of 3 scoops, she can get 2 scoops for free. 

So, Erin should buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops, and get 2 scoops for free.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. 
After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.
After two weeks, Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Now, let's calculate the amount saved: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were down. She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are down is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. 

Since her arms were down for 3 minutes, the total number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were down is 3 * 550 = 1650 taps.

Now, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were up. She taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are up is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. 

Since her arms were up for 2 minutes, the total number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were up is 2 * 400 = 800 taps.

Now, we can find the total number of taps she made in 5 minutes by adding the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were down and when her arms were up. 

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to his car: $450 (potential damage) - $195 (cost of fixing the pothole) = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 pizzas in total, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by all the friends: 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43 slices.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the extra 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

First, we know the weights of the math and science books are 2 pounds each, so their total weight is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds and the English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth 1 small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the initial trade and 60 small buttons from the second trade, for a total of 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons.

She also has 20 large buttons.

So, Lorraine has 87 small buttons and 20 large buttons by the end.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:

Total hours = 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find the remaining people. 
Remaining people = Total people - People who think horse #2 will win
= 50 - 10
= 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - People who think horse #7 will win
= 40 - 24
= 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. So, if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of girls. 

3 * 6 = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we now know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has ($70) to the money Ava gave him ($45):

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total money he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows: 
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = Total cases / 2 = 250 / 2 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * Cases needed by the first house = 2 * 125 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. 

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read.

300 + 150 = 450

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, but this doesn't change the total number of books they read altogether.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

However, she also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $65 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $95.

The final answer is: $95"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.
The total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference.

20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has, which is 25. 

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends the same amount of time driving back, the total time taken for the round trip is:
Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time taken to drive back
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is:
Total time gone = Total time + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the available wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left will be 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

$800"
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the series and the cost of the older movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older, we need to find the number of remaining movies first.

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Number of older movies = 40% of the remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies
= $2000 + $800
= $2800

The final answer is: $2800"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the speed at which they hiked. 

The speed at which they drove is 50 miles per hour. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we calculate half of their driving speed: 
50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
Then, subtract 5 miles per hour from this: 
25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

Now, we know they hiked at 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 
20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars. 

64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 2 dollars."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.
On the extra days, they ride twice the usual amount, so that's 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times.
The total number of times they ride on the extra days is 6 times.
The total number of times they ride in a week is 9 times + 6 times = 15 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's assume the number of white fish Bob bought is x.

After adding the new fish to the pond, the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, the total number of orange fish is 2(4 + x) = 8 + 2x.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond after adding the new fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 4 + x + 17 = 24.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 21 + x = 24.

Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get: x = 3.

Therefore, Bob bought 3 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups: 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups have members bring back seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back seashells: 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each of these 6 groups has 9 members, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group to find the total number of seashells brought back: 6 * 9 = 54 seashells.

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount paid to all employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Since this is the amount paid in one month, the total amount paid to employees after three months will be:

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car is faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and the gold separately, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. There are 10 quarts left, so the initial amount is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 + 100 = 200.

Since he initially wanted to sell 100 candies, and he already sold 150, we need to find out how many more he needs to sell to reach his goal. 

To do this, we subtract the number of candies he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200). 

200 - 150 = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 more butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 101."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used: 
John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag: 
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (marshmallows used) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 
17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores. Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores.

John and DeSean can each have 8 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter = $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters = $0.625. Since there are three friends, the total cost for them is 3 * $0.625 = $1.875.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $0.25 + $1.875 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, which gives us S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting O = 2S and S = 2Z into the equation, we get:
2S + 2S + S + Z + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + Z + G = 10

We know that S = 2Z, so we can substitute S with 2Z:
5(2Z) + Z + G = 10
10Z + Z + G = 10
Combine like terms:
11Z + G = 10

We also know that S = 2Z, and since S = G, we can substitute G with 2Z:
11Z + 2Z = 10
Combine like terms:
13Z = 10

Now, divide both sides by 13:
Z = 10/13

Now that we know Z, we can find S:
S = 2Z
S = 2(10/13)
S = 20/13

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(20/13)
O = 40/13

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 40/13 ≈ 3.08

The final answer is 3.08."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half the time she walked on the first day. Half of 8 hours is 4 hours. 

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35.

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the number of cars that remained, we subtract 35 from 70, which is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the shipping cost per pound and add the distance multiplied by the shipping cost per mile.

Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles

Total shipping cost = (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile)
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Total shipping cost = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate the refund amount.

Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75
Refund amount = $24

To find out how much money Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.

Total cost of the book and shipping: $32 (book) + $3 (shipping) = $35
Loss = Total cost - Refund amount
Loss = $35 - $24
Loss = $11

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is:
- 4 mirrors: 4 * $129.00 = $516.00
- 2 shelves: 2 * $129.00 = $258.00
- 1 chandelier: 1 * $129.00 = $129.00
- 10 pictures: 10 * $129.00 = $1290.00

Total cost of standard items: $516.00 + $258.00 + $129.00 + $1290.00 = $1993.00

Angela needs 6 mirrors, so the additional cost for mirrors is: 6 * $15.00 = $90.00
Angela needs 2 chandeliers, so the additional cost for chandeliers is: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Angela needs 20 pictures, so the additional cost for pictures is: 20 * $15.00 = $300.00

Total additional cost: $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $420.00

Total cost for Angela: $1993.00 + $420.00 = $2413.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. 

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance traveled = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is:

Speed of each turtle = Speed of kangaroo / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance as 3 kangaroos. Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the ratio of the speeds to find the time. The ratio of the speeds of the kangaroos to the turtles is 3:1. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.

Time taken by 4 turtles = 2 * Time taken by 3 kangaroos
Time taken by 4 turtles = 2 * 18 hours
Time taken by 4 turtles = 36 hours

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current cows produce. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk the current cows produce is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters of milk.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows to produce 10 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone."
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks they have together, we add the number of dishes and socks.

60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1615.28."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

Total amount spent on shoes in a year = $2640
Number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Average cost per pair of shoes = Total amount spent on shoes in a year / Number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

The final answer is 110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75. 
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. 
However, we get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the actual cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48. 
The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90, so 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), so 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20: 
10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total:
$20 - $2 = $18

Now, we add the amount Julieta received to Rafaela's amount:
$18 + $20 = $38

The total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is $38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total number of oranges given away from the total number she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, she raised 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 
The number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides: 
x = 40 
Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We can subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the number of yellow cars.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total amount of jello needed, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. 

There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required. 

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

$40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Her hourly rate is $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the scores from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

Total money from selling chickens = 180 * $50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he bought must be:

Total cost = Total money from selling chickens - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

To find the cost of one chicken, we can divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Number of chickens
= $7000 / 180
= $38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people in total. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the original rope, which is 20 meters long, and it costs $2 per meter, so the total amount she has is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she has:
$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's say the number of years is x. 
So, 8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 * 2 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, we know that each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since Kelly can't have a negative amount of money, this means she has overspent her budget."

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. 

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. This includes the cost of 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We already know the cost of the salad ($6) and the yogurt ($3). 

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. The total cost of the carrots is 2x. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is the sum of the costs of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt: 2x + 6 + 3 = 11.

Now, we can solve for 'x': 
2x + 9 = 11
2x = 11 - 9
2x = 2
x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from each lawn. 

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn 'x' times, the total amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x. 

The total amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3x * $6 = 18x. 

The total amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5x * $6 = 30x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x. 

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80. 

54x = 80 

x = 80 / 54 

x = 1.48 (approximately)

Now that we know the value of x, we can calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. 

Total amount from mowing lawns = 54x = 54 * 1.48 = $79.12 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $79.12 = $0.88. 

The final answer is 0.88."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Then, 3x = 7 (since Martha had 3 times as many as Joseph)
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4 * 2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, let's find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number of each.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial blue shoe boxes = 7
Blue shoe boxes used for fishing = 3
Blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial red shoe boxes = 9
Red shoe boxes used for fishing = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, in 30 days he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs: 3000 / 1000 = 3.

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

3"
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce in the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find the total number of fruits initially, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

24 / 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time taken for a round trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially put into the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate it as follows:

Pool water = 10000 gallons
Initial water in the tank = Pool water / 2 = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the remaining water after 6 days as follows:

Remaining water = Initial water in the tank - (Emptying rate * Number of days)
= 5000 - (500 * 6)
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Let's assume he wants to buy a ticket for this night. He can buy $134 / $10 = 13.4 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left after buying 13 tickets. He will spend $10 * 13 = $130. So, he will have $134 - $130 = $4 left.

Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can't buy any more tickets with the remaining $4.

Therefore, Colby can see 13 movies this month."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying this, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 23."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we subtract that from the total number of tables they need.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The additional hours will cost 70 pesos per hour. So, 5 hours will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron will be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay would be 1600 pesos. 

Cameron will save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money: 250 - 50 = 200 dollars.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge. 

First, we calculate the labor charge: 
2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Now, we add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge: 
$40 (fixed charge) + $78.75 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $178.75

The total cost is $178.75."
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate it as follows:

Distance swum = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim at half the speed:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and finishing the remaining distance:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Finishing time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission = Commission from the New York Times + Commission from the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent this as an equation: 

M = 0.5L

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can represent this as another equation:

M = D - 5

Substituting the value of D (Deanna's age) into the second equation, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

21 = 0.5L

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides by 2:

42 = L

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

First, we find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of 15-minute intervals.
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval.
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time.

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep while sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes.

Now, we add the time she was asleep while sleepwalking to the time she was awake before sleepwalking and the time she was awake after waking up.

475 minutes (total sleep time) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking time) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 503 minutes

The final answer is: 503"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first convert two dozen to the number of cups: 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: (2/3) * 24 = 16 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of measuring spoons and cups: 24 cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils.

34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

The remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we first need to find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried 1 ball. 

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the value of S from the third equation into the second equation to get: X = (4A - 13) + 5, which simplifies to X = 4A - 8.

Now we can substitute the values of X and S into the first equation: A + (4A - 8) + (4A - 8) = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 16 = 339.

Add 16 to both sides: 9A = 355.

Divide by 9: A = 39.44 (round down to 39 since you can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(39) - 13 = 155 - 13 = 142.

So, Stan has caught 142 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up back at her southern home, we need to consider the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 110 miles south, for a total of 410 miles south from her northern home. 

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the same as the total distance traveled in the southerly direction, which is 410 miles.

The final answer is: 410"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.
So, Nani's sister is 8 - 6 = 2 years old.

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 2 = 26 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of cherries, we can say that Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $520

"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen. However, her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total hours by the bottle size: 32 / 8 = 4.

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."

The price of the blue car is $100.

The price of the red car is $60.
The price of the blue car is $100."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads from each person: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of students in each group. 

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each plant and the space between them:
Width of each plant = 12 inches
Space between each plant = 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches
Total space required for each plant and the space between them = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the total space required for each plant and the space between them:
Total number of plants Pat can fit = 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4
Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Now, calculate the total cost of the plants:
Number of plants Pat can buy = 44
Cost of each plant = $6
Total cost = 44 * $6 = $264

The final answer is: $264"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil they bought:

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute) to get 15 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to add the peeling time to the cooking time. So, the total time is 15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, let's subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a difference from the initial temperature. Let's call the initial temperature 'x'. 
Final temperature = x - 14 degrees

The problem asks for the difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature. Since the final temperature is x - 14 degrees, the difference is:
x - (x - 14 degrees) = 14 degrees

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since his dad was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet for the first time, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 90 - 30 = 60 years.

Now, we know that 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and 60 years have passed since Bill saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is equal to the number of years that have passed since Bill saw the comet for the first time. 

So, 75 = 60 + x. 

Solving for x, we get x = 75 - 60 = 15.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane's flights are split between Greece, France, and Germany. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 0.75 = 66 flights. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22, and then divided by 2, which equals 11 flights.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30. 

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4).

We also know that the total age of the children is 20, so 3 + 4 + H + W = 20. 

We can simplify the first equation to H = (7 + W) / 2. 

Now, substitute H in the second equation: 3 + 4 + (7 + W) / 2 + W = 20. 

Combine like terms: 7 + (7 + W) / 2 + W = 20. 

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 14 + 7 + W + 2W = 40. 

Combine like terms: 21 + 3W = 40. 

Subtract 21 from both sides: 3W = 19. 

Divide both sides by 3: W = 19 / 3. 

W = 6.33."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

Half of the cookies = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, the total number of slices is 4.

Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the total number of chocolate bars in the boxes sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and then divide by the total number of boxes.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 
Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

Weekly earnings = (Cost to rent the studio per week) + (Cost per student per week)
Weekly earnings = $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) * 3 (days)
Weekly earnings = $25 + $45
Weekly earnings = $70

Now, let's calculate the monthly earnings:

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $70 * 4
Monthly earnings = $280

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $280."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes for each person.

For Peter: 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box: 16 - 8 = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Total number of porcupines = Initial number of female porcupines + Total number of babies born in a year
= 30 + 48
= 78

The final answer is 78."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

8230 * 0.10 = $823

The cost to fill the pool will be $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, during the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 28%
34% = 28%

However, this equation is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the situation. We know that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, so the charge remaining after 8 hours would be:
100% - (7% * 3) = 100% - 21% = 79%

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, so we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
100% - (9% * 5) + (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% + 21% = 28%
76% = 28%

Now, we can find the initial charge:
100% - 76% = 24%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 24%.

"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly income and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's price.

First, let's calculate her total weekly income:
- Wages: 40 hours/week * $10/hour = $400/week
- Tips: 40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week
- Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment:
- 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the total amount needed by her weekly income:
- $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 6 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, she will get 0.75 * 24 = 18 points from the easy questions.

The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since they are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by adding the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is 12."

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can apply the same price per sandwich to the third package with 8 sandwiches. 

The price for 8 sandwiches would be 8 * $1.5 = $12.

Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2
Total number of blue balloons = 6 (already had) + 2 (added) = 8

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
Red balloons = 15
Green balloons = 7
Yellow balloons = 6
Blue balloons = 8
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 0.70

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.70 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first determine the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Now, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

450"
"To calculate Melissa's total earnings, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Daily earnings: $15 per day
Total earnings for 3 days: $15 * 3 = $45

Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total parking expenses for 3 days: $3 * 3 = $9

Total earnings after expenses: $45 - $9 = $36

Now, let's calculate her hourly earnings:
Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours
Hourly earnings: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is $2."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs, we need to calculate the total number of apples in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box, so in two boxes, there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000/year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay:
Total amount of money needed to repay = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, the number of years it will take him to repay the loans is:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000/year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find the total area of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to get the total amount of fabric needed: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height in inches = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

"To find the total hours of work done by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

3 weeks = 21 days
3/8 = 0.375

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the team by 4:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * Depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,318
= $12,482

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * Depreciation rate)
= $12,482 - ($12,482 * 0.21)
= $12,482 - $2,618.82
= $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed, so he needs to wash 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week. 

Total sets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sets per week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do 4 loads per week (2 twin sets and 1 king set).

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads per year: 
9 sets per week * 52 weeks per year = 468 sets per year.

Since he does 4 loads per week, the total number of loads per year is:
468 sets per year / 4 loads per week = 117 loads per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter. 

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces in an hour. 

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 is 1.25 times 12)
Cost of 1.25 dozen roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can convert $6.25 into quarters as follows:

$6 = 6 * 4 = 24 quarters
$0.25 = 1 quarter

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 24 + 1 = 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: 162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed until the fourth train arrives.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after 10 minutes, so it arrives at 40 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives at 60 + 60 = 120 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 120 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives at 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (120 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (140 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 120 + 140 = 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect. Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks. 

80 / 10 = 8

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x. The selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 4 * 60 = 240 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home. 

The total distance he walked is 2 + 2 = 4 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store and back home."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then the total cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we have already accounted for 150 + 45 = 195 bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 195 = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on these days. 
1/16 of his weekly minutes are spent on these days. 
There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes. 
1/16 of 420 minutes is 420 / 16 = 26.25 minutes. 
Since this is the total extra time for both Saturday and Sunday, we divide by 2 to get the extra time for each day. 
26.25 / 2 = 13.125 minutes per day.

Now, we add the extra minutes to the total minutes spent in classes. 
200 minutes + 13.125 minutes = 213.125 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
213.125 minutes / 60 = 3.52167 hours

The final answer is 3.52."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 2 times 270 kilograms, which is 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the initial amount was 2 times 540 kilograms, which is 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Then, her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 6 unshaken sodas. 

Now, Ellen's friend can choose from the 6 unshaken sodas. Since there are 6 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas, the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, the number of days Billy is available to help is 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is 150."

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) 
Total minutes per day = 30 + 30 
Total minutes per day = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

Total hours per day = 60 minutes / 60 
Total hours per day = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this for 5 days, we multiply the total hours per day by 5.

Total hours for 5 days = 1 hour * 5 
Total hours for 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00. So, the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This also means that the number of large jellyfish that stay blue is x/5 - 6.

Since the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Ben and then Caroline's age based on the given information.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can calculate Caroline's age since she is three times older than Ben:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years. 

The total amount she needs to save is her annual savings multiplied by the number of years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. 

Assuming she has been working for 0 years, she needs to work for 60 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This gives us 100 / 4 = 25 cm per part.

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This gives us 25 / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume he is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. So, the total amount she spent on the books is $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 / 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 5
Difference: 8 - 5 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total distance for one trip: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the one-way distance by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply 10 miles by 7 days to get the total distance she will walk in 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 5 workers are available, and 4 of them have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Adding Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog, we get 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of his stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the total number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know A is also 9.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 by 16 to get 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces, which is also 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie and her brother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries. 

Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, let's denote her brother's salary as x. Then Valerie's salary is x/2. 

We know that Valerie's salary is $5000, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 5000. 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 10000. 

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. 

Now, we know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is 10000 + 5000 = 15000. 

Their mother's salary is 2 * 15000 = 30000. 

The total amount of money they all have together is 10000 + 5000 + 30000 = 38000."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume she walks at a speed of x miles per minute on the beach. 

Given that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can set up the equation 2x * 40 = 2 miles. Solving for x, we get x = 1 mile per minute. 

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 miles per minute. 

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk by dividing the distance (1 mile) by the speed (2 miles per minute), which is 0.5 minutes. 

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 0.5 = 40.5 minutes.

The final answer is 40.5."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. Since he has two mugs, and we know one mug is 33 degrees, we can assume the other mug is also full, as he is able to drink the water after pouring from both mugs.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water he has is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 8 ounces from the x-degree mug (since he pours 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). 

The total amount of water Donny has now is 12 ounces. Since he can drink this water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (8 ounces * x degrees) = 12 ounces * 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

132 + 8x = 480

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

8x = 348

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 43.5

So, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 43.5 degrees.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, to find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 scoops / 3 scoops per 3 potatoes = 6 potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he consumes 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he consumes 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

240 / 12 = 20

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus: 
(9/14) = x/84, where x is the number of women on the bus.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. The revenue from selling 60% of his inventory is $84. To find the loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning to find the probability that both tickets are winners:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person gets T/3 seashells.

To find the number of seashells each person gets, we need to know the total number of seashells 'T'. However, we can express the number of seashells each person gets in terms of 'x':

Number of seashells each person gets = (5x + 5)/3

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we can add the lengths of both songs to find the total time.

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes
Total time = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand.

460 bottles (required) - 4200 (available) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is not possible since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles. This means that the demand of 2300 people exceeds the production capacity of Hortex.

The answer is that Hortex cannot meet the energy demands of 2300 people with its current production capacity."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2/3 (blue) = 8/3.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 8) * 100 = 75%

The final answer is 75."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day, he uses 2 face masks per day.

In 2 days, he will use 2 * 2 = 4 face masks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (7 * 2450) - 200 = 10 * 17150 - 200 = 171500 - 200 = 171300 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years and the 10th year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 171300 + 1000 = 235700

The total number of fruits the tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 235700."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get: 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting the second equation into the previous equation, we get: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so he has:

5 - 3 = $2

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into three equal parts - red, white, and purple. 

Let's denote the amount of paint used for each color as 'x'. Since there are three colors, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x. 

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of paint used for yellow is also 3x. 

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. Since the mural is divided into two halves, the total amount of paint used for all four colors is 12 pints. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 3x = 12 (since the yellow paint is also 3x). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 12. 

Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 2. 

Since x represents the amount of paint used for each color, the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs $12. We want to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. 

To do this, we can divide the total cost of the new box ($12) by the cost per cycle ($1) and then divide the number of pods in the new box (120) by the number of pods per cycle (1).

Number of cycles = Total cost of the new box / Cost per cycle
= $12 / $1
= 12

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Number of pods per cycle
= 120 / 1
= 120

So, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much he used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. 

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. 

He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. 

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 13 days."

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the value of W from the first equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt in an hour. So, his net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by his net rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

It will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400."
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. 

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation based on the given information is 4x + 8 = 40.

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'x':
4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
5/11 * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice the height of Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation should be: 
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this still doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation again.

The correct calculation should be: 
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since the height of the second floor is 240 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4 miles

"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in those months is 25 * 11 = $275.

Now, we add the interest to the total amount he pays in the first 11 months: $275 + $6 = $281.

The remaining amount he owes in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $306 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers changed by both Jordan and his wife.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diapers changed per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan is also changing diapers, we need to subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total to find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day. 

10 (total diapers changed) - 5 (diapers changed by his wife) = 5 diapers changed by Jordan per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then find the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans is 900 - 864 = 36.

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since there are 3 grades (4-7), the total number of students is 10 * 3 = 30.

To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 30 / 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't use the full 45 minutes, we'll assume they'll use the remaining time in the next group. 

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. 

Since Karen is getting both services, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services. 

First, we calculate the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of nail art to the discounted total: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the sum of the books on all shelves should equal 110.

The equation can be written as: B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms: 1.5B - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides: 1.5B = 115

Divide both sides by 1.5: B = 77

Now that we know the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, we can find the number of books on the middle shelf: B/2 = 77/2 = 38.5

Since we can't have half a book, we'll round down to 38 books on the middle shelf.

The top shelf can hold 77 - 5 = 72 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books on the shelves: 38 + 77 + 72 = 187

However, we know that Elly has 110 books. This means we need to recalculate the number of books on each shelf.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 77/2 = 38.5 books. We'll round down to 38 books.

The top shelf can hold 77 - 5 = 72 books.

The total number of books on the shelves is 77 + 38 + 72 = 187. Since we know Elly has 110 books, we need to recalculate the number of books on each shelf.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 72 books.

The total number of books on the shelves is 77 + 38 + 72 = 187. Since we know Elly has 110 books, we need to recalculate the number of books on each shelf.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 72 books.

Since the total number of books is 110, we can see that the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books.

Now, let's calculate the number of bookcases needed. Each bookcase has 3 shelves. Since the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books, we can see that 3 bookcases can hold 77 + 38 + 38 = 153 books.

Since 153 is less than 110, we need more bookcases. We can add one more bookcase to hold the remaining 110 - 153 = -43 books. However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of books.

Let's recalculate the number of books on each shelf. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 38 books.

Since the total number of books is 110, we can see that the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats from the remaining hats. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 70) + (40)
Total questions = (0.7 * 70) + 40
Total questions = 49 + 40
Total questions = 89

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly in the first test:

Correct answers in the first test = 60% of 70
Correct answers in the first test = (0.6 * 70)
Correct answers in the first test = 42

To find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers in the first test from the total number of questions:

Questions needed on the second test = Total questions - Correct answers in the first test
Questions needed on the second test = 89 - 42
Questions needed on the second test = 47

The final answer is 47."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is equal to 116. We can write this as an equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the equation 5s - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of rooms with small candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of rooms with medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4

Total number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Total number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people in the house. So, the total number of flashlights = 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 (candles) + 4 (flashlights) = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete all six sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week. 

Since he spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he spends 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day on calls.

In a 5-day work week, he spends 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes on calls.

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is 1800 / 15 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8.

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Now, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost:
7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts: 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then find out how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in 1 minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since there are 450 words in a page, we can find out how many words John can speak in 1 minute by multiplying the words per second by 60.

Words per minute = 0.16 words/second * 60 seconds = 9.6 words per minute

Now, we can find out how many minutes it would take John to speak 10 pages by dividing the total number of words by the words per minute.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Time taken = Total words / Words per minute = 4500 words / 9.6 words/minute = 468.75 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Time taken (hours) = 468.75 minutes / 60 = 7.8125 hours

The final answer is: 7.8125"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons. 

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

So, the total number of lemons required is 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption of dog food is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know that there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets is 2 adult tickets + 1 child ticket = 2 * $12 + $8 = $24 + $8 = $32.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

The total cost is $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To find out how much feed Dexter has left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs John will serve and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 + 18 = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). In 2 weeks, he is open 5 * 2 = 10 days.

He services 3 cars per day, so in 10 days, he services 3 * 10 = 30 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 30 cars, he makes 30 * 4 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
   - 2 sugar cookies

Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

6 oatmeal cookies + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 2 sugar cookies = 15 cookies"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 28 by 7 to get the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 * 2 = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can express this as 2A = 4. 

From the second equation, we can find Aaron's speed: A = 4 / 2 = 2 miles per minute.

Now, we know Aaron's speed and the distance he ran. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

For Aaron, time = 2 miles / 2 miles per minute = 1 minute.

Since Aaron's time is 1 minute, and he runs half the distance of Vanessa, Vanessa's time will be twice Aaron's time. Therefore, Vanessa's time = 2 * 1 minute = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine.

Cost of meals per night: 6 reservations * 2 meals * $5 per meal = $60
Cost of wine per night: $5
Total cost per night: $60 + $5 = $65

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The labor cost is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost. 

Total cost = $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 40 - 2b + 4b = 70, which simplifies to 2b = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into c = 20 - b, which gives us c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
