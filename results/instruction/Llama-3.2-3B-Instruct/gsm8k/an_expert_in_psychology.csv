"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

Janet sells each egg for $2, so she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber separately. 

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to first determine the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, we can calculate the total number of sprints per week as follows:

3 sprints/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 sprints/week

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we can multiply the total number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint:

9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed per chicken is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 20 * 2 = 40 cups.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1. The first 3 hours of driving at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

2. The next 2 hours of standstill traffic: 
Since he didn't move, the distance covered is 0 miles.

3. The next 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) of driving at 30 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. The remaining 1.5 hours (or 90 minutes) of driving at 80 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances covered in each segment: 
Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, we need to subtract this from the total distance to find the distance from home: 
Distance from home = 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then add the earnings for the overtime hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $10, so for the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 hours, and the overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is:
1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

The number of overtime hours worked is 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
So, her earnings for the overtime hours would be:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50/year

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this calculation is incorrect as it assumes the tree will not produce any lemons in the first year. We need to recalculate the break-even point.

Let's calculate the net profit for each year until the tree starts producing lemons:

Year 1: $0 (no lemons)
Year 2: $7.50 (net profit)
Year 3: $7.50 + $10.50 = $18
Year 4: $18 + $7.50 = $25.50
Year 5: $25.50 + $10.50 = $36

At this point, the net profit is greater than the initial cost of the tree ($36 > $90). Therefore, it will take 5 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - (x/3 + 2) - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 1 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 3 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is greater than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can again consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days. 

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
= 80 miles + 150 miles
= 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching is 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year = $35,000.

Her annual salary from coaching is 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we can multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs per day = 3 eggs
Total days in 4 weeks = 28 days

Total eggs in 4 weeks = Total eggs per day * Total days in 4 weeks
Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days
Total eggs in 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

Total dozens of eggs = Total eggs in 4 weeks / 12
Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12
Total dozens of eggs = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the time she has left to cover the remaining distance is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance. 

Required speed = Total distance - Distance covered / Time left
Required speed = 12 miles - 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total: 29/3 - 1 = 28/3 liters.

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide 28 by 3: 28 ÷ 3 = 9 remainder 1, so 28/3 = 9 1/3 liters.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 9 1/3 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at son's birth = 25 - 23
25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the first stop. 

The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. Since the first stop was 20 miles from the beginning, we can subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip (45 miles) from the distance from the beginning to the first stop (20 miles).

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 - 45 = -25 miles

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - $5 = $99. 

Solving for B, we get B = $99 + $5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's current age:

Darrell's current age = 7x = 7(9) = 63

And Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins is equal to 110. 

The equation can be written as: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. 

After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

However, the problem states that he has $5 left, not $35. This implies that he actually spent $30 on video games ($35 - $5 = $30). 

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $30. We know that each Lego set is sold for $15. 

To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we divide $30 by $15, which equals 2. 

Since he initially had 13 Lego sets, he now has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, his weekly running distance is 6 miles.

To find his average running speed, we need to know the total distance he runs in a year. Assuming a non-leap year (365 days), his total yearly distance would be 6 miles/day * 365 days = 2190 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average running speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 2190 miles / 2190 hours (since 365 days * 7 hours/day = 2555 hours, but we are given 60 miles/week, so 60 miles/week * 52 weeks = 3120 miles, and 3120 miles / 60 hours/week = 52 hours/week, 52 hours/week * 52 weeks = 2704 hours)
Average speed = 2190 miles / 2704 hours ≈ 0.81 miles/hour

The final answer is 0.81."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Let's assume the total time is 6 hours. So, the time spent running is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walked = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the gemstone, we can multiply the original distance by 3. 

The original distance is 400 feet, so when holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have left: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we can calculate the total grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles. The cost of beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds is $10.00. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. We know that she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is the sum of the ones she had initially and the ones she used at work: 80 (initial) + 220 (at work) = 300.

Since she had 23 remaining, the total number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased must be the difference between the total used and the remaining ones: 300 (used) - 23 (remaining) = 277.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Total number of floors = 15
Number of occupied floors = 3/4 * 15 = 11.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a floor, we'll round down to 11 occupied floors.

Number of units per floor = 8
Total number of occupied units = 11 * 8 = 88

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units in the building.

Total number of units in the building = 15 * 8 = 120
Total number of unoccupied units = 120 - 88 = 32

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the weight of the comic books Uriah is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
Total revenue for Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$480 - $520 = -$40

The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue."
"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as follows:

Patchy's kittens = 3 * Trixie's kittens
Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we add the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie to find the total number of kittens:

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12
Total kittens = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

The total number of oranges that are not good is the sum of unripe and sour oranges, which is 5 + 2 = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension value increases by 5% each year, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years and then take 5% of that value.

The value of the pension after 20 years can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (in this case, 5%), and n is the number of years.

A = 50000(1 + 0.05)^20
A ≈ 50000 * 3.386
A ≈ 169,300

Now, we take 5% of this value:
5% of 169,300 = 0.05 * 169,300
= 8,465

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $8,465.

The total annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years:
$50,000 + $8,465 = $58,465

The final answer is: 58465"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial amount for the first half of the year and the reduced amount for the second half of the year.

The initial amount for the first half of the year is $140. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 * 6 = $840 for the first half of the year.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the reduced amount for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126. Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, Aleena paid $126 * 6 = $756 for the second half of the year.

To find the total amount she paid for the year, we add the amount paid for the first half of the year and the amount paid for the second half of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract the amount used from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We can do this by dividing the amount of gas she has left by the amount of gas she used to travel 100 miles.

To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the distance she traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the amount of gas she has left in the tank to find out how far she can drive on a single tank.

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. Since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 1 hour reading each time. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to first identify the number of rubies and emeralds. 

We know there are 175 diamonds. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Since there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:
Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we can calculate the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money she received from her weekly allowance. 

Weekly allowance: $5
Number of weeks: 8
Total allowance: $5 * 8 = $40

Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has.

Initial amount = Total amount - Total allowance
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to first calculate her daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 days a week. So, her daily earnings from weekdays are 5 classes/day * $15/class = $75/day.

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, her total weekly earnings from Saturday classes are 8 classes * $15/class = $120.

Now, let's add her weekday earnings and Saturday earnings to get her total weekly earnings: $75/day * 5 days = $375 + $120 = $495.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for the first month will be 2% of $150, which is $3. 

The total amount to be paid for the first month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

For the second month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3, and the total amount to be paid is $153 (previous month's payment) + $3 (interest) = $156.

For the third month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3, and the total amount to be paid is $156 (previous month's payment) + $3 (interest) = $159.

So, Shiela will pay $153 for the first month, $156 for the second month, and $159 for the third month.

The total amount paid over 3 months is $153 + $156 + $159 = $468.

The monthly payment for 3 months is $468 / 3 = $156."

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in the remaining 185 days of the year.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 730 cups (remaining 185 days) = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

So, Cecilia will need approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the amount of laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing Sarah's amount by 4. 

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's amount by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to determine how much water the two girls initially had together. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = 24 / 6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they had is 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water the boy got from the total amount of water. 

24 liters (initial amount) - 8 liters (water the girls had) - 6 liters (water the boy got) = 10 liters

So, there are 10 liters of water left.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 stickers for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away or used is 9 + 28 = 37.

Now, we subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used from the total number of stickers he had: 54 - 37 = 17.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be written as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the number of blocks from each year of his vacations. Since he goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we can calculate the number of blocks as follows:

1. Gene started vacationing at 23 years old, so the first year he went on vacation was at 23 years old.
2. He has been vacationing for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).
3. Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year of his vacations is equal to the number of years he has been vacationing.
4. Therefore, the number of blocks from each year of his vacations is 11 (11 years * 4 vacations per year).
5. To find the total number of blocks, we multiply the number of blocks from each year by the number of years: 11 * 11 = 121.

Gene has 121 quilt blocks in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang. 

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times. 
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times the alarm rang in each instance: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

We know that Lee's speed is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's speed is x + 2. We also know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is equal to the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can find his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 1.1 times his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 9.22 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, let's calculate the number of plants she will give away: 
She will give 1 plant from each of the 40 ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has: 
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water per meal, which is 3 meals per day. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water per meal, which is 2 meals per day. So, he drinks 2 glasses of water per day on weekends. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 3 inches
Width = 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 4 inches
Height = 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3. 

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to first calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups
Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can add the total number of roll-ups they had: 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The final answer is 12.8."
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

1800 = 6B

To find the value of B, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write another equation:

B = 50D

Since we already know the value of B, we can substitute it into the equation:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by the value of one part (6) to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

7 * 6 = 42

The final answer is 42."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is equal to one-third of the original number of letters needing stamps.

Let's denote the original number of letters needing stamps as x. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is x/3.

We are given that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. So, we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 30 * 3
x = 90

This means that Jennie had 90 letters needing stamps initially.

Later, she had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12 

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12 

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10 

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

Number of fish sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital's total cost per hour is $150, so the total cost per day is:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue per hour is:
$200 per hour

The total revenue per day is:
200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000

Now, we can calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to get:
2B + B + Q = 700
Combine like terms: 3B + Q = 700

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation: 
3(2Q) + Q = 700
Expand and simplify: 6Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms: 7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Now, we can calculate Kim's profit by subtracting his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest). 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks if he picks up all the legos.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Now, all the bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive. So, 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert Tim's distance to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute = 60 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 60 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

To find the waiting time, we subtract the time it takes for the loser to finish from the time it takes for the winner to finish:

Waiting time = Time taken by the winner - Time taken by the loser
Waiting time = 60 minutes - 40 minutes
Waiting time = 20 minutes

There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 (remaining) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

For the 3 days with 1-hour classes: 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
For the 2 days with 2-hour classes: 8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

"To determine the winner and the difference in distance run, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each person.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice, so his total distance is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering the entire length of the field, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 60 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 20 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the additional distance she covers is 60 yards * 34 = 2040 yards. Her total distance is 100 yards + 2040 yards = 2140 yards.

Since Blake runs 200 yards and Kelly runs 2140 yards, Kelly is the winner. The difference in distance run between the winner and the loser is 2140 yards - 200 yards = 1940 yards.

Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B. This gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $3 (cost of lemons and sugar) = $28.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar. We know that the total revenue is $28 and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Since they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons and sugar must be $28 - $25 = $3. 

Since the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, the cost of lemons must be $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to first determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

Since there are 80 Japanese participants, and the total number of participants is 240, the number of Chinese participants can be calculated as follows:

Total participants = Japanese participants + Chinese participants
240 = 80 + Chinese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far: 
1500 + 2000 = 3500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. 
Remaining amount after rent and fuel = 6000 - 3500 = 2500
Half of 2500 = 0.5 * 2500 = 1250
Amount donated to charity = 1250

Now, let's calculate the amount left after the donation: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. 
Amount left after giving to family = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, we add the earnings for both weeks to find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since we don't have any information about other items, we can assume that the total number of items ordered is the sum of these three. 

So, the total number of items ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x.

However, we are not given the total number of items ordered, but we know that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the total number of items ordered is at least the number of red roses that were not delivered. 

Since we don't know the total number of items ordered, we can't determine the exact number of red roses that were not delivered. However, we can express the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm as a fraction of the total number of items ordered.

Let's denote the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm as 'y'. We know that y is a fraction of the total number of items ordered, which is 10x. 

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we can assume that y is at least 1/10 of the total number of items ordered (since 1/10 of the items are red roses). 

So, y = 1/10 * 10x = x.

However, we still don't know the value of x. To find the minimum number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to find the minimum value of x.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

The number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm is at least x. 

Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can't determine the exact number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm. However, we can express the minimum number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm as a fraction of the total number of white carnations.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

We already know that J = M + 2, so we can substitute M = 21 into this equation: J = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the faster team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for the subsequent runners are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mom, we add their individual shares:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Then, the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18x = 90 and solve for 'x'. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we get x = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total revenue from selling 'x' bags at $30 each is 30x.

The total cost includes the cost of buying the bags at $20 each and the transportation cost of $2 each. So, the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. 

So, we can set up the equation: 30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get 8x = 400.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has over the 10-year period.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of trees Tom had after 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years. We add the net gain of 80 trees to the initial number of trees:

50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees

Now, we calculate 30% of 130 trees:

30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees

So, 39 trees die.

To find the number of trees Tom has left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:

130 (total trees) - 39 (trees that die) = 91 trees

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Total sentences = 1000
Sentences per publisher = Total sentences / 2
Sentences per publisher = 1000 / 2
Sentences per publisher = 500

Now, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the rate for Publisher B.

Rate for Publisher A = 5 cents
Rate for Publisher B = 2 * Rate for Publisher A
Rate for Publisher B = 2 * 5 cents
Rate for Publisher B = 10 cents

Now, we can calculate the total amount Mark earns from each publisher.

Earnings from Publisher A = Sentences per publisher * Rate for Publisher A
Earnings from Publisher A = 500 * 5 cents
Earnings from Publisher A = 2500 cents

Earnings from Publisher B = Sentences per publisher * Rate for Publisher B
Earnings from Publisher B = 500 * 10 cents
Earnings from Publisher B = 5000 cents

Now, we can find the total amount Mark earns in a week by adding the earnings from both publishers.

Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are $104,500.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We are also given that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Since half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates, the total cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Cost of 240 cups = Cost of 6 plates - $1200

We know the cost of 6 plates is $6000, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Cost of 240 cups = $6000 - $1200
Cost of 240 cups = $4800

Now, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups:

Cost of one cup = $4800 / 240
Cost of one cup = $20

The total cost of buying each cup is $20.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up an equation to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn:

$60 / $4 = x (number of times she needs to mow the lawn)

x = 15

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day. We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this total is 500.

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2: x = 225

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 225), we can find the number of customers on the second day: x + 50 = 225 + 50 = 275.

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is 225 + 275 = 500.

However, we are asked to find the number of customers on the third day. We already know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500, so the number of customers on the third day is 500.

The final answer is 500."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

4y = x - 16
4y = 24 - 16
4y = 8
y = 2

So, the small pool has 2 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

However, she will only pay $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows: 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 (Naomi) - 44 (Yuri) - 85 (Brianna) = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first find the number of petunias he plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 48%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the costs of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

The base burrito costs $6.50.
Extra meat: $2.00

Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Total cost of extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

The upgrade costs $3.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the extra items and the upgrade to the base burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle. 

Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide 360 by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle: 

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 

60 / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The remaining watermelons are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of melons ready for harvest, we multiply the remaining melons by 3/4, which is 84 * 3/4 = 63.

The number of melons not ready for harvest is the remaining melons after the second harvest, which is 84 - 63 = 21.

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we know that Kylie collected 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. 

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we know that Steve and his girlfriend eat a total of 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to determine how many vines they need.

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram is essentially diluting the ink from the original 25 pens to make new pens. Since he can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen, we can calculate the total number of new pens he can make.

First, we need to find out how many times the ink from the original 25 pens can be diluted to make new pens. Since each new pen requires 5 empty pens, we divide the total number of original pens by 5.

25 original pens / 5 empty pens per new pen = 5 new pens

However, this calculation only accounts for the original 25 pens. Ram will also have the 25 empty pens that he used to make the new pens. So, we need to add the original 25 pens to the 25 new pens.

Total pens = 25 original pens + 25 new pens = 50 pens

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 50 pens.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages exchanged per week:

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 6 (received) + 6 (sent) = 12 pages.

Since Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing per week:

12 pages * 6 minutes per page = 72 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 1.2 hours writing per week.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each person. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories on Monday and 26 * 200 = 5200 calories on Tuesday. Her sister consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 * 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday.

The total calories consumed by Sue is 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories. The total calories consumed by her sister is 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is half of the total number of students:

Number of girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of boys:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - Number of girls in the third class
= 30 - 3
= 27 boys

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps and then add the number of new apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of new apps downloaded: 18

Current number of apps = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted + Number of new apps downloaded
= 61 - 9 + 18

The current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 36 wolves today, and 15 cougars the previous night and 12 cougars today.

Total number of wolves = 10 + 36 = 46
Total number of cougars = 15 + 12 = 27

Total number of animals = 46 + 27 = 73

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
Therefore, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows were added to each stall. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. 

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall

Now, we know that each stall originally had 20 cows and 2 cows were added. 

20 cows (original) + 2 cows (added) = 22 cows per stall

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

22 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

The final answer is: 176"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

- 100 pennies = 100 cents = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 * 5 cents = 200 cents = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 * 10 cents = 200 cents = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 * $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. 

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% expressed as a decimal). 

Weight of eaten wood = 400 pounds * 0.3 = 120 pounds

Now, we need to find the weight of the remaining wood. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, the remaining wood is 70% of the total weight. 

Weight of remaining wood = 400 pounds * 0.7 = 280 pounds

The total weight of the redwood is the sum of the weight of the eaten wood and the weight of the remaining wood.

Total weight = Weight of eaten wood + Weight of remaining wood
Total weight = 120 pounds + 280 pounds
Total weight = 400 pounds

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to first calculate the cost of the overdue books and then add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount she owes is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52. 

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

The final answer is 128."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

To find the total amount of flour Carla needs, we add the flour required for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is 62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she initially had (5 boxes * 50 marbles per box) to the marbles she received from her friend (20 marbles).

Initial marbles = 5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles
Marbles received from friend = 20 marbles
Total marbles now = Initial marbles + Marbles received from friend = 250 + 20 = 270 marbles

The final answer is: 270"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, we add the total fees to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the selling price: $400,000 + $12,000 + $20,000 = $432,000.

Finally, let's subtract the loan amount from the total amount paid: $432,000 - $250,000 = $182,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $182,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes, we can calculate this as follows:

Time to heat up to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 0.4 * 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 8 minutes
= 28 minutes

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. Since it takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil, we can calculate this as follows:

Time to cook the chicken = Time to heat up to 400 degrees - 5 minutes
= 28 minutes - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

Finally, we need to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken. This is the sum of the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

Total time = Time to heat up to 400 degrees + Time to cook the chicken
= 28 minutes + 23 minutes
= 51 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in each house. 

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Additionally, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of windows in each house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

Since the mother paid $20, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. We can subtract these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the two sleeves. 
Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Number of stitches for the two sleeves = Total stitches - Stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
Number of stitches for each sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is 315."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two pieces of information: 

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so R = 6S.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation: 
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides: 
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides: 
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3: 
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals they have is 1/10 of the total number of medals given out. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. Then, we can set up the equation:

A + I = (1/10)T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = (1/10)T

Combine like terms:

39 = (1/10)T

Multiply both sides by 10 to solve for T:

390 = T

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars"
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there's a 30-minute break in between, we subtract that from the total hours worked. 

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert 2.5 hours into minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many $5 increments she earns.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 increments

Since each increment is worth $5, we multiply the number of increments by the value of each increment.

15 increments * $5/increment = $75

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He will wash 4 oranges.

In total, the two sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges initially, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for each day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. 

Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. 

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the desk, we need to consider the sequence of bids. 

The first bid is $200. The next three bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the three other people, so her bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

The final bid is $400, which is $200 (initial bid) + $50 * 3 (the number of other bids) + $50 * 3 (Carmen's three bids) = $200 + $150 + $150 = $400.

The cost of the desk to Carmen is $400."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1,800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1,800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

The final answer is: $45,000"
"To find out how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this scenario, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Elise sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. Since she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is 90 + 45 = 135. However, this contradicts our initial calculation. This means our initial assumption that she sold 90 books in the first year is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that she sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Let's say she sold x books in the first year. Then, she sold 2x books in the first year. We know that the total number of books sold is 200, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + 45 = 200.

Combine like terms: 3x + 45 = 200.

Subtract 45 from both sides: 3x = 155.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 51.67.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

First, let's calculate his regular earnings for the month. Since he works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, and there are approximately 30 days in April, his total hours worked in April would be:

10 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Since he earns $10 per hour, his regular earnings for the month would be:

200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Next, we need to add the bonus he received for the month. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he would receive a $300 bonus. 

Total earnings for April = Regular earnings + Bonus
= $2000 + $300
= $2300

The final answer is: $2300"

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that both Sandy and Joey are losing the same amount of weight, but Sandy is doing it over a longer period. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weight loss per week for Joey as follows:

Weight loss per week for Joey = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey:

Number of weeks for Sandy = Total weight loss / Weight loss per week for Sandy
Number of weeks for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts for his business partners.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by each group and then add them together.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

The remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the three individuals. 

We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that P = (1/2)P_now, where P_now is the current population of Chile. We can set up the equation:

P = (1/2)P_now

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)P_now

We can also substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)(2P_now)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(N - 6) = P_now

Now we can substitute the expression for N from the first equation:

3000((1/2)(C - 6) + 6) = P_now

Substituting C = 46, we get:

3000((1/2)(46 - 6) + 6) = P_now

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(20 + 6) = P_now

3000(26) = P_now

P_now = 78000

The final answer is: 78000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and then add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who couldn't come: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we add the number of people who couldn't come to the number of people who came: 16 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool is:

Cost = Volume * Price per cubic foot
= 120 * $0.1
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children. 

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. 

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the number of electric poles required. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we can subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men and add the number of people who left.

Number of men who left = 1/4 * 25 = 6.25 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 6 = 19

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.

Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Number of men who stayed
= 40 - 19
= 21

Therefore, 21 women are left at the party.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the cost of the magazine first. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 24. Then, we divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'x': x = 8.

So, Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, each containing 8 pencils, and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

This means the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker after adding the ice cubes.

Next, we need to add 15 milliliters of cream, which will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker. So, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Let's assume the 5 people brought x old records in total. Since the ratio is 2:1, the number of new records they received is x/2.

We are given that the 5 people left with 7 new records. This means that the total number of new records received is 7. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought 14 old records into the record store.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and then the number of senior programmers. 

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

We know that 20 people were on the bus at the third stop. 

At the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means that the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Since 5 people got in at the first stop, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A: 
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked in a year: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Net pay: $30,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $24,000

Job B: 
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Net pay: $36,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay of $32,400, while Job A has a net pay of $24,000. 

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each animal. 

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The container weighs 20 pounds. 

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240 pounds

"To find the increase in production, we need to calculate the daily revenue and production before and after the change.

Before the change:
Daily revenue = 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000
Daily production = 10 tractors

After the change:
Daily revenue = 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100
Daily production = 5 silos

To find the percentage increase in revenue, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100
Percentage increase in revenue = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100 = 10%

To find the percentage increase in production, we can use the same formula:
Percentage increase in production = (($5 - 10) / 10) * 100 = -50%

The factory is making 50% less per day in terms of production, but it is making 10% more per day in terms of revenue.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation. Let's call the total time spent on vacation 'x'. 

30% of x is equal to 15 hours, so 0.3x = 15. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 40% (or 0.4) by the total time spent on vacation (50 hours): 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of all the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so now Dean has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do:

- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining budget: $60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $55 / $10 = 5.5

Since we can't invite half a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 5 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is $0.25 per lollipop. 

Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days = $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money.

Total savings = Daily pocket money - Total cost of lollipops
Total savings = $5 - $5
Total savings = $0

Therefore, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

5.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two segments, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To determine the amount of stuffing needed, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 

For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing. 

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken to return home
= 3 hours + 3 hours
= 6 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. According to the problem, 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifting: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10
Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of points Sara had before as 'x'. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin's points can be represented as 3x. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to assume that Sara had 4 points before, as the question implies that Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8. 

So, Erin had 3 * 4 = 12 points before scoring 8.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors will receive cords.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132
- Total cost for all gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY costs 20% less than the market price, the cost of the DIY will be 80% of the market price. 

The market price is $400, so the DIY cost will be 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * 400 = $320.

Since the DIY cost is the sum of the cost of materials and the cost of labor, we can set up the equation: x + labor cost = 320.

However, the problem doesn't provide the labor cost. Assuming the labor cost is negligible or already included in the materials cost, we can assume the DIY cost is equal to the cost of materials.

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

The next day, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs sold.

Total pairs sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 52 - 6 = 46 pairs.

The final answer is 46."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Given that 40% of the equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000, the number of functioning pieces would be:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment would be the value of these pieces, which is 240,000.

The final answer is: 240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

First, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:
40 - 20 = 20

Now, we calculate one-fourth of the remaining pupils:
20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Since the rest of the pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:
20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples Lucy picked each day and then add them together.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, which means she picked the same number of apples on Monday as she sold. Since she sold them for $4 each and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount by the price per apple.

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
Total number of apples = 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday)
= 50 apples

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she sells and then find the total revenue and subtract the cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue. Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1 and she sells 4 cups per hour, her revenue per hour is 4 x $1 = $4. 

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for the entire day. Since she can make 36 cups of lemonade and sells 4 cups per hour, she will sell all the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours. Her total revenue for the day is $4 x 9 = $36.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the profit. The cost of supplies is $18. So, her profit for the day is $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we can calculate the profit per hour by dividing the profit by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls. This means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so they will sing with 26 girls.

However, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means half of the 26 girls won't be able to perform. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls won't be able to perform.

The choir's 3 teachers will also sing with them, so we need to add these 3 teachers to the number of girls who can perform. 26 - 13 = 13 girls can perform, and adding the 3 teachers, the total number of people singing is 13 + 3 = 16.

If Dasha buys 9 tickets at $2 per ticket, she will spend 9 * 2 = $18.

Together, they will spend $30 + $18 = $48.

If they buy tickets separately, David will spend $30 and Dasha will spend $18, for a total of $48.

"To calculate the savings, we need to first find the cost of the bundled services. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 = $20. Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate 20% of $20.

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 

So, the cost of the bundled services is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, we can find the total cost of the streaming services by adding the cost of Netflix to the bundled services. 

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled services) = $26.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package.

$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case. 

1/3 can be written as 4/12, and 1/4 can be written as 3/12. 

So, Jenny gave away 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12 of the pizza.

Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can find the number of slices given away by multiplying 7/12 by 12. 

7/12 * 12 = 7

Now, we know that Jenny gave away 7 slices. Since she started with 12 slices and ate 2, the number of slices left is 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount he has in his bank account and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially and needs $300 for the bike. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more than $300.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save more money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, if Mark saves his earnings every day, it would take him 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we need to first determine the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference in age between Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

First, we multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass: 
2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Then, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk.

"To calculate the builder's yearly earnings, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and gets paid $50 per day. So, his weekly earnings are 6 * $50 = $300.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his yearly earnings would be 52 * $300 = $15,600.

The final answer is: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the energy saved, we first need to find out the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we find the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total energy usage in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy usage to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we find the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

We multiply this by 30 days to get the new total energy usage in 30 days: 
2700 watts/day * 30 days = 81,000 watts

Now, we subtract the new total energy usage from the original total energy usage to find the energy saved: 
216,000 watts - 81,000 watts = 135,000 watts

Converting this to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. 
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, we have 34 + 36 = 70 stripes. 
The zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Adding this to the total, we have 70 + 18 = 88 stripes. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 3. 
88 / 3 = 29.33. 

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of ingredients needed as follows:

Total number of sandwiches required = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Total number of sandwiches required = 20 / 4
Total number of sandwiches required = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:
Total pounds of meat required = Total number of sandwiches required
Total pounds of meat required = 5

Total pounds of cheese required = Total number of sandwiches required
Total pounds of cheese required = 5

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
Total cost of meat = Total pounds of meat required * Cost per pound of meat
Total cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total pounds of cheese required * Cost per pound of cheese
Total cost of cheese = 5 * $3.00
Total cost of cheese = $15.00

Total cost of ingredients = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese
Total cost of ingredients = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost of ingredients = $50.00

The final answer is: $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 (initial cannolis) + 60 (additional cannolis) = 100 cannolis

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 (total cannolis) - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 100 (cannolis) + 60 (corns)
Total = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of steps Elliott completed before his jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left from the total steps he needed to take: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

Therefore, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to the employees in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $6,000

Since the company hired 40 employees in May, the number of employees in June is 40 - 1/4 * 40 = 30 employees.

In June, the company pays each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to the employees in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $4,200

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:

$6,000 + $4,200 = $10,200

The final answer is: $10,200"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of these items is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of candles that will explode and the number of candles that will smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them explode, we can calculate this as:

Number of exploding candles = Total number of candles * Percentage of exploding candles
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Next, we need to find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate this as:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles smelling like wet dog
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

However, we need to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since these are two independent events, we can assume that the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities. 

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog = 0.05
Probability of a candle exploding = 0.05

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding = Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog * Probability of a candle exploding
= 0.05 * 0.05
= 0.0025

Now, we can find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog and exploding = Total number of candles * Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding
= 50000 * 0.0025
= 125

Therefore, 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 = 500 - (number of apples gathered from the average trees)

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as y. Since Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, we know that y > 0.

Now, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 + y = 500

Since Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, we know that y > 0. However, we cannot determine the exact value of y yet.

We can express the number of apples gathered from the average trees in terms of x:

y = 500 - 3x - 60
y = 440 - 3x

Since y > 0, we know that 440 - 3x > 0. Solving for x, we get:

3x < 440
x < 440/3
x < 146.67

Since x must be an integer (you can't gather a fraction of an apple), we know that x ≤ 146.

Now, let's try x = 146:

3x + 60 = 3(146) + 60 = 468
500 - (440 - 3x) = 500 - 440 + 3x = 60 + 3x

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now, we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Next, we need to calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days. He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days (4 days + 2 days). The total distance is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to the total.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. The total distance for the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days and the second week. The total distance is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the sizes of the lockers. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation. 

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

The difference in elevation is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: $4000 (twice as much as the first bank)
Total amount received from both banks: $4000 + $4000 = $8000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $8000 (total amount received) = $13000

So, Mr. Josue now has $13000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The final 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 6) = (1/3)x - 2. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6) = (2/3)x + 4.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from both jeans, which is equal to $6. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x = 8

However, this would mean the jogger jeans cost the same as the tattered jeans, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

Simplify the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we still need to find the value of x.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10, and the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x.

We also know that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same. Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

We can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 3x

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 6x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders:

3(x + 10) = 3(10 + 10) = 3(20) = 60

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders:

60 + 3x = 60 + 3(10) = 60 + 30 = 90

So, Lillian can expect to see 90 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to use the rest of the money to buy the ticket. 

Since the ticket costs $100, Kenny must have $100 - $50 = $50 left from selling the cards. 

We know that he sells the cards for $1.5 each and he has $50 from selling them. To find out how many cards he sold, we can divide $50 by $1.5.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Now, we know Kenny sold 33 cards. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, he must have had 33 * 3 = 99 cards initially.

The final answer is 99."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is enough for 40 guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of guests - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 40 - 36
= 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 

The total number of letters is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00, the cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00, and the cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00. 

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00. 

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

132"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the amount in each container by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we can multiply 3/4 gallon by 8 pints per gallon.

3/4 * 8 pints = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means that 380 cents is 99% of his initial amount. To find the total amount he spent, we can set up the equation:

99% of 500 = 380

To find the total amount spent, we can divide 380 by 0.99 (which is 99% in decimal form):

500 * 0.99 = 495

So, George spent 495 cents. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of a candy bar to find the number of candy bars he bought:

495 / 75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the total number of lollipops he shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom each have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, we divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions will be 4 * $2.00 = $8.00. 

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. 

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00. Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 1*20 + 2*20 = 40 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 3*20 + 4*20 = 100 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it's on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for 16 miles is: 
Total cost = 16 miles * $3/mile 
Total cost = $48 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of: 
Total money = 6 * $5 
Total money = $30 

Now, we subtract the cost of hay from the total money Michael has: 
Change = Total money - Total cost 
Change = $30 - $48 
Change = -$18 

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass requires 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses she can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to compare his final score to Marcy's final score. 

Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores 26 points, so his final score is 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points, so her final score is 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we subtract Marcy's final score from Joey's final score to find out how many points Joey is winning: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

Joey is winning by 5 points.

17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of a popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. So, the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $20 - $3 = $17.

We are also given that buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price saves $2. This means that the cost of the popcorn and the soda together is $12 + $2 = $14.

Since we know the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $17, and the total cost of the popcorn and soda together is $14, we can set up the equation:

17 = P + S

We also know that the soda costs $3, so we can substitute S = $3 into the equation:

17 = P + 3

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

P = 14

So, the regular price of a popcorn is $14.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 45. This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Now, two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to first determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards she has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

Since she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students, the number of cards given to the students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

If each student received 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to the students by 10. 

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9.

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = 100 - 180 = -80

Since Fireman Frank can't have a negative number of shoes, this means he will have 0 shoes on Sunday.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils are used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils are used. The remaining pencils are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils are left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils are left.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet. 

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the total length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long, so the percentage is (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we can multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time required to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (4 days).

First, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Now, we can divide the total time in hours by the number of days:

4 hours / 4 days = 1 hour per day

So, Jason needs to walk for 1 hour each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks."
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by the number of kids to find out how many books each child received:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting the kids who are allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

Number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel for 3 days. 

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive for a busy weekend, we need to calculate the increased price. 

20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 

So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. 

For 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400. 

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000 (since there are two people). 

The total cost of the trip is $5400 (hotel) + $10000 (plane tickets) = $15400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, for a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

Total miles run per week = miles run per day * days run per week
Total miles run per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles run per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
Total hours run per week = Total miles run per week / speed
Total hours run per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours run per week = 6 hours/week

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for five days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this demand. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of oats in each bag (50 pounds).

200 / 50 = 4

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will pay for only 1 pack. 

The total cost of 2 packs is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00. 

However, she also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost after applying the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since she is buying 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $6.00 / 8 = $0.75 per razor.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

"To determine the break-even point, we need to set up an equation for each venue and solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

To find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other and solve for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of insects each person found. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by each person is equal to 43. 

We can write the equation: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + 7 = 43

Simplify: B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: B = 36

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 36/2 = 18

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 36/2 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns $30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: $210 - $100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance is 0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km.

Since Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer, she will need 60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. 

We can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is 90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Since she sold each bag for $8, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
$64 - $32 = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total fight time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the number of cookies made by each person. 

We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 1/4 * 36 = 9 cookies.

We also know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, Kelsie made 2 * 9 = 18 cookies.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Adding 40 minutes to this = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate the total number of items she wants to make for her grandchildren. Since there are 3 grandchildren and each item is made for all of them, she needs:

- 3 hats
- 3 scarves
- 3 sweaters
- 3 pairs of mittens
- 3 pairs of socks

Now, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:

- Hats: 3 * 2 = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 * 4 = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 * 12 = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 * 1 = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 * 2 = 6 skeins

Adding up the total number of skeins needed: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63

Therefore, Martha needs 63 skeins of wool to make the winter wear for her grandchildren.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Chris starts with 100 math problems. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are 100 - 12 = 88.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. So, the remaining problems are now 88 - 36 = 52.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems. So, the remaining problems are now 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, subtract the number of loaves sold: 200 - 93 = 107
Then, add the number of loaves returned: 107 + 6 = 113

The bakery had 113 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we need to find the maximum number of rows between the two colors. In this case, the blue tulips will limit the number of rows to 3.

Jackson will plant 3 rows of flowers."
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she can use for each batch of oatmeal cookies. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, and she has 27 cups of raisins, we can divide 27 by 3/4 to find the total number of batches.

To divide 27 by 3/4, we can multiply 27 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. 

27 * (4/3) = 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins."
"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week
New weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week

Now, we can calculate the difference in weekly consumption:
98 kilowatt-hours per week - 84 kilowatt-hours per week = 14 kilowatt-hours per week

The cost of the additional kilowatt-hours per week is:
14 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $21 per week

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21 per week."

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Since we want to know how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can divide the total work (1 house) by the combined rate of 5 people:

Combined rate = 5 people * (1/5 house per day) = 1 house per day

Now, we can divide the total work (1 house) by the combined rate (1 house per day):

Time = 1 house / 1 house per day = 1 day

However, since we want to know the time in hours, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

Time (hours) = 1 day * 24 hours/day = 24 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 24 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2.

We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3 * 22 = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how much he spent on the headphone set. 

We know Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Number of CDs = Total money spent on headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there were 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked out 5 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours for all the weeks together.
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40 passengers. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to the number who got off (21), which is 21 / 3 = 7 passengers. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.

Therefore, after the second stop, there are 66 passengers riding the bus.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

The final answer is: $900"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought back by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought back by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed to make: 72
Vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you paid, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left, which is $13. So, the amount he saved is $13 * 3 = $39.

To find the total amount he has now, we need to add the amount he had left after spending $8 to the amount he saved. So, $13 + $39 = $52.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the $20 she gave.

The total cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
The total cost of the peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of all the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. The total amount they have together is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

4x = 4 * 20
4x = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his workplace. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

So, in total, 3 (initial) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many candles James needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son will need 8 candles.

The total number of candles James needs is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost will be 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes she spent reading (105) by 1.5 minutes per page, and then multiply by 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can add the pages she read in the first week (140) to the pages she read in the second week (100).

140 + 100 = 240 pages

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received half of that amount for each of the last two teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent on wooden action figures from his initial amount of $70 to find out how much he has left: $70 - $20 = $50.

Since he spent $6 on plastic action figures, he has $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Now, we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he bought: $44 / $2 = 22.

To find the total number of action figures, we add the number of wooden action figures (4) to the number of plastic action figures (22): 4 + 22 = 26.

Therefore, Peter will have 26 action figures by the end of the week.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops and then subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

Total roses required by the shops per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses
Total roses required by the shops in a month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he grows in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4.

Total roses grown by Ford in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

Now, let's calculate how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.

Roses lacking = Total roses required by the shops in a month - Total roses grown by Ford in a month
Roses lacking = 260 roses - 160 roses
Roses lacking = 100 roses

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account over that period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in a year as follows:

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since we want to find out the amount remaining after 2 years, we multiply the annual removal amount by 2:

$1200/year * 2 years = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to first determine the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = (Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves) + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Total cost = ($3.00 * 10) + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00

The final answer is: $10.00"
"To determine how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Since each muffin requires 8 crayons, the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, to find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the selling price of each muffin crayon: 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) = $10512.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

Let's break down the number of birds Mack saw each day:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds seen = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds seen per day = Total number of birds seen / Number of days
= 330 / 7
= 47.14 (rounded to two decimal places)

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is approximately 47.14."

"To find the total number of cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, they have 7 cards together.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the actual temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the actual temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 468 * 1.04 = 485.12.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 485 degrees. 

485"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by adding 30 minutes to 60 minutes, resulting in 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert the 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, which equals 120 minutes. Then, we add the 5 minutes to get a total of 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) to the time of the second movie (125 minutes) to get the total time: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add their values together: 
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since the question asks for the total number of utensils, we need to add the number of cups and dishes. The total number of utensils is 12 (cups) + 68 (dishes) = 80.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, the number of days one pair of contacts will last is:
45 days / 90 contacts = 0.5 days per pair

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 0.5 days per pair = $360.00 per pair

The final answer is: $360.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from both activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends. So, the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This means 8 more people will be attending.

Now, we add the initial number of people invited by Alex (100), the additional guests they will bring (200), and the additional guests their friends will bring (8), and the additional guests their friends' spouses will bring (8).

Total number of people attending = 100 + 200 + 8 + 8 = 316

"To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay would be $4 * 2 = $8.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay by adding the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $16 (Amazon) = $5.

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the point at which the beanstalk's height exceeds Mark's window height. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since it doubles every day, we can calculate its height on each subsequent day:

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Since 64 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the daily protein intake as follows:

200 grams (mushrooms per day) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days (per week) = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is 3x.

We can set up an equation to represent the sum of the angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve buys each year and add the 5 games he receives as a gift.

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, which is 12 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 12 + 5 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 24 + 5 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 48 + 5 = 53 games.

Now, we need to add the total number of games Steve has at the end of each year to find the total number of games he has after 3 years.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, if they worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz would make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa would make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year and then divide that by the number of rotations it can withstand.

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations per year:

Number of rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile
Total rotations per year = 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations per year

Now, let's calculate the number of years the tire can withstand:

Total rotations the tire can withstand = 10,440,000 rotations
Number of rotations per year = 145,000 rotations/year

Number of years the tire can withstand = Total rotations the tire can withstand / Number of rotations per year
= 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/year
= 72 years

The tire will need to be replaced in 72 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before tax and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:
- Shirt: $25
- Shorts: $35
Total cost before tax: $25 + $35 = $60

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before tax - Discount amount
= $60 - $18
= $42

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost after discount. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8%:
Sales tax = 8% of $42 = 0.08 * $42 = $3.36

Now, let's calculate the total cost including tax:
Total cost including tax = Total cost after discount + Sales tax
= $42 + $3.36
= $45.36

Finally, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost including tax

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days, we can multiply the number of croissants per day by the number of days.

4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of croissants to pounds of butter needed.

28 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound per dozen = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

For the next 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the second month is $100,000 * 1.5, for the third month it's $100,000 * 1.5 * 1.5, and so on.

The funding for the second month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
The funding for the third month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
The funding for the fourth month is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
The funding for the fifth month is $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250

The total cost for the next 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $765,375 = $2,343,125

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the costs for the two phases:
$500,000 + $2,343,125 = $2,843,125

The final answer is: $2,843,125"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player consumed.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips consumed is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider that March has 31 days. 

Since each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the number of members by the number of days in March and then by the average number of posts per day.

Total posts in March = Number of members * Number of days in March * Average posts per day
Total posts in March = 1000 * 31 * 3
Total posts in March = 93,000

The final answer is 93,000."
"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total amount of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water used in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the aquarium is $10.00.
The cost of 2 bags of rocks is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The cost of 3 pieces of coral is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The cost of 20 fish is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its total height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. So, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg/day.

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat: 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we first need to calculate the total number of seats. 

There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. 
Total seats = 4 * 18 = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. 
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4) = 18

Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators
= 72 - 18
= 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
Seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3) = 18

Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents
= 54 - 18
= 36

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones from the total number of street lights: 16 - 20 = -4. 

Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning street lights, this indicates that the initial assumption of 20 non-functioning street lights is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 20 street lights are not functioning, it means that 20 street lights are not working. This could be due to various reasons such as maintenance, replacement, or damage. 

Assuming that the remaining street lights are functioning, we can calculate the number of functioning street lights as follows: 

Total number of street lights = 16
Number of non-functioning street lights = 20

Number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
= 16 - 20
= -4

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Next, we add the 1 piece he chews on the way home from school and the 1 piece he chews after dinner, which gives us a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Now, we need to subtract the 6 pieces of gum Jim chews from the initial 20 pieces. 20 - 6 = 14.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches). 

First, convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders by 0.25. 

Number of riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the number of riders who can stay upright by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. We subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Number of men who can stay upright = 25 - 15 = 10

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so S = 16.

We also know that he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Lastly, we know that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to consider the direction of the relative speed. In this case, we'll assume that Tom is driving in the opposite direction of Bob. So, we'll take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of fish caught by each person. 

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then find out how many classes he can afford to miss before exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since there are 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6.

If Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. The total cost of the classes he attends will be 10 - x. The cost per class will be ($60 - (10 - x)) / (10 - x).

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the cost per class is less than or equal to $10.

($60 - (10 - x)) / (10 - x) ≤ 10

Simplifying the equation:

(50 + x) / (10 - x) ≤ 10

Cross-multiplying:

50 + x ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right side:

50 + x ≤ 100 - 10x

Adding 10x to both sides:

50 + 11x ≤ 100

Subtracting 50 from both sides:

11x ≤ 50

Dividing both sides by 11:

x ≤ 50/11

x ≤ 4.55

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total weekly production, we first need to find out how many customers each person processes in a day. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed by both in a day is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To calculate the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500, so the total cost so far is $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Adding this to the total cost, we get $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. Adding this to the total cost, we get $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500. Adding this to the total cost, we get $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

43,500"
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, we need to calculate his new monthly salary including the bonus: 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: 372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500

The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website separately and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites to get the overall total:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time.

Total Time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total Time = 10 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. 

There are 3 people: Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates. 

So, the total number of people is 3 + 25 = 28.

Since Howie wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total cupcakes = 28 * 2 = 56

Therefore, Howie should buy 56 cupcakes.

56"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means the total likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140,000.

However, this is the total likes after three weeks, not the current total likes. To find the current total likes, we need to add the 20000 new likes that she received recently. 

So, the current total likes is 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000.

The final answer is: 160,000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost for her was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for her was 20 * $30 * (1 - 0.10) = 20 * $30 * 0.90 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the sales of green hats in the first month. 

Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red hat sales = 1/2 * Green hat sales
400 = 1/2 * Green hat sales
Green hat sales = 400 * 2
Green hat sales = 800

Now, we know that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales of the first month = Red hat sales + Green hat sales
Total sales of the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales of the first month = 1200

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales of the first month
Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the hours into paid and unpaid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the next two hours is 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three paid hours: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage. 

First, let's calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount in her bank account: 
$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank balance) = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that more money was taken out of her account than she should have received. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the current balance from the expected wage. 

$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank balance) = $120

So, $120 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the monthly rent and the monthly fuel cost: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year, we get: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the equation:

4s + 2g = 70 (total legs)
s + g = 20 (total heads)

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:

4s + 2g = 70
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':

(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5, which is $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of days that were either good or bad. We know that Christina had 12 good days and 8 bad days, so the number of neutral days is 30 - (12 + 8) = 10.

We also know that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days accounted for 8 good days and 8 bad days, leaving 10 neutral days.

Now, we are told that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that the total number of good days is 12 + 3 = 15.

Since the first 24 days accounted for 8 good days, the remaining good days are 15 - 8 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the target height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 600 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

600 inches / 12 = 50 feet

Now, we know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 50 feet, we can divide the target height in feet by the growth rate in inches per day.

50 feet / 30 inches/day = 50 / 30 days

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.

50 / 10 = 5
30 / 10 = 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since he already had 12 toys, he needed 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

But when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 21 toys.

So, James initially needed 12 toys, then 12 more, and now he needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of this amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = $720.

Frances then invested 2/3 of this remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = $480.

The amount left for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = $240.

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have in total. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day and then by the number of days.

$20 per hour * 3 hours per day = $60 per day
$60 per day * 2 days = $120

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 individuals, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The group of 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, and then determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster and Summer have.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 68 + 5 = 73.

Max has 73 cookies, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

The Cookie Monster's cookies are not directly related to the other characters, but we can infer that the question is asking for the total number of cookies the other three have. 

To find the total number of cookies, we add the cookies of Katarina, Max, and Summer: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20 
1.5x = 120 
x = 120 / 1.5 
x = 80 

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

Let's denote the time it takes to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as T and in ""rabbit"" mode as R. We are given that T = 1 hour = 60 minutes and R = 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)T + (1/2)R = Total time

Substituting the given values, we get:

(1/2)(60) + (1/2)(40) = Total time
30 + 20 = Total time
50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have spent so far and subtract it from the total time available.

They have spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Total time spent so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time available = 30 minutes

Time left = Time available - Total time spent so far
Time left = 30 - 19
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

The total age of the twins and triplets would be the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplets. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total age would be 2x + 3(x + 7).

We are given that the combined ages are 44. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3(x + 7) = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2x + 3x + 21 = 44.

Combining like terms, we get: 5x + 21 = 44.

Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get: 5x = 23.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get: x = 4.6.

Since 'x' represents the age of the younger twin, the age of one of the twins is 4.6 years.

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time before dinner: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies separately.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The final answer is: $36.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person saves per month and then multiply it by 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each person saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins in 10 years.

Neil saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

We also know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

We are told there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of square feet is 68."
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since Mia already has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, the total number of chairs she has is 40 + 8 = 48.

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of people:

Number of chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs
= 57 - 48
= 9

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks. 

First, we find the total number of bucks: 50 * 0.5 = 25 bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the total number of bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to calculate the total number of people and the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, we can calculate the number of seats as follows:

Number of seats = Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks per seat is 2 + 3 = 5.

Now, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed:

Total number of drinks = Number of seats * 2 = 20 * 2 = 40
Total number of snacks = Number of seats * 3 = 20 * 3 = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = (Total number of drinks * 2) + (Total number of snacks * 2)
Total cost = (40 * 2) + (60 * 2)
Total cost = 80 + 120
Total cost = 200

The group has spent $200 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Since the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds, Gary's truck must be able to carry 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2,800."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. Therefore, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying his parts by the total amount of money: 3 * $100 = $300.

However, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract this amount from his share: $300 - $10 = $290.

Therefore, Gerald had $290 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. 
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Hourly rate = Amount already raised / Number of hours already worked
= $2100 / 3
= $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours needed = Amount still needed / Hourly rate
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

First, we need to convert 40% to a decimal: 40% = 0.4

Then, we subtract 80% (or 0.8) from 0.4:
0.4 - 0.8 = -0.4

However, since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to convert the result back to a percentage. To do this, we multiply by 100:
-0.4 * 100 = -40%

Since we cannot have a negative percentage, this means that the city actually uses more water for industrial purposes than it uses for non-industrial purposes. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our calculation.

The final answer is: $168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes ice cream. 

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so its rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so its rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the factory makes two types of ice cream, we need to find the combined rate. However, we cannot simply add the rates because the factory is not making both types of ice cream simultaneously. 

Let's assume the factory makes x quarts of chocolate ice cream and (100 - x) quarts of vanilla ice cream in 2 hours. We can set up the equation:

x / 2 + (100 - x) / 4 = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + (100 - x) = 200
x + 100 = 200
x = 100

So, the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. 

Now, we can find the combined rate:

Combined rate = 100 quarts / 2 hours + 50 quarts / 4 hours
= 50 quarts per hour + 12.5 quarts per hour
= 62.5 quarts per hour

Now, we can find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Total quarts = 62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours
= 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can afford. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 14 days. 

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. 

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy have 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, but it increased by 10%. 

To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.10 (which is equivalent to 100% + 10%).
New price = $700 * 1.10 = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.
Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each weighing 2 oz. Since eggs are 75 calories per ounce, the total calories from the eggs would be 6 * 2 * 75 = 900 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, which is 120 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the cheese would be 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, which is 40 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the ham would be 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together: 900 + 240 + 80 = 1220 calories.

The total calories in the omelet are 1220.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 100 people apply for the job, and 30% receive interviews. 

Number of people who receive interviews = 100 * 0.3 = 30

Next, we know that 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer.

Number of people who receive a job offer = 30 * 0.2 = 6

Finally, we know that a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position.

Number of people who accept the position = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Therefore, 2 people accept the position.

"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave away, we need to calculate the number of sacks she gave to her cousin and brother, then multiply that by the weight of each sack.

Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes, considering the time her arms were raised and the time they were not.

First, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised. Since her arms were raised for 2 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes, resulting in 2 * 200 = 400 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were not raised. Since her arms were not raised for 3 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes, resulting in 3 * 300 = 900 taps.

Now, we can find the total number of taps she made with her feet by adding the taps made when her arms were raised and when they were not raised. 

Total taps = 400 (with arms raised) + 900 (with arms not raised) = 1300 taps.

The final answer is: 1300"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have received from the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by doing something that would cause damage, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is -195."

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 people, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by all the friends: 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat, which is 9, and it takes 2/3 the time the cat takes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time taken by both and divide by 2:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

The average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches to get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100. 

Now, we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

This means 2000 people voted by midday, leaving 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people who had not voted.

Next, we are told that by 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. We can calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 as follows:

2/3 * 3000 = 2000

This means 2000 people voted by 16:00, leaving 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people who had not voted.

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, in 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since each pack has 15 pieces of gum, we can divide the total number of pieces Parker will chew (120) by the number of pieces per pack (15) to find out how many packs he needs:

120 / 15 = 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:

Since candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, candidate B received 20 + (0.50 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. The sum of the votes received by candidate A and candidate B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

To find the number of votes candidate C received, we subtract the total votes received by candidate A and B from the total number of voters: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck had initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, let's calculate the number of apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples:

Beck's apples after giving 10 = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's apples after giving 10 = 77 + 10
Beck's apples after giving 10 = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract Beck's apples after giving 10 from Boris's remaining apples:

Difference = Boris's remaining apples - Beck's apples after giving 10
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation 2x = 20, where x is the number of books Steven has. 

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10. 

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can subtract $2 from the cost of the gallon jar to find the cost of the half-gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount of money spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money spent = $50 + $48
Total amount of money spent = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

"To calculate Mark's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he received.

Total cost of packs: 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Total value of the cards: 
- The card worth $4000
- The card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total value of the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total value to find the profit:
Profit = Total value of the cards - Total cost of packs
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together. 

For the first amusement park, the cost for the adults is 2 * $26 = $52. 
The cost for the children is 2 * $12 = $24. 
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for the adults is 2 * $14 = $28. 
The cost for the children is 2 * $10 = $20. 
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

The family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, Carl has as C, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S = 4 * 56 = 224.

Additionally, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = L/2. Since S = 56, we can find L by multiplying both sides by 2, giving us L = 2S = 2 * 56 = 112.

Now that we know the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. This is simply C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group

However, since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

To find the total number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

54 students / 4.5 students per group = 12 groups

Since we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to accommodate the remaining students. 

There are 0 students left to be accommodated, as 54 students can be evenly divided into 12 groups."
"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of bananas over time.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

Annual cost = $100 * 12 = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the annual cost by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Monthly cost per roommate = $1200 / 4 = $300

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."

Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from this trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of the second house, so if we let x be the number of cases needed for the second house, the first house needs x/2 cases.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house = 2 * (100) = 200

The third house needs 200 cases of shingles.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
5 hours * $15 per hour = $75
Total earnings for Monday = $60 + $75 = $135

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
2 hours * $15 per hour = $30
Total earnings for Wednesday = $30 + $30 = $60

Now, we need to add the earnings from both days to get the total:
Total earnings = $135 + $60 = $195

Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus for Monday. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the daily bonus.

Total earnings = $195 + $5 = $200

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet earns from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to earn $75 from selling corn. He has 25 ears of corn, so we need to divide the amount he needs to earn from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25) to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for.

"To find the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine how many hours she spends playing soccer. 

She reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. The remaining time after reading is 7 - 3 = 4 hours. 

Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, she spends 1/3 * 4 = 4/3 hours playing video games. 

The total time spent on reading and video games is 3 + 4/3 = 13/3 hours. 

The time spent playing soccer is 7 - 13/3 = 7 - 4.33 = 2.67 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time of the weekend and multiply by 100.

Now, we know that Mike can get these series for $6 each. So, the cost of the series is:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost per series
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, we know that 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, the number of older movies is:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies, which are not in series and not older movies. These are the movies that are neither in series nor older movies. Since we already know the number of older movies, we can find the number of remaining movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series - Number of older movies
= 600 - 200 - 160
= 240

The cost of the remaining movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = Number of remaining movies * Cost per normal movie
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which the family hiked. 

The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance they covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance they covered is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 

The distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles. 

The total distance is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's score:
- She collects 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 40 + 900 = 1020.

The difference between their scores is 1020 - 820 = 200.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars. 

64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 / 2 = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times per day * 5 days = 15 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 times per day = 6 times per day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish after buying more is 3 + x.

The total number of fish after buying more is 7 (initial fish) + x (newly bought fish). Since the total number of fish is the sum of white and orange fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x + 4 + x = 7 + x

Combine like terms:

7 + 2x = 7 + x

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = x

Subtract x from both sides:

x = 0

This means Bob bought 0 white fish. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Bob would not buy 0 white fish. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

3 + x + 4 + x = 3 + 2x

Combine like terms:

7 + 2x = 3 + 2x

Subtract 3 from both sides:

4 + 2x = 2x

Subtract 2x from both sides:

4 = 0

This is still not possible, as 4 cannot equal 0. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct equation should be:

3 + x + 4 + x = 2(3 + x)

Combine like terms:

7 + 2x = 6 + 2x

Subtract 2x from both sides:

7 = 6

This is still not possible, as 7 cannot equal 6. However, let's re-evaluate the problem again.

The correct equation should be:

3 + x + 4 + x = 2(4)

Combine like terms:

7 + 2x = 8

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 1

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 0.5

Since we can't buy half a fish, this solution doesn't make sense. However, let's re-evaluate the problem again.

The correct equation should be:

3 + x + 4 + x = 2(3 + 4)

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption, we need to calculate the daily fuel consumption and then multiply it by 5 (the number of working days).

First, we need to calculate the daily fuel consumption. Since the one-way distance is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total working days in a week is 5 days.

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * Number of working days
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 quarters by $0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 twenties by $20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = $200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find the amount she spent, we multiply 3/5 by $200.

3/5 * 200 = 3 * 40 = $120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount she had from the twenties to find the remaining amount.

$200 - $120 = $80

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the remaining amount from the twenties to find the total amount she paid for lunch.

$35 + $80 = $115

The total amount Carrie paid for lunch is $115."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is heated enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = Number of male lions + Number of female lions + Number of lion cubs
= 6 + 12 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to all employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000 per month.

To find the total amount paid over three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The final answer is: $3,120,000."
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so singing it twice will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so singing it once will take 240 seconds.

The total caroling time is 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 
Total score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 14 days. So, she plays 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relative motion of the two cars. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can calculate the relative speed between them. 

Relative speed = Speed of the second car - Speed of the first car
Relative speed = 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph

Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds. 

Now, we need to find the distance that will separate them after 2 hours. 

Distance = Relative speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost James paid is the cost of the diamond and gold plus the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To determine the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag of chips. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and then add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 (consumed) + 10 (left) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200). 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students on campus by the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- Beginning of the year: 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students by the end of May, we subtract the initial number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of branches Felix climbed. Since he made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches.

Total amount made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25
Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each set of flowers and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals from each set: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, she lost 1 * (3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 18 petals. 

Now, subtract the lost petals from the total: 101 - 18 = 83 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 83."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and subtract that from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using 18 marshmallows, they had 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they had 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 

14 / 2 = 7

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The friend who is significantly better played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, resulting in 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8Z + G = 10.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amount of salt, oil, and citrus zest together is 2Z + 4Z + Z = 7Z. This means that the amount of sugar is 10 - 7Z = 3Z.

Substituting G = 3Z into the equation 8Z + G = 10, we get 8Z + 3Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 11Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 11, we get Z = 10/11.

Now that we know Z, we can find O by substituting Z into the equation O = 4Z, resulting in O = 4(10/11) = 40/11.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 40 by 11, which equals approximately 3.636.

The final answer is: 3.636"

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find out how many hours she walked on the second day. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the hours walked on the second day as follows:

Hours walked on the first day = 8 hours
Hours walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can find the total hours walked in the two days by adding the hours walked on both days:

Total hours = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at the beginning of the lunch break: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

Since John does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is 150 * 7 = 1050 tasks.

Each task pays $1.20, so his total earnings for the week would be 1050 * $1.20 = $1260.

"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find Sasha's total points by adding the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find the difference, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 - 36 = 52

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the cost of shipping the book is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book 20 miles. The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the cost of shipping the book 20 miles is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total cost of shipping the book is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive. The book costs $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund will be 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since Milly will have to pay $3.00 for shipping, she will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$21.00.

However, since Milly is losing money, we can say she will lose $21.00.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the jeans to the initial amount, we get $140 + $60 = $200.

Finally, she buys a bag for $20, so the total amount she spent is $200 + $20 = $220.

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $140 - $220 = -$80.

Since Mulan can't have a negative amount of money, this means she actually spent more than she had, and she is now $80 short of the initial amount."
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on writing songs: 
18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent writing songs in a month is: 
72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on doing her makeup: 
15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent doing makeup in a month is: 
90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent on writing songs and doing makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month: 
288 minutes + 360 minutes = 648 minutes

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The standard installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, so we need to calculate the cost for the additional 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

The standard installation also includes 10 pictures, but Angela has 20 pictures, so we need to calculate the cost for the additional 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The standard installation also includes 1 chandelier, but Angela has 2 chandeliers, so we need to calculate the cost for the additional 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

The total cost of the standard installation is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $150.00 + $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard installation and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Eva's savings. Since Eva has saved $20.00, and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings by adding 40% of Anthony's savings to Anthony's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, we can calculate the speed of each turtle as follows:

Speed of each turtle = Combined speed / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Speed of each turtle
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many clay dishes each person made. 

We know Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes they all made together: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call this amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the job pay, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 (the price of the laptop after trading in her old one) plus $50 (the remaining amount she needs): x + $150 + $80 = $400 + $50.

Now, let's simplify the equation: x + $230 = $450.

To find the value of x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: x = $450 - $230.

x = $220.

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam initially had and then subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
So, the total number of apple slices Adam initially had is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to increase the total amount of milk by 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to have 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts of all three glue sticks: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total amount spent on squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total amount spent on water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. We can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 0.5.

60 * 0.5 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes.

Total = 240 socks + 60 dishes + 30 dishes
Total = 240 + 90
Total = 330

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can multiply the number of trays by the selling price to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the eggs."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90 rooms. 

Half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the previous two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"To solve this problem, let's assign variables to each person's age. Let's say your brother's age is B, your sister's age is S, and your age is A.

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. A = B - 3 (since you are 3 years younger than your brother)
2. A = S + 2 (since you are 2 years older than your sister)
3. 3B - 1 = A (since your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3 to get:
3B - 1 = B - 3
2B = 4
B = 2

Now that we know your brother's age, we can find your age using equation 1:
A = B - 3
A = 2 - 3
A = -1

However, age cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. Let's re-evaluate the equations.

We can substitute equation 2 into equation 3 to get:
3B - 1 = S + 2
3B - 3 = S

Now, we can substitute equation 1 into equation 3:
3B - 3 = S
3B - 3 = B - 3
2B = 0
B = 0

This solution is also not valid since age cannot be 0.

Let's try another approach. We can add the three equations together:

3A + S = 91

We can substitute equation 1 into this equation:
3(A - 3) + S = 91
3A - 9 + S = 91
3A + S = 100

Now we have two equations:
2A + B + S = 87
3A + S = 100

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(3A + S) - (2A + B + S) = 100 - 87
A - B = 13

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the amount of water passing through the river doubles every day. 

On the first day, the river receives 4000 gallons of water. 
On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.

The problem states that the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day. However, this information is not necessary to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point. The correct total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 16000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20: 10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2.

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total: $20 - $2 = $18.

Now, we add the amount Julieta received to Rafaela's amount: $18 + $20 = $38.

The total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela is $38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices baked and sold. 

Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, in one hour, she bakes 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

Since she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours, she baked a total of 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

We also know that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the sum of the other colors from the total number of cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 5 phones * $700 = $3500.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we find 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be 16 * $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.

David has $12 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate of pay. 

First, we divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3 hours). 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she will work (12 hours). 

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we need to first calculate the total revenue he will generate from selling 3/5 of his chickens at $50 per chicken.

Total chickens = 300
Chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens
Revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total revenue - Desired profit
Total cost = $9000 - $2000
Total cost = $7000

Now, to find the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we need to divide the total cost by the number of chickens he sold.

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Chickens sold
Cost per chicken = $7000 / 180 chickens
Cost per chicken = $38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys (Micah and Mitchell) by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

32 glasses / 2 = 16 glasses per boy

"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to sell the rope to her for $2 per meter. Since the rope is 20 meters long, the total amount she will receive from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will receive from selling the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. Let's denote this number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10, a packet of chicken costs $20. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91. Since the result is negative, Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, and there are 6 birds in the bushes, we can calculate this as:

2/3 * 6 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, let's calculate the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so:

3 * 8 = 24 birds feeding

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding:

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. This includes the cost of 2 carrots, 1 salad, and 1 yogurt. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

where x is the cost of one carrot.

Now, we can solve for x:

2x + 9 = 11
2x = 2
x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to first calculate his new hourly wage. 

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = (new hourly wage) * (hours worked per day) * (days worked per week)
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. 

So, 6x + (amount from lemonade sales) = 80

We don't know the amount from lemonade sales yet, but we can express it as 'y'. 

6x + y = 80

We also know that the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 8x. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn is x. 

The ratio of the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn to the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn is 3:1. 

The ratio of the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn to the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn is 5:1. 

The total ratio of the number of times she mowed lawns is 3 + 5 + x = 8x. 

Since the total number of times she mowed lawns is 8x, the ratio of the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn to the total number of times she mowed lawns is 3/8. 

The ratio of the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn to the total number of times she mowed lawns is 5/8. 

The ratio of the amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn to the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 3/8. 

The ratio of the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn to the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 5/8. 

The ratio of the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn to the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 1/8. 

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6/8 of the total amount she made from mowing lawns. 

The amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6/8 * 6x = 9x/2.

The amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3/8 * 6x = 9x/4.

The amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5/8 * 6x = 15x/4.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x/2 + 9x/4 + 15x/4 = 9x/2 + 24x/4 = 9x/2 + 6x = 15x/2.

Now we can equate this to 80 - y:

15x/2 = 80 - y

We also know that 6x + y = 80.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

15x = 160 - 2y

Now, multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

12x + 2y = 160

Now, multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 15 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:

30x = 320 - 4y

90x + 30y = 2400

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate y:

(90x + 30y) - (30x + 4y) = 2400 - 320

60x + 26y = 2080

Now, multiply the first equation by 26 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:

1560x + 52y = 4160

60x + 26y = 2080

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:

(1560x + 52y) - (60x + 26y) = 4160 - 2080

1500x + 26y = 2080

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:

(1500x + 26y) - (60x + 26y) = 2080 - 2080

1440x = 0

Now, divide both sides by 1440:

x = 0

Since x = 0, Tasha didn't mow any lawns. 

This means she made all her money from lemonade sales. 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 0 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total monthly hours are 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation to find Joseph's initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Joseph's initial number of notebooks as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation:

3x = 7

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So, Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks (as you can't have a fraction of a notebook).

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 - 2 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pages Denise read today and compare it to the number of pages Daniel read yesterday.

Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages. Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages yesterday.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 pages. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. Denise read 18 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so the total number of pages Denise read is 18 + 18 = 36 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. To find the difference, we subtract 13 from 36: 36 - 13 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the soup is enough for 8 child's bowls.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

6 / 2 = 3

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material per mask. To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material per mask. To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets Deepa has bought. Since she has seen each movie three times, the total number of tickets is 9 movies * 3 tickets/movie = 27 tickets.

Now, we can divide the total amount she spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a day, he sleeps for 10 hours * 7 days = 70 hours.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.

He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on these activities is 70 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 79 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day. So, Harold's free time is 24 - 79 = -55 hours. However, since we can't have negative hours, this means Harold doesn't have any free time left in his day.

Final answer: 0"
"To find out how many red and blue shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the total number of each type of shoe box.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Total blue shoe boxes = 7
Used blue shoe boxes = 3
Remaining blue shoe boxes = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Total red shoe boxes = 9
Used red shoe boxes = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Remaining red shoe boxes = 9 - 3 = 6

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, which is 1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total number of marbles Dean initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of each farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so we multiply 200 by 2 and add 100: 
200 * 2 = 400
400 + 100 = 500

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together: 
200 + 500 = 700

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To determine Colby's earnings, we need to first calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his total earnings in a typical 8-hour workday would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of red and yellow balloons. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. 

So, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. 

Number of yellow balloons = 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a 30-day month. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by the girls and then divide it by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since the girls combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is equal to the total cost of the items purchased, which is $28. To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we need to divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold, then the total cost of the lollipops, and finally subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cups of tea that Lana brews in each row. Since she has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. 

The number of cups for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana divides these 12 cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea, we can divide 12 by 3 to find the number of cups in each row.

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up), we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours by dividing 8 by 4. 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. The total amount spent on snacks is $8 + $16 = $24.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. After spending $24 on snacks, he has $150 - $24 = $126 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday. Since he already saw 5 movies on a Friday, he can't see another one on this Friday. However, he can see a movie on a Saturday. 

Colby has $126 left, and tickets for Saturdays cost $10. He can buy 126 / 10 = 12.6 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 12 tickets on a Saturday.

Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies on a Saturday.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from all pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying this, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 x 2 = 8. Maria also had 2 balloons. 

So, the total number of balloons initially is 8 (friends) + 2 (Maria) = 10.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 10 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 25.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To determine the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated and the existing boxes.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes

Total boxes: 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat and then find the average.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average, we add the total distances and divide by 2:
Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
Average total distance = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance = 820 / 2
Average total distance = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

Therefore, Fern will make $67,200 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the 24-hour stay.

For the 12-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since he wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he would stay for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The additional 5 hours would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

For the 24-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1600 pesos for the entire 24 hours.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total amount John spends on gas and pencils: 
50 dollars (gas) + 5 * 10 dollars (pencils) = 50 + 50 = 100 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the amount John has left after buying gas and pencils: 
300 dollars - 100 dollars = 200 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining amount: 
200 dollars / 25 dollars = 8 pens.

The number of pens John can buy is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, and Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we can calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters per word = 300 letters

Craig's brother's total letters = Craig's total letters + 50 = 300 + 50 = 350 letters

Now, to find the total number of letters they've spelled after the ten rounds, we need to add Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.

Total letters = Craig's total letters + Craig's brother's total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows. 

Number of children in each row = 8
Number of rows = 7

The total number of children that can be in the drill is 56."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has. Since the teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has is 9 * 100 = 900.

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles the teacher had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

The final answer is: 842"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into labor and parts.

Labor cost: 
- The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour, or part thereof. 
- Since 2.25 hours is more than 2 hours, we round up to 3 hours for simplicity. 
- Labor cost = 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105

Parts cost: 
- The job used $60 in parts.

Total cost = Labor cost + Parts cost
- Total cost = $105 + $60
- Total cost = $165

Patty charged $165 for the job."
"To find out how much James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs and then subtract the amount he received from selling 5 of them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs:
10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount:
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

So, the total cost of the CDs after the discount is:
$150 - $60 = $90

Now, let's calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the amount he received from the total cost:
$90 - $200 = -$110

Since James is out of money, the answer is -$110."
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams, she has 6 and each costs $1.5, so the total revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and each costs $2, so the total revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and each costs $1.25, so the total revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the root crops together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after the events described.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper and then multiply it by the respective commission rates.

For the New York Times:
6 copies sold * $5 per copy = $30
Commission on the New York Times = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

For the Wall Street Journal:
10 copies sold * $15 per copy = $150
Commission on the Wall Street Journal = 8% of $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission = Commission on the New York Times + Commission on the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between Marcus, Leo, and Deanna's ages.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent Marcus's age as x and Leo's age as 2x. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can write the equation:

x = 26 - 5
x = 21

Now that we know Marcus's age, we can find Leo's age by multiplying x by 2:

Leo's age = 2x
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Azibo scored x points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three team members is 45. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 30 reports.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the total time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time.

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

However, she also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add this time to the total sleep time.

475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 498 minutes that day."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he initially has is:

2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he still has 24 measuring cups.

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 measuring cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds and the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied. 

Initial number of occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days

Total increase in occupied beds = 50 * 14 = 700 beds

New total number of occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

The final answer is 45."

"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to establish a relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey picked up as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason picked up 2x balls. 

Given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan picked up 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

Since the total number of balls is the sum of the balls picked up by each boy, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = total number of balls

Combine like terms:

7x = total number of balls

We are also given that Jason picked up 2 balls. Since Jason picked up 2x balls, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of balls:

7x = 7 * 1 = 7

The total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We know that they dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes in the first three days. Since the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net displacement. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net displacement is the sum of the distances traveled south:
Net Displacement = 300 + 110 = 410 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 410 miles.

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member and then add them together.

Nani is 8 years old.

Since Nani's brother is twice his age, his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we calculate 75% of 8, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she had initially is 12 * 20 = 240.

Then, she gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. So, the total number of oranges she gave away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away from the total number of oranges she initially had: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'x'. 
Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know that Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 30 - 10 
x = 20 

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard together have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 
To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries: 
60 - 50 = 10 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 
30 - 10 = 20 

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the respective cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: (10 * $6) + (11 * $15) = $60 + $165 = $225
- Sunday: (15 * $6) + (15 * $15) = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total amount of time she will be outside. 

She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days. 
Total time outside = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen. 

32 / 8 = 4

She will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 48, and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of football players and the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Number of football players = 20% of 30 students
= 0.20 * 30
= 6 students

Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band = 25% of the remaining students (excluding football players)
= 25% of (30 - 6)
= 25% of 24
= 0.25 * 24
= 6 students

Total number of students leaving early = Number of football players + Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band
= 6 + 6
= 12 students

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size, we add the sizes of both pairs and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total space required for the flowers and the space left between them. 

Since Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, we need to convert this to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each flower. This means that the total space required for each flower and the space between it and the next flower is 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. We'll divide the total space (1332 inches) by the space required for each flower and the space between them (18 inches). 

1332 / 18 = 74.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 74 flowers. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate his brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To determine how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside for shoes each month and then divide that amount by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica sets aside 25% of her monthly income, which is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500. 

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she sets aside $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of a single pair of shoes: $6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook one shrimp. 

She can peel 6 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to peel one shrimp, we divide 10 minutes by 6 shrimp: 10 minutes / 6 shrimp = 1.67 minutes per shrimp.

Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes to sauté one shrimp by dividing 10 minutes by 30 shrimp: 10 minutes / 30 shrimp = 0.33 minutes per shrimp.

However, the problem asks for the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp. Since peeling and cooking are two separate tasks, we can assume that the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp is the sum of the time it takes to peel one shrimp and the time it takes to cook one shrimp. 

So, the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp is 1.67 minutes + 0.33 minutes = 2 minutes.

Now, we can find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by multiplying the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp by 90: 2 minutes * 90 = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 180 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effect on high and the cooling effect on low:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

The final temperature is the initial temperature minus the net cooling effect plus the warming effect:
Final temperature = Initial temperature - net cooling effect + warming effect
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 6 degrees + 4 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 2 degrees

Since we don't know the initial temperature, we can represent the final temperature as 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes each month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks per month:
1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month

Since there are 4 quarters in a year, the total number of checks for the pest and lawn service is 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks per month and the total number of checks for the pest and lawn service:
4 (checks per month) * 12 (months per year) = 48 checks per year
4 (checks per year for pest and lawn service) + 48 (checks per year for other bills) = 52 checks per year

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane must make 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the average age of the group as 'A'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express her age as 2A.

2. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years, respectively. 

3. We can express the total age of the group as the sum of the ages of the four children: 3 + 4 + 2A + x = 20, where 'x' represents the age of Wilfred.

4. Since there are four children, we can express the average age 'A' as the total age divided by 4: A = (3 + 4 + 2A + x) / 4.

5. We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: 4A = 3 + 4 + 2A + x.

6. Simplifying the equation further, we get 4A = 7 + 2A + x.

7. Subtracting 2A from both sides, we get 2A = 7 + x.

8. Since we know that Helene's age is twice the average age, we can express her age as 2A. We also know that the total age of the group is 20, so we can express the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene as 3 + 4 + 2A = 7 + 2A.

9. Subtracting 2A from both sides, we get 7 = x.

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 7 years.

"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, and everyone else has contributed $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 15 * 100 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices for the adults is 4. 

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of slices for adults / total number of slices) * 100
= (4 / 6) * 100
= 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time. 
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter, and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly earnings = (Cost of renting the studio per week) + (Number of students * Cost per student per session * Number of sessions per week)
Weekly earnings = $25 (rent) + (10 students * $1.50 * 3 sessions) 
Weekly earnings = $25 + $45
Weekly earnings = $70

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $70 * 4
Monthly earnings = $280

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chocolate bars in each box. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. 

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. 

We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

Solving for x, we get:
x = 64 / 4 = 16
x = 56 / 7 = 8

Since x = 16, we can see that Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box. 

Now, to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract Martha's number of chocolate bars per box from Peter's number of chocolate bars per box:

16 - 8 = 8

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = 61920 * 0.10
Cost = 6192

The cost to fill the pool is $6192."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16. 

The number of female students over 16 years old is the total number of students over 16 minus the number of male students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The total number of female students is 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 91% of the initial charge, or 0.91x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 93% of the charge after the first 5 hours, or 0.93 * 0.91x = 0.855x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.855x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.855:

x = 0.28 / 0.855
x = 0.327

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 32.7%.

The final answer is: 32.7"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage from wages is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, and assuming she works 40 hours a week, her weekly tip income is $15 * 40 = $600. 

Her total weekly income is $400 (wages) + $600 (tips) = $1000. 

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is 0.2 * $10000 = $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly income ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. Since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he actually has.

Let's assume he has $0 left, as he can't spend more than he has. 

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the amount he has by the cost of one plum: $0 / $0.25 = 0.

However, since Jamaar can't buy 0 plums, we need to recalculate the amount he actually has.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 6 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply this rate by the number of pages he read (18 pages) to find the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests checked out late, leaving 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

Now, the hotel has 61 guests + 30 guests = 91 guests.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests.

"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can calculate as follows:

Total questions = 60
Easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
Average questions = (100% - 40%) / 2 = 30% of 60 = 0.3 * 60 = 18
Difficult questions = 100% - 40% - 30% = 30% of 60 = 0.3 * 60 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.
She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is (0.5 * 18) + (0.5 * 18) = 18 + 9 = 27 questions.

Total questions she is sure to get = 18 + 27 = 45

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. The earnings from large stuffed animals is $12x, and the earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = 8x.

The total earnings is given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

12x + 8x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's multiply the total number of sandwiches per day by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches consumed in one week: 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to first find the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other individuals. 

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we can subtract the eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs left for the friends. 

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by the twins) = 40 eggs.

However, we know that 10 eggs were not found by the friends. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day. 

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30. 

1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Let x be the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches.

The ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price for the first package is 2:3.
The ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price for the second package is 4:6.

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up the following equation:

2/3 = 4/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 4 * 3
2x = 12
x = 12/2
x = 6

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6.

"To determine how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of balloons Sally had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

Sally found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2
Total number of blue balloons = 6 (added) + 2 (remaining) = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. 
Total number of red balloons = 15
Total number of yellow balloons = 6
Total number of blue balloons = 8
Total number of green balloons = 7

Total number of balloons = 15 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

Let's break it down:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% chance (100% - 40% chance of extension)
   - In this case, Marcus still has to turn in his homework: 60% * 100% = 60%

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 40% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 40% * 0% = 0%

3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 50% * 0% = 0%

Now, we add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework in each scenario: 60% + 0% + 0% = 60%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 60%.

60%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first calculate the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is 150 * 3 = 450.

The final answer is 450."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Total daily income: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day (parking)

Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Jury pay per hour after expenses: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move between each bottle.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle. Therefore, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since he has two boxes of apples, and each box contains 40 apples, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Subtracting the total cost from her initial $50, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since the comforter is made of two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population of South America = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
= 26 * 5 * 1000

The final answer is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in their heights:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first determine the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours of work done by the team, we first need to calculate the total number of days worked. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day, the total hours worked per day is:

3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours

Now, we multiply the total hours worked per day by the total number of days worked to get the total hours worked by the team:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: The car is worth 100% of its original price, which is $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

Rounded to two decimal places, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it's $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft in length and your floor area is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed as follows:

200 SqFt / 1ft (tile length) = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $72. 

The total cost for James is the normal cost plus the increased cost: $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this cost for a year, we multiply the total cost by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is 2304."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle at a time.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets Greg does in a week. He does 4 twin sets and 1 king set, so that's 4 + 1 = 5 sets per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year is 5 sets/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 sets/year.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads he needs to do in a year. His machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, so the maximum number of sets he can do in a load is 2 + 1 = 3 sets.

To find the number of loads, we divide the total number of sets by the number of sets per load: 260 sets/year ÷ 3 sets/load = 86.67 loads/year.

Since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can round down to 87 loads/year because Greg can't do a fraction of a load.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate: 

Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10. 
Solving for x, we get x = 7. 
So Jake ate 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by each person: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to complete the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that failed to reach the farmers is:

Total fertiliser that failed to reach = Number of trucks that failed * Tons per truck
= 5 * 20
= 100 tons

Now, we need to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. Since 5 trucks failed, the number of trucks that successfully delivered is:

Number of trucks that successfully delivered = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

The total amount of fertiliser that was successfully delivered is:

Total fertiliser that was successfully delivered = Number of trucks that successfully delivered * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into two groups of 3 pounds each. 

For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price ($4.00 per pound), which is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 
For the second 3 pounds, he will pay half price ($2.00 per pound), which is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost will be the sum of the two amounts: $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to first determine the number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 8 guests (28 - 20 = 8). 

The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48. Adding this to the initial fee, the total cost is $125 + $48 = $173.

The final answer is: $173"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 

315 - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Now, we divide the remaining bananas by 3 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day. 

291 / 3 = 97 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats 97 bananas each day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed in the given time frame. 

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he completed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. This means he completed 500 pieces in that hour.

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed in the given hour, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total cost of the roses, we first need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (15 / 12)
Cost of 15 roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the roses from the $25:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$6.25 = 6 * $1 + 0.25
= 6 * 4 quarters + 1 quarter
= 24 quarters + 1 quarter
= 25 quarters

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: 162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has already saved and then find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total and has already saved 120, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

To find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week. 

80 / 10 = 8

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500. So, the price at which he sold it is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

The original price of the watch is $2000, and the price at which Mr. Rogers sold it is $1800. To find the discount, we subtract the selling price from the original price:

$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

We are given that the time is 4 hours, so we multiply the number of seconds in an hour by 4: 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, we multiply the number of jellyfish created per second by the total number of seconds: 5 * 14400 = 72000.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Next, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

Now, we need to add the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home to get the total time:

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To determine the amount of money saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then the total cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, she will buy a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. The sum of their shares should equal the total length of the fence, which is 100 feet.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, we can calculate that as 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes, we can calculate 15% of 300, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 7 days in a week. So, the total minutes in a week is 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes.

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in classes and the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total minutes spent on learning per week is 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, the total hours spent on learning per week is 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height the ball reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3 to find the height after the second bounce.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

After the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the last step. 

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the original amount was 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and then sum them up. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left after Ellen's brother took his share.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, shook 3, and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The probability of choosing a shaken soda is 2/9, since there are 2 shaken sodas out of the total 9 remaining sodas.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is therefore 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/9) * 100 = 22.22%

The final answer is 22.22."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the individuals. 

We know that Mike is 24 years old. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age: 
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time per day in hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

Total time for 5 days: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that when the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her current salary, her annual savings would be 20% of $100,000, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Next, we need to calculate her annual expenses. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses would be 40% of $100,000, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Now, we can calculate her annual savings after expenses, which is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This means she is actually spending more than she is saving, which is not possible. However, assuming she wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

Since she can't save more than she earns, let's assume she saves the maximum amount possible, which is her annual salary minus her expenses. Her annual savings would be $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years. The total amount would be $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she can only save $60,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $1,200,000. This would be $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, since she already has 20 years of savings, she doesn't need to work 20 more years. She has already saved for 20 years, and she needs to live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years. 

So, she needs to work for 20 years to save for 20 years and live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to break down the problem into steps. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means we divide 100 by 4, which equals 25 centimeters per part.

Next, we take each of these 4 parts and divide them into 5 equal parts. This means we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters per final cut.

So, the length of each final cut will be 5 centimeters.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys to calculate the total population. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and we are given that this equals 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total population as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 40% of x = 240.

Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get 0.4x = 240.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Since the question asks for the number of girls, we need to find 60% of the total population (100% - 40% = 60%). 

60% of 600 is 0.6 * 600 = 360.

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the coupon discount.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we subtract the coupon discount: $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

The total height of heels is the sum of the heights of the heels worn by the 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and the 3 women wearing 2 inch heels.

Total height = (3 x 4) + (3 x 2)
Total height = 12 + 6
Total height = 18

There are a total of 6 heels at the party.

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels
Average height = 18 / 6
Average height = 3

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30. 

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate the required daily distance as follows:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, she is currently hiking 125 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the current daily distance from the required daily distance:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To determine the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each color of ball and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He then spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

So, the blinking rate is 255 / 5 = 51 times per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. 

We can do this by dividing 459 by the blinking rate (51 times per minute). 

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After Tate's purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 5
Difference: 8 - 5 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores. 

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. 
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. 
Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to add up the time each person took: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven by John in a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The distance for one round trip is calculated as follows:
Distance = 2 * speed * time
Distance = 2 * 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:
Total distance = 280 miles * 2
Total distance = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Brian will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x.

We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can set up the equation: 2x = 70

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 70 / 2 = 35

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift.

Let's calculate the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
Since the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker needs to produce 20 + 20 = 40 toys in 10 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour by dividing the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (40) by the number of hours (10). 
40 / 10 = 4 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Now, we need to add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog to find the total weight of both dogs. 60 (Kory's dog) + 45 (Elijah's dogs) = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and Kris received half of the stickers from Luis, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of stickers Luis received from Seth. Then, Kris received x/2 stickers from Luis. We know Kris had 16 stickers, so x/2 = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 32.

Since Luis gave half of the stickers to Kris, and Luis received 32 stickers from Seth, we can set up another equation: 
Let y be the number of stickers Seth had initially. Then, Luis received y/2 stickers from Seth. We know Luis had 32 stickers, so y/2 = 32. Solving for y, we get y = 64.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by Alfie's daily flight distance: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed by multiplying the average car's speed by 5.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following information:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A = M = S + 12

Now, we can substitute the value of A and M into the second equation:
(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now that we know C, we can find A:
A = M = S + 12
A = 9 + 12
A = 21

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference:
Difference = C - A
Difference = 21 - 21
Difference = 0

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound). 

Total weight in pounds = (200 ounces + 200 ounces) / 16 = 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds (crayons) + 25 pounds (boxes) = 50 pounds.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much John makes, we need to break down the process step by step.

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we can calculate the number of logs as follows:

80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet of usable wood
Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the usable wood by the log length to find the number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs

Next, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log, we can multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:
16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank:
80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the amount of money Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the brother's salary as B. 
Valerie's salary = 1/2 * B
Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can set up the equation: 
5000 = 1/2 * B
To solve for B, we multiply both sides by 2: 
B = 5000 * 2
B = 10000

Now that we know the brother's salary, we can find their mother's salary. The mother earns twice their combined salary. 
Combined salary = Valerie's salary + brother's salary
Combined salary = 5000 + 10000
Combined salary = 15000
Mother's salary = 2 * combined salary
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries: 
Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds from all the trees: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. Let's denote the temperature of the unknown mug as x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the amount of water in the bottle is now 4 ounces. This means the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is 28 ounces (since 8 ounces were poured out).

Now, Donny pours 1 ounce from the unknown mug into the bottle. The amount of water in the bottle is now 5 ounces.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) ≥ 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 8

So, the minimum temperature of the unknown mug is 8 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks).
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows.

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days.
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of cows and chickens: 
Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he received 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 3 scoops require 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, 1 scoop requires 3 / 3 = 1 potato. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 1 scoop requires 1 potato, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1 potato/scoop = 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first determine the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, and we have already accounted for 17 green and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 17 - 34 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we first need to determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from bouquets per day. 

Divide the daily earnings from bouquets by the cost of a bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, multiply the number of bouquets per day by 3: 7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so multiply the number of bouquets by the number of sunflowers per bouquet: 21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

Faraday sold 252 sunflowers in 3 days."
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. The revenue from selling 60% of his inventory is $84. To find the loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16.

For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert the number of eggs to a numerical value. Since there are three dozen eggs, we multiply 3 by 12 to get 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the total cost for one fish for the entire month would be:

31 days * $1/day = $31

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all of them for the month of May would be:

$31 * 3 = $93

The final answer is 93."
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses she had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Number of roses left after giving some to her mother = 30 - 24 = 6
Total number of roses now = 6 + 15 = 21

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person gets T/3 seashells.

Substituting T = 5x + 5, we get:

Each person gets (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. We can do this by using the information that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. 

Since Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells and Carlos collected 2x seashells, we can set up the equation:

2x + 5 = 27 (since Jim collected 27 seashells)

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

Now that we know 'x', we can find the total number of seashells:

T = 5x + 5
T = 5(11) + 5
T = 60

Now, we can find the number of seashells each person gets:

Each person gets T/3
Each person gets 60/3
Each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total cost of the devices and the total revenue from selling them.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total revenue from selling 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per person * 100% = 46000 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total energy demand of 2300 people. 

Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many days it will take to meet the demand, we divide the total energy demand by the daily production capacity:

46000 bottles / 4200 bottles per day = 11 days

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed to meet the demand:

46000 bottles / 11 days = 4181.8 bottles per day

Now, we subtract the daily production capacity from the total number of bottles needed per day to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:

4181.8 bottles per day - 4200 bottles per day = -18.2 bottles per day

However, since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

To meet the demand, Hortex would need to produce 4200 bottles per day for 11 days, and then produce 4182 more bottles (rounding up 4181.8) on the 12th day.

The total number of bottles Hortex needs to produce is 4200 * 11 + 4182 = 46282 bottles.

The final answer is: 46282"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, we know that 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Next, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the total babies wear bows. Since there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2, since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage of babies wearing bows that are also wearing purple. This is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage is (2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 74.7%.

The final answer is 74.7."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Abraham initially has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of this remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to add the money he earned from each sale. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $90 from the third sale. 

$50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply it by the payment per apartment.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than 400, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

Now, we add 240 to 400 to get the total number of apartments in the last complex: 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we have the total number of apartments: 400 (from the first two complexes) + 640 (from the last complex) = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, so he collects garbage from 3 * 1040 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call it x. So, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can set up an equation for the 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 3 * 50 (since it produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree). Solving for x, we get x = 350.

Now that we know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree, we can calculate the total amount produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: 350 - 200 = 150 fruits
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous equation:
5(B + 7) + Y = 37
Expand and simplify:
5B + 35 + Y = 37
Subtract 35 from both sides:
5B + Y = 2

Now we have two equations:
5B + Y = 2
B = Y - 7

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 2
Expand and simplify:
5Y - 35 + Y = 2
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 2
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 37
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 6.17 (approximately)

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 6.17 - 7
B = -0.83 (approximately)

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * -0.83
R = -3.32 (approximately)

However, since the length of a rope cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the initial setup of the equations. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Re-evaluate the equations:
R = 4B
B = Y - 7
R + B + Y = 37

Substitute the first equation into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous equation:
4(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand and simplify:
4Y - 28 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5Y - 28 = 37
Add 28 to both sides:
5Y = 65
Divide both sides by 5:
Y = 13

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 13 - 7
B = 6

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 6
R = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's denote the amount she gave to her sister as x. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa was given $15 and gave $3 to her sister. Therefore, the amount left with Rissa is:

15 - 3 = 12

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to his sister, he also gave $3. 

Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to his sister. Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:

5 - 3 = 2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are four colors of paint and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, let's denote the amount of each color as x. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided among the remaining three colors. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. 

The remaining half of the mural (6 pints) is divided among the three colors (red, white, and purple). Since the three colors have equal amounts, we can divide 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 / 3 = 2 pints per color. 

Since we know that the amount of red paint is x, and we've determined that x = 2, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is: 
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is: 
Area of living room = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together to find the total area of the house: 
Total area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs $12. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we can divide the total cost by the cost per pod:

Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods
= $0.10 per pod

Now, we can divide the amount of money you have ($1) by the cost per pod to find out how many cycles you can run:

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:

Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much chalk the teacher started with. Since he used 45% of the chalk on Monday, that means he has 55% of the chalk left. We know that 55% of the original amount is equal to 2 inches of chalk.

Let's denote the original amount of chalk as x. We can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2 / 0.55
x = 3.6363 (approximately)

So, the teacher started with approximately 3.6363 inches of chalk.

Now, we know that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. We want to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk. We can set up an equation:

0.20 * (3.6363) = 0.7273

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches. We can divide the remaining chalk by 0.20:

3.6363 / 0.20 = 18.1815

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, we should also consider that the teacher started with 3.6363 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. This means that the remaining chalk is 55% of the original amount, which is 2 inches. 

To find the number of days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide the remaining chalk by 0.20:

2 / 0.20 = 10

However, this is the number of days it takes for the remaining chalk to be exactly 2 inches. Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

The correct answer is 11 days."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is: 1,800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. He put 1 in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Then, he picked up these 7 apples, put all but 1 in his pocket and threw the remaining 1 at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples and went home. Therefore, he brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed. 

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles for these three days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles for these two days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net rate of snowball production is 1/3 - 2/30 = 1/3 - 1/15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of 2/15. 

60 / (2/15) = 60 * (15/2) = 450 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 450 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can express John's age at the time of Digimon's release as 2x.

We also know that the time difference between now and the time of Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 - 2x = x.

Solving for x, we get: 
28 = 3x
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider the time of release as a specific point in time rather than a range. 

So, Jim was approximately 9 years old when Digimon was released.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, so the remaining number of slices is 8 - 1 = 7.

Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we need to add up the number of slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 

7 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 12

Therefore, they all ate 12 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus

For taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
For cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add the earnings together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

40 gallons (whale's blood) * 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood:

120 gallons (shark's blood) * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

The total amount of blood that ten sharks have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

The number of black pens is twice the number of red pens, so the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted on both days: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 80.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8, which simplifies to 4x = 32.

Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x: x = 32 / 4, which simplifies to x = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor to get the height from the ground to the second floor, then subtract that from the total height of the house.

The height from the ground to the second floor is 180 - 60 = 120 inches. 

Now, subtracting this from the total height of the house: 420 - 120 = 300 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 300 inches.

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * $300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in those months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus now is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, this would mean that some grades would not be able to participate. To accommodate all grades, we need to calculate the total number of groups needed:

- Grade 4: 10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, rounded down to 1 group

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write the equation as:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs, we first need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows, each 35 inches wide, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of brownies Carly made. We know that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. 

The number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

We know that Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure. 

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since Karen gets a 20% discount for getting both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 

20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3. 

The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art. 

The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of paintings each person has. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

We are also given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can set up the equation: (x + 8) - 12 = 27.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 4 = 27.

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get: x = 31.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initially, the price in November was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%, so the new price is:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so the new price is:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate Charlie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate his earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately.

For the 4 standard rate lessons, Charlie earns 4 * $80 = $320.

For the 2 reduced rate lessons, Charlie's rate is 25% less than the standard rate, which is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60. So, he earns 2 * $60 = $120 from these lessons.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's represent the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, we can substitute x with 20:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for Pomelos given away:

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Regina has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he spent traveling. Assuming he travels for 24 hours a day, the total time spent traveling is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total time spent traveling: 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, and we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes eaten by Madeline to the total number of grapes used by the others: 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick to the number of substitute teachers.

The final answer is: 22"
"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00.

The cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00 per week. 

The total weekly cost is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the capacity of each shelf and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total capacity of the middle two shelves is 10 + 10 = 20 books. Since the middle shelf holds B/2 books, we can set up the equation:

B/2 + B = 20

Combine like terms:

(3/2)B = 20

Multiply both sides by 2/3:

B = 40/3

Since B represents the number of books the bottom shelf can hold, we can calculate the capacity of each shelf:

- Bottom shelf: 40/3
- Middle shelf: 40/6 = 20/3
- Top shelf: 40/3 - 5 = 35/3

Now, we can calculate the total capacity of the bookcases:

Bottom shelf: 40/3
Middle shelf: 20/3
Top shelf: 35/3

Total capacity: 40/3 + 20/3 + 35/3 = 95/3

Since Elly has 110 books, we can divide the total number of books by the total capacity to determine the number of bookcases needed:

110 / (95/3) = 110 * 3 / 95 = 33.15789

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 34 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Next, let's find the total revenue. Since Rose sells 3 eggs for $1, and she has 5 dozens (60 eggs), the total revenue is:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = $20

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the total number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests to achieve a 70% overall score.

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the required number of correct answers as follows:

70% of 110 questions = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total required number of correct answers:

77 (required correct answers) - 42 (correct answers from the first test) = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game. 

Since she has been playing 40 games every year for four years, we can calculate the total number of games as follows:

40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since she scores 21 points per game, we can multiply the total number of games by the points per game:

160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by the family.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per person, so the total number of flashlights is 4 * 2 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles.

The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16. The total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles. The total number of flashlights is 8, and the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

So, Brianna's family is using 8 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, we need to add up the time it takes to complete all six sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and then subtract the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the water part: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts: 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the time it takes to speak one page by dividing the number of words per page by the words per minute.

Time per page = 450 words / 0.16 words per second = 2812.5 seconds

To find the total time it takes to speak 10 pages, we multiply the time per page by 10.

Total time = 2812.5 seconds * 10 = 28125 seconds

Converting this to minutes, we get:

Total time = 28125 seconds / 60 = 468.75 minutes

Therefore, it would take John approximately 468.75 minutes to speak 10 pages.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, which consists of 5 days. To find the total number of people for these 5 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add up the number of people for all 7 days: 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 360.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 360.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice for 5 gallons. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons as follows:

5 cups / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, Tim will need 1/2 cup of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon as follows:

1/2 cup / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 1/2 * 6 = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 33 lemons in total.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption of dog food is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled and then determine the net distance from his house.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
Distance east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of Helen's trip is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus trip cost: $240 + $56 = $296.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas had initially. We know that Dallas dropped 4 marbles and ended up with 21. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Dallas had as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: x - 4 = 21

To solve for 'x', we add 4 to both sides of the equation: x = 21 + 4
x = 25

Now that we know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. Since Mazie gave away a total of 52 marbles, and Dallas initially had 25, we subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received.

52 - 25 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. There are 3 people in total, so the cost of the adult ticket is $12 and the cost of the child ticket is $8. 

The total cost of the tickets is $12 + $8 = $20.

Next, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to get the total cost. $20 + $6 = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

The total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To calculate the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.

For the bowls, she needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

"To determine how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed each pig eats in a week. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total amount of feed each pig eats in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of feed each pig eats in a week is 8 * 7 = 56 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of feed all five pigs eat in a week. Since there are five pigs, the total amount of feed all pigs eat in a week is 5 * 56 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of guests attending the party. Since John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we need to subtract these from the total number of hot dogs required. 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs required by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2, so we multiply the number of packs needed by the cost per pack to find the total cost. 6 * $2 = $12.

The final answer is 12."

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making the total 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making the total 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. So, we need to subtract them from the total, which is 60 - 5 = 55 children.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The two brothers are 12 and 24 years old, so their total age is 12 + 24 = 36.

"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break it down into two components: meditation and yoga.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which is a total of 30 minutes per day. Since she does this for 7 days a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

To find the total time spent on both meditation and yoga per week, we add the two values: 210 + 300 = 510 minutes per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in the given period, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 * 4 = 2040 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog creates 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (created) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks as follows:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in each basket. 

The first basket has 10 eggs, and the second basket has twice as many eggs, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance (2 miles) in the same amount of time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as follows: 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of Aaron = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, her speed is twice his speed: 
Speed of Vanessa = 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 miles per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles: 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/4 miles per minute) = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required length to find out how much more he needs to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine. 

The cost of meals per night is 2 meals * $5 per meal = $10. Adding the cost of the wine, the total cost per night is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is $15 per night * 2 nights = $30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price. 

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:

Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost separately.

The cost of the radiator is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320.

The labor cost is $50 per hour, and it took 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is: $470"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 40 - 2b + 4b = 70, which simplifies to 2b = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into c = 20 - b, which gives us c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
