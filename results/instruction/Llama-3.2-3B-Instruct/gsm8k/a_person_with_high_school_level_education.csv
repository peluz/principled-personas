"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the cost of repairs from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Cost of repairs
= $200,000 - $50,000
= $150,000

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week = 3
Distance per sprint = 60 meters

Total distance per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total distance per week = 3 * 60
Total distance per week = 180 meters

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens and subtract that from the total amount of feed she has available.

She gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 

15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed she needs for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount needed:

60 - 40 = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 60% of the file (200 GB * 0.6 = 120 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the first download is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Then, the system restarts and Carla has to download the remaining 80 GB (200 GB - 120 GB) at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the second download is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Adding the time taken for both downloads, we get 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took to install the updates. So, the total time taken is 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we need to add up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home. Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

So, John is 355 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

355"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.5

Since the tree needs to break even (i.e., the net profit should be $0), we need to find the number of years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90.

Number of years to break even: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (2/3x - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

x/3 = 6

Then, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for both options.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is greater than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from teaching would be: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $20/hour = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from coaching would be: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $30/hour = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 * 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - (4 + 2)
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Time left to cover the remaining distance = 1 hour
Speed needed = Distance / Time
Speed needed = 6 / 1
Speed needed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we have 24 liters of the mixture, so we need to find the amount of water in 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of water in 24 liters of the mixture.

Let's say the amount of water in 24 liters of the mixture is x. We know that the amount of water in the orange drink is 20/3 liters, and the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. The total amount of water in the mixture is x + 9 liters.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, we can set up the equation:

x + 9 = 24

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

x = 15

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows: 
31 - 6 = 25

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son is 2 years younger than Raymond. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 2 = 23

Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.

His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original price is x. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know he paid $19.50, so we can set up the equation: 0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.75: x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she eats in 60 days and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after his second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by adding the distance before the first stop and the distance after the second stop: 20 + 45 = 65 miles.

The final answer is: 65"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation:

Cost of boots + $99 = Cost of boots + $5

Subtracting the cost of boots from both sides gives us:

$99 = $5

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. 

To find out how much money he had initially, we add the money he made from selling the Lego sets and the money he had left: 195 + 5 = $200.

Now, we subtract the money he spent on video games from the initial amount: 200 - 160 = $40.

Since he initially had $200 and spent $40, he has 200 - 40 = $160 left.

However, we need to find out how many Lego sets he has left. We know he initially had 13 Lego sets and made $195 from selling them. 

To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we divide the money he has left ($160) by the price of each Lego set ($15): 160 / 15 = 10.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

John has 10 Lego sets left."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total distance he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day, and half as much on the other two days. 
So, the total hours he runs in a week is 3 + (3/2) + (3/2) = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total hours.

Speed = Total Distance / Total Hours
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we multiply Suzy's age by 2 to find Ben's iPhone age.
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from Polly where she can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. 

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames are within 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon when holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since you can have 0.8 servings, and each serving is 5 grams, you can have 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total cost = Number of candles * (Beeswax + Wicks)
Total cost = 20 * ($10.00)
Total cost = $200.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The negative sign indicates that Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up an equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased:

Initial Post-it notes - Post-it notes used at work = Post-it notes remaining
300 - 220 = 23

This equation is true, so we can conclude that the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is indeed 300.

80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of the blue ties. 

The cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of the red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:

200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. 

First, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot to get 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels at 10 mph, the distance he covers in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 * 3
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to travel back, we use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys he needs to remove by dividing the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 is greater than $520. 
The difference in revenue is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since we are looking for the day with higher revenue, we will consider the absolute difference, which is $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the kittens from both cats: 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie trip and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single trip.

The cost of a movie trip is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single trip ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is:

$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is:

$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the annual pension for 10 years. The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is:

$50,000 * 10 = $500,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:

$1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000

Since this is the total value of the pension, we need to find 5% of this value to get her annual pension:

$1,500,000 * 5% = $75,000

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $75,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = 840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.
10% of 140 is 0.1 * 140 = 14
So, the amount she paid for the second half is:
140 - 14 = 126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = 756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount she paid for the year:
840 + 756 = 1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after she traveled 100 miles. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used from the total capacity of the tank.

Gas used = 4 gallons
Total capacity of the tank = 12 gallons
Gas left = Total capacity - Gas used
Gas left = 12 - 4
Gas left = 8 gallons

Now, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank by dividing the gas left by the amount of gas used to fill it up.

Miles per gallon = Gas left / Gas used
Miles per gallon = 8 / 4
Miles per gallon = 2

So, Sophia can drive 2 miles per gallon.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on both activities per week is 6 (TV) + 3 (reading) = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on both activities in 4 weeks, we multiply the total hours per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 48.

48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls: 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 / 5 = 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays.

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15 per student, the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * 15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe. 

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Total instructions = 20 (first recipe) + 40 (second recipe) = 60

The total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes is 60."

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost and the total interest to find the total amount Shiela will pay: $750 + $15 = $765.

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3: $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255."

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage, the third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 to find out how many bags Cecilia will use in the first year.

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry = 400 pounds
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages.

For the 3-for-$2.50 package, we can divide 18 by 3 to get 6 packages. So, the cost would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

For the 2-for-$1 package, we can divide 18 by 2 to get 9 packages. So, the cost would be 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in the 2-for-$1 package is the better option.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

= $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to calculate how much water the two girls got together. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we multiply 24 by 1/6. 

24 * 1/6 = 4 liters

So, the two girls got 4 liters together. 

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got to the 4 liters the girls got. 

4 + 6 = 10 liters

So, 10 liters of water were left.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away or used is 9 + 28 = 37.

Now, we subtract the stickers he gave away or used from the total number of stickers he had: 54 - 37 = 17.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. We can write this as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the football team won 15 games.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed would be G - 2. 

We know that Lee's speed is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: G - 2 = 38. Solving for G, we get G = 40.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed was 40 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new speed by multiplying his original speed by 1.1 (which is equivalent to a 10% increase). 

Gerald's new speed = 40 * 1.1 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is (x + 20) - 5.

We also know that the total number of cars on the motorway is 30. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 20 - 5) = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + x + 15 = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 15 = 30.

Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 15.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7.5.

Since we can't have half a car, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the question asks for the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 7.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 42 / 3 * 10
Time = 14 * 10
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is 500."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats: 5 + 15 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants on the left side:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas first. 

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it's 10 * $0.20 = $2.00.

The total cost after the cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since she can't row a fraction of a set, we round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and she rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, we multiply 3 sets by 2 liters per set to get 6 liters.

The time it took her to row 3 sets of 20 feet is 3 sets * 16 seconds per set = 48 seconds. Since she started rowing 16 seconds into the 64 seconds, we subtract 16 seconds from the total time to find the time she spent rowing: 64 - 16 = 48 seconds.

Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, and she rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, we multiply 3 sets by 2 liters per set to get 6 liters.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons per day and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants per day (2) by the number of days (15). 

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

However, 5 flowers did not grow, so we need to subtract those from the total.

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can write another equation:
B = 50D

Since we already know the value of B, we can substitute it into the equation:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is 1.5 times the original price. 
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $10 = $15 per board. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $16 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150. 
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: 
$270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately).

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio: 17.14 * 7 = 120.

So, Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes he bought by the cost of each pair.

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can calculate her current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% over the past four years, we can calculate her current salary as follows:
Lylah's current salary = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
Lylah's current salary = $30,769 + 0.4($30,769)
Lylah's current salary = $30,769 + $12,307.60
Lylah's current salary = $43,076.60

Now that we know Adrien's salary four years ago ($40,000) and Lylah's current salary ($43,076.60), we can calculate their total salary four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $40,000 + $43,076.60
Total salary = $83,076.60

The final answer is: $83,076.60"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses per week by 4.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

So, Sadie slept 29 hours throughout the week.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as 'x'. 

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters needing stamps is 2/3 of the original 60 letters. 

So, 2/3 * 60 = 40 letters needed stamps.

We know that after Jennie puts stamps on these 40 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters becomes 30. 

This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is x + 40 = 30.

We know that this total is 30. 

x + 40 = 30

x = 30 - 40
x = -10

This still doesn't make sense.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is 'x + 5'.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after sampling is 'x + 5 - 3'.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that 'x + 5 - 3' equals 12.

Now, let's set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine the constants: x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought initially had 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them have. 

Lily has 50 friends. 
Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

The total number of friends they have together is 50 + 70 = 120.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients = 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital's total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000
The hospital's total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

The hospital makes $10,000 profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   Since there are 60 elves initially, a third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

So, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply that by 12.

Number of car washes per month: 4
Cost of each car wash: $15
Total cost per month: 4 * $15 = $60
Total cost per year: $60 * 12 = $720

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the total number of Scottish unicorns: 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply the total number of unicorns by 1/3.
   Total unicorns = 27
   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Next, we find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final cost of the order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the number of questions by the time taken: 
75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed.

Since Mark completed 5 questions per hour, we can find the time taken for the second test by dividing the total questions by the rate:
100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours.

However, Mark only had 6 hours to complete the second test. So, he completed 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions in the second test.

Now, we subtract the questions completed from the total questions in each test to find the number of questions left incomplete:

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to 48. 

48 + 22 = 70.

So, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the number of queens. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we can represent the number of queens as x. This means there are 2x baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can represent the number of worker bees as 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens should be equal to 700. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (x = 100), we can find the number of worker bees: 4x = 4 * 100 = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week and multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he worked these 14 hours at $10 an hour, his earnings would be 14 * 10 = $140.

The final answer is 140."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 

The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

The tax on these items is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of food items to the cost of non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is 16."
"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (45 bees) return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 45 bees.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, he will be waiting for Tim. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then add them together.

For bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * 25 cents = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = 2.50 dollars
For tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = 2.25 dollars
For the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 dollars

Now, let's add the amounts together: 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since we can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll correct this in the next step.
6. Since the pigeons ate 9 fries but there were only 7 fries left after the seagull, we'll assume the pigeons ate all the remaining fries, leaving 0 fries. This means the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 0 fries.
7. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 7 = 14/3 = 4.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 4 fries.
8. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 7 - 4 = 3 fries.
9. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 fries.
10. Since 2 fries were left after the ants ate, and 5 fries were left at the end, the initial number of fries in the pack must have been 2 + 5 = 7 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to add the total hours for both types of days. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Now, we add the total hours for both types of days: 
144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, which is inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are 12 inches in 2 feet.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches per baguette (since 2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."

- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
She runs 180 yards * 34 times = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time to peel one potato into seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, we add the time to cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time to prep one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

They made $25 in profit, and since profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation: 

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and let's assume the cost of sugar is x dollars per gallon. The total cost is $3 + x.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:
$10 - ($3 + x) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
$10 - $3 - x = $25
$7 - x = $25

Now, we can solve for x:
-x = $25 - $7
-x = $18
x = -$18

Since we can't have a negative cost, this means that the cost of sugar is not a variable we can use in this problem. We can assume the cost of sugar is a fixed amount per gallon.

However, we can still find the total cost of lemons. We know that the total cost is $25 + the cost of sugar. We also know that the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon. Since we don't know the cost of sugar, we can't find the exact amount spent on lemons.

But we can find the total gallons they made by using the profit. The profit is $25, and the revenue per gallon is $10. So, the total gallons they made is $25 / $10 = 2.5 gallons.

Since they can't make a fraction of a gallon, we can round down to 2 gallons. The cost of lemons for 2 gallons is 2 * $3 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these expenses from his total income: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have left is 350."
"To find the total number of crabs, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got as follows:

3/4 * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the number of votes the loser got is:

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40. 

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. The answer is 160."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15.
   - Since Mark was 5 years older than that, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
3. Since Mark is two years younger than Jean, Jean's age two years ago would be 20 + 2 = 22.
4. To find Jean's current age, we add 2 to Jean's age two years ago: 22 + 2 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. 
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. 
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was greater than 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) + P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/2 + 1/2
= 1

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) = 1 - P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= 1 - 1/2
= 1/2

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4.

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling two even numbers in a row | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/4)
= 1/8

Now, we can calculate the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row)
= 1/2 - 1/8
= 3/8

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(3/8) * 100 = 37.5%

The final answer is 37.5."
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide the number of apples her mom picked by 2, since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Number of apples Jenna's mom picked: 20
Number of apples Jenna picked: 20 / 2 = 10

Total number of apples they both picked: 20 (mom) + 10 (Jenna) = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used for the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces left for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to divide the total number of straw pieces left for the rats by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15.

So, there are 15 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $100
Rate = 2% or 0.02
Time = 3 months

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we can find the total number of bags transported by dividing the total transportation cost by the cost per bag:
Total bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Total bags transported = $140 / $2
Total bags transported = 70

Since the trader bought the bags, the number of bags sold is the difference between the total bags transported and the number of bags bought:
Number of bags bought = Number of bags transported - Number of bags sold
Number of bags bought = 70 - 13
Number of bags bought = 57

Now, we can find the number of bags sold:
Number of bags sold = Number of bags bought - Number of bags transported
Number of bags sold = 57 - 70
Number of bags sold = -13

However, this is incorrect as the number of bags sold cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the total revenue and total cost:
Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total profit:
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $400 - $260
Total profit = $140

Now, we can find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total profit
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we can find the total number of bags transported by dividing the total transportation cost by the cost per bag:
Total bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Total bags transported = $140 / $2
Total bags transported = 70

Since the trader bought the bags, the number of bags bought is equal to the total bags transported:
Number of bags bought = Total bags transported
Number of bags bought = 70

Now, we can find the number of bags sold:
Number of bags sold = Number of bags bought - Number of bags transported
Number of bags sold = 70 - 70
Number of bags sold = 0

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. So, the total cost of the rides is:
Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses. 
Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102.00

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102.00 / 3
Cost per person = $34.00

The final answer is: $34.00"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute.
He collects for 3 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Total peaches collected = peaches per minute * total minutes
Total peaches collected = 2 * 180
Total peaches collected = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

First, we multiply the amount of insects needed per duck by the number of ducks: 
3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, we divide the total amount by 7 days: 
35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day

The flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To find the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees each year.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. After 10 years, the net change is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of trees after 10 years.

First, we need to find the total number of trees after 10 years. We add the net change to the initial number of trees: 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Now, we calculate 30% of 130 trees: 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, 39 trees die. To find the number of trees left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is 91."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. 

She needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2

"To find the cost of one pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots available.

Total carrots available = 200 pounds
Total carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Carrots not used = Total carrots available - Total carrots distributed
Carrots not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2 to find the amount he earns from Publisher B.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, he gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

The final answer is: $104,500."
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she bought and add it to the number of pens she already had.

First, let's calculate the number of pens she bought:
- Blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens
- Red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens
Total pens bought: 54 + 12 = 66 pens

Now, let's add the pens she already had:
- Green pens: 22

"To find the average of the six tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by 6. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
To do this, we multiply the desired average by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the last three weeks to find the total kilometers he rode in total. 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 460."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 3 plates. 

So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups: $16800 / 240 = $70.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 for each babysitting job and $4 for each lawn mowing job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting job ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting jobs.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing jobs. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

4x + y = 60, where x is the number of babysitting jobs and y is the number of lawn mowing jobs.

We already know that x = 12. 

4(12) + y = 60
48 + y = 60
y = 12

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2 (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens).

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation:
3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:
8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:
8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:
r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

Third day customers = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

The final answer is 183."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool at that time, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4x = 4(x - 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 4x - 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get 0 = -64. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago is incorrect.

However, let's re-evaluate the situation. If the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, then the big pool would have 2x gallons of water now, and the small pool would have x gallons of water now. 

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 4(x - 16). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 4x - 64. Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get -2x = -64. Dividing both sides by -2, we get x = 32.

So, the small pool had 32 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, the small pool now has 32 - 16 = 16 gallons of water.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

We know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the information given. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Total water in the tank now = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%

He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. 
The total cost of these items is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $10.50. 
He also adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost now is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6

"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many melons were remaining, we subtract the initial number of harvested melons from the total.

Remaining melons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining melons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many melons were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested melons from the remaining melons.

Melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week. 

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. 

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he eats per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce.

21 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week per vine = 7 vines

So, Steve needs 7 vines to meet his weekly tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

So, Ram can make 25 new pens from the ink of the 25 pens. 

The total number of pens Ram will have is the sum of the original 25 pens and the 25 new pens.

25 original pens + 25 new pens = 50 pens

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say Robert has x candies. 
Then John has 2x candies. 
We know John has 54 candies, so 2x = 54. 
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 27. 
So Robert has 27 candies. 

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes per week. 

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of minutes it takes to write a page to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. 30 pages / 6 minutes per page = 5 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide the minutes by 60. 5 minutes / 60 = 0.0833 hours per week.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we subtract the total minutes used from his plan to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave the fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin had 27 fries in the end. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides: x = 27 - 7, x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies Sue ate. 
Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

To find out how many cookies her sister ate, we need to add the number of cookies she ate on both days. 
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can find the difference in the number of cookies they ate. 
Difference in cookies = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister. 
Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, we can find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the total number of animals Rick killed is 10 + 15 + 36 = 61.

The final answer is 61."
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. 
4 times 3 is 12. 
12 plus 6 is 18.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is 84."
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. After adding 2 cows, each stall now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8. 

22 * 8 = 176

The final answer is: 176"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

- 100 pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 * $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate from the total weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books:
8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee:
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy owes the library a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52. 

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

The final answer is 128."
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:
66 cookies / 12 = 5.5

So, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300.

Two thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $0.62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she already had (5 boxes * 50 marbles per box) to the marbles she got from her friend (20 marbles).

First, let's calculate the marbles she already had: 5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Then, we add the marbles she got from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much all three girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each of them has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6 windows per house. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12 windows.

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows. 12 + 8 = 20 windows.

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. We can subtract these from the total number of stitches to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes.

Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Total stitches for the whole sweater = 1800 stitches.

So, the number of stitches for each sleeve = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Each sleeve takes 630 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, we can represent their current ages as x and y. 

We can write the equation: x + y = 20

Since we want to find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both of their current ages. 

So, in 10 years, their ages will be (x + 10) and (y + 10). 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since we know that x + y = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation: 
x + y + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. So, the total number of spots is (40 * 70) + (60 * 35) = 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, the total number of people is 15 + 30 = 45. 

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Since they doubled the number of stories in the second week, we need to multiply the number of stories they wrote in the first week by 2.

120 * 2 = 240

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether in the second week is 240.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 120 (first week) + 240 (second week) = 360 stories."

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to get the number of 5-star rows. 
40 / 5 = 8.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry. 

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 6000 / 2000 = 3.

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have in total. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. 

So, 39 = 10 * (x - 10)

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

39 = 10x - 100

10x = 139

x = 13.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a medal, we can round down to 13.9 to 13 (as you can't give out a fraction of a medal).

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of 10-minute intervals she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. 

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she completes. 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * 5 = 75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the information given.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 

15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

Since he sold 20 crates over the weekend, we need to add those to the total as well. 

45 + 20 = 65 crates

Now, we need to subtract the total number of crates sold from his target of 120 crates to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250. 
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300. 
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $200, $250, and $300. 

The total amount she paid is $200 + $250 + $300 = $750.

The desk costs her $750."
"To find the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven in a week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven in a year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven in a year = 15000 miles
Total cost for miles driven = 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

Total cost for the year = Total cost for miles driven + Total bonus = $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how much he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this case, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 16 pieces for the left side and 16 pieces for the right side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she brought.

Annika brought $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90 books.

The total number of books she has is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books she has sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year, the total number of books she sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135 books.

Now, we know that she sold 135 books in the first two years, and we also know that she sold 200 books in total. So, the number of books she sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the first year is 90 * 20 = 1800$.

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900$.

The total amount of money she earned in the first two years is 1800 + 900 = 2700$.

The final answer is: 2700"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month. 

First, we calculate his daily earnings: 
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April are:
$2000 + $300 = $2300

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people.

20% of 20 is 0.2 * 20 = 4.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales: 
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening: 
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight loss per week.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight by the weight loss per week.

Since we don't know the total weight, let's assume it's x pounds. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we can set up the equation:

x / 2 = 4

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 8

Now that we know the total weight is 8 pounds, we can find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we divide 15 by 3 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra arm: 15 / 3 = 5. This means the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we divide 15 by 5 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra leg: 15 / 5 = 3. This means the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, making a total of 5 + 3 = 8 new limbs.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to this gives us $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams should equal 105. 

We can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7: D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. We know that the total number of pencils Jam has is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

Now, let's solve for x: 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box is 8, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 
3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26

Now, let's add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is:

5 ice cubes * 13 degrees/ice cube = 65 degrees

Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can say that the coffee is now at 0 degrees (assuming it was initially at room temperature, which is around 20-25 degrees). 

Now, let's calculate the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since each added liquid weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, the total weakening effect is:

15 milliliters * 12 milliliters/milliliter = 180 milliliters

However, we need to consider that the coffee is now 65 degrees cooler, which means it has been diluted by 65 milliliters (since it was initially 0 degrees and is now 65 degrees cooler). To find the actual weakening effect, we need to divide the total weakening effect by the dilution factor:

180 milliliters / 65 milliliters = 2.77 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 2.77 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 2.77"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got and then work backwards to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can divide the total number of new records by the number of people to find out how many new records each person got on average.

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we can divide the number of new records each person got by 2 to find out how many old records they brought in.

1.4 new records / 2 = 0.7 old records per person

Now, we multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records they brought in.

0.7 old records per person * 5 people = 3.5 old records

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we round down to the nearest whole number.

3.5 old records ≈ 3 old records

The 5 people brought in approximately 3 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

At the second stop, 7 people got down, so we subtract those from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 20 - 7 = 13.

Then, 8 more people got on at the second stop, so we add those to the result: 13 + 8 = 21.

Now, we know that 5 people got on at the first stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we subtract the number of people who got on at the first stop from the result: 21 - 5 = 16.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since each reward is $1 off, they get 4 * $1 = $4 off.

Next, the customer applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. This means the new price is 150% of the original price, or 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The value of Maria's shares after the first year is 8 shares * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price is 75% of the previous year's price, or 0.75 times the previous year's price. So, the new price is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

The value of Maria's shares after the second year is 8 shares * $9 = $72.

"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we know John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200. So, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has. 

Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can represent the number of cows as 'x' and the number of chickens as '2x'. 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60. 

Solving for x, we get 3x = 60, which means x = 20. 

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens. 

Now, we need to find the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. 

The total number of legs is (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160. 

The final answer is 160."
"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to calculate how many balls he added to his act over the four weeks. 

He started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. So, after 4 weeks, he would have 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.

However, he dropped 3 balls, and 2 of them were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

So, Josh starts with 6 balls and loses 1, resulting in 6 - 1 = 5 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal. 

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

The container weighs 20 pounds. So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
She received twice that amount at the baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

Now, let's add all the outfits together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

Laurel has 87 outfits for her baby."
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day after taking his coach's advice and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. So, he will now run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

The tables with 4 legs have 40 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 40 * 4 = 160.

The tables with 3 legs have 50 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 50 * 3 = 150.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly costs of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100

Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: 6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities: 
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to first calculate the total number of plant pots she needs for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since this is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract that from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees. So, the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.

The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gives him an extra $10. So, Dean now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is 1 * $5 = $5.

The cost of riding the go-karts twice is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $25 = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

So, Morgan can invite $60 / $10 = 6 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from the total amount of money she receives.

Marisa gets $5 per day, which is equivalent to 500 cents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops is 4 x 25 = 100 cents.

Now, let's subtract the amount she spends from the total amount she receives: 500 - 100 = 400 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 400 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 400 ÷ 100 = 4 dollars.

So, Marisa puts $4 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy Billy bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is $1.5x.

Since Billy had $8 initially and spent $2 on gumballs, he must have spent $8 - $2 = $6 on candy. So, we can set up the equation: $1.5x = $6.

To find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide both sides of the equation by $1.5: x = $6 / $1.5 = 4.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we can solve for x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x
50 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = x
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services for 20 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Then, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for each part of the trip:
Total time = 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours

The trip took 8.86 hours."
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know that there are 43 girls and 96 students in total. Since 5 girls were absent, the number of girls present is 43 - 5 = 38.

Now, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students: 96 - 43 = 53.

Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present is 53 - 4 = 49.

The final answer is 49."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2 since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

And the number of people kicked out for physical violence:

3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14.

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost. 
   - 20% of $20 is $4.
   - So, the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost

The total hours Hallie had dance practice per week is 7 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 40% of x, which is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

Total amount spent = Number of functioning pieces * Price per piece
400,000 = (x - 0.4x) * Price per piece

Since we don't know the price per piece, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by x:

400,000 / x = 0.6 * Price per piece

However, we still can't find the price per piece without knowing the total number of pieces. But we can find the total amount spent on functioning pieces by finding the number of functioning pieces.

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= x - 0.4x
= 0.6x

Since we don't know the price per piece, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces in terms of x:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Price per piece
= 0.6x * Price per piece

We can't find the exact amount without knowing the price per piece, but we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces in terms of x.

However, we can find the total amount spent on functioning pieces if we know the price per piece. Let's assume the price per piece is y. Then:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x * y

To find the value of x, we need more information. But we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces in terms of x and y.

If we know the price per piece, we can find the total amount spent on functioning pieces.

For example, if the price per piece is $1000, then:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x * 1000
= 600x

If x = 400,000 / 0.6
= 666,667

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 600 * 666,667
= $400,000

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel initially had and the number of cookies Janet gave her: 
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Then, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate: 
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to find the total interest. The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to find the monthly payment. Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we can divide the total interest by the number of months:

Monthly payment = Total interest / Number of months
Monthly payment = $1,825 / 5
Monthly payment = $365

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $365."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Distance difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Total silver = Axel's silver + Anna's silver = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold = Axel's gold + Anna's gold = 80 + 120 = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, the total hours she spends running the stand is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit. 

Total revenue - initial cost = $36 - $18 = $18

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours spent running the stand. 

$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is $2."
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"To find the initial number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the initial number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 29. Half of 29 is 14.5, but since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the number of people who can't make it is 14. The number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15. 

The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers (3), which is 29."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the test scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Total number of messages = 66 + 22 = 88

The final answer is 88."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying individual tickets and the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of buying individual tickets for 9 rides is 9 * 2 * $2 = $18.

The cost of buying a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any individual tickets. 

So, David saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, this means David actually spends more money by buying the ride bracelet.

The correct answer is $12."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

First, let's add up the total number of gifts: 6 (for her family) + 4 (for her friends) + 2 (for her teachers) = 12 gifts.

Now, we'll divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12):

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

12"
"To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11). 

First, we find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15. 

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for each person: 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 
90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each will be $8 per month. 
So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34 per month.

So, Tim saves $34 per month by canceling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can add up the total work time:
- Writing time: 240 minutes
- Recording time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes (since it's half of 240 minutes)
- Editing time: 90 minutes

Total work time: 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to that gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

So, Wendy will need 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3."

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

First, we calculate the total number of days he works in a month: 
4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a month by 12:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

The builder earns $14,400 in a year."
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch, and Mark is making 4 batches, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we do the same thing. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch, and Mark is making 4 batches, so he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the energy used per day: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours)

Now, we multiply this by 30 days: 
7.2 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Next, we calculate the energy used per day after reducing the usage by 5 hours: 
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Now, we multiply this by 30 days: 
2.7 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 
216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours = 135 kilowatt-hours

The answer is 135."
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes:

- A zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.
- A zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is:
$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

"To find the initial number of corns, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since there are 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so the new total of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 100 + 60 = 160."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before the jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive at the airport 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 
1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. 
The remaining employees in June are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. 
The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means she pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound. 

Cost of the first pound: $3
Cost of the second pound: $3 * 0.5 = $1.5
Total cost of taffy: $3 + $1.5 = $4.5

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. 

Cost of seashells: $1.50
Cost of magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of seashells and magnets: $1.50 + $1 = $2.50

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets: 
$4.5 + $2.50 = $7

Sally started with $10. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:
$10 - $7 = $3

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

Now, we need to find the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes. Since the problem doesn't provide the probability of a candle exploding, we can assume that the probability of a candle exploding is independent of its smell. However, we can still find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode by multiplying the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the probability of a candle exploding.

Since we don't have the probability of a candle exploding, we can't calculate the exact number. However, we can express the expected number as a percentage of the total number of candles that smell like wet dog.

Expected number = 2500 * (probability of exploding)

Since we don't have the probability, we can't provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume that the probability of a candle exploding is the same as the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog (5%), then:

Expected number = 2500 * 0.05 = 125

So, approximately 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final answer is 125."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discounted price of one blouse and then multiply it by 4.

The regular price of one blouse is $20. Since the blouses are 30% off, we need to find 30% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Discounted price of one blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Now, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost of the 4 blouses:

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the second equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

For the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 kilometers.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

3. Then, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the cats that ran away from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 18 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The last 18 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the last 18 months is 18 * $14 = $252.

Now, we add up the costs for all three parts: $48 + $96 + $252 = $396.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $396."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole saved a total of $6 from both jeans. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is (1/3)x. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the savings, came from the tattered jeans. This 2/3 of the savings is equal to the difference in price between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, which is (x + 6) - x = 6.

Now, we can set up the equation: (2/3)x = 6. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us x = 9.

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $9. The original price of the tattered jeans is $9 + 6 = $15.

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds."
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, he sold 2/3x cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he made from selling the cards is 2/3x * $1.5. 

We know that this amount, plus the $50 he already had, equals the cost of the amusement park ticket, which is $100. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2/3x * $1.5 + $50 = $100.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 1x + $50 = $100.

Subtracting $50 from both sides, we get: 1x = $50.

Dividing both sides by 1, we get: x = 50.

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the money she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dragons each prince slew and then determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon to get the total pints needed. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up an equation to find the total amount of money he had initially.

Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as x. We know that 1% of x is 380 cents. So, we can write the equation as 0.01x = 380.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.01: x = 380 / 0.01 = 38000.

Now that we know George had $38 in total, we can find out how much he spent on candy bars. Since he spent $5 in total and $38 was his initial amount, he spent 38 - 5 = 33 cents on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars he bought: 33 / 75 = 0.44. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, George bought 0 candy bars."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Rory and her mom each have 1 piece, so 2 pieces are taken.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the taken pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 2 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, so the total number of people is 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling effect is 30 / 10 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase: 15 - 6 = 9 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the cost of the hay as follows: 
Cost of hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail 
Cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * 3 
Cost of hay = 24 dollars 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 

Now, we can calculate the change he has after buying the hay: 
Change = Total money - Cost of hay 
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars 
Change = 6 dollars

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of a regular movie ticket as x and the price of a regular popcorn as y.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $12 + $1 (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $16.

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $12 + y + $3 = $15 + y.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + y = $16 - $2
$15 + y = $14

Now, we can solve for y:

y = $14 - $15
y = -$1

However, the price of popcorn cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $15 + y is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If you bought the super ticket, you paid $16. If you bought the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately, you paid $12 + y + $3 = $15 + y. Since you saved $2, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together must be $16 - $2 = $14.

Now, we can set up the equation:

$12 + y + $3 = $14

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost of filling 1 balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $900 / 20
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $45

Now, the cost of filling one balloon increased by $20. 

New cost of filling 1 balloon = Original cost + Increase
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $45 + $20
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost of filling 1 balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, and Nancy eats 4 apples per day.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length x width x height = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first find the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards)
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow)
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 3700 / 2250 = 1.65.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

She earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. 

In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. 

Since she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students, she gives 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students. 

If each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given to the students by 10 to find out how many students she has. 

300 / 10 = 30 

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
Total cost = Number of apples * Price per apple
Total cost = 20 * 0.45
Total cost = 9 dollars

Becky received a $1 discount, so the final amount she paid = Total cost - Discount
Final amount Becky paid = 9 - 1
Final amount Becky paid = 8 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
Total cost = Number of apples * Price per apple
Total cost = 20 * 0.50
Total cost = 10 dollars

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
Discount = 10% of 10 dollars
Discount = 0.10 * 10
Discount = 1 dollar

Final amount Kelly paid = Total cost - Discount
Final amount Kelly paid = 10 - 1
Final amount Kelly paid = 9 dollars

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid.
Difference = Final amount Kelly paid - Final amount Becky paid
Difference = 9 - 8
Difference = 1 dollar

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * 240 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras and divide it by the shark's body length.

First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The total length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The total cost of the trip is $15,400."

Gabriel has 20 songs, so Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player. Since his player can store up to 100 songs, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add. 

80 (Gabriel's addable songs) - 60 (Luri's songs) = 20

The answer is 20."
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of oranges picked, which is 60.

2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson gave up $24.

"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

First, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days per week: 
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we divide the total miles per week by the miles per hour to find the total hours per week:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, the total amount of oats consumed by one horse in a day is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to feed his horses. He needs to feed them for 5 days.

The total amount of oats needed for 5 days is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. 

Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. 

Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = 18. 

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. 

One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = 6. 

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures:

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount.

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors and then subtract the discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors without the discount. 
2 packs * $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 3 razors for $8.00. 
So, the cost of 3 razors is $8.00.

Now, let's subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost of 3 razors. 
$8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00

Since we have 3 razors, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the cost of each individual razor. 
$6.00 / 3 = $2.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 
$2.00 * 100 = 200 cents

The final answer is 200."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, so she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The human pyramid is 48 feet tall."
"To find the total minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the number of times she got up and walked in 5 days. 

Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she walks 24 times in 5 days. 

24 hours * 5 days = 120 hours

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, we multiply the total hours by 5 minutes:

120 hours * 5 minutes/hour = 600 minutes

Charisma walked 600 minutes in 5 days."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. 

Since in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we can write the equation as: 
A + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To find out how many oranges Brianne and Ashley have in total, we need to calculate the number of oranges each of them brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. 

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43. 

The equation can be written as: B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms: 
3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides: 
3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3: 
B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: 
David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: 
Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

First, we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator. Since 1/4 is the same as 2/8, and 1/2 is the same as 4/8, we can add them together.

2/8 + 4/8 = 6/8

Since there are 8 eighths in a whole, we can convert 6/8 to a whole by dividing 6 by 8, which equals 0.75. 

So, they used 0.75 skeins of yarn altogether. 

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 0.75 by 364 to find the total yards used.

0.75 * 364 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and then add them together.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood: 
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 wood to get the most popsicle sticks for his money.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks he can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = 4

Total sticks from 2 x 8 wood = 4 * 400 sticks
Total sticks = 1600 sticks

The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep from both locations: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."

"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 105,000 / 181 ≈ 578 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 578 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up an equation: 

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3 * Lot cost + Lot cost = 120,000
4 * Lot cost = 120,000

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot:
Lot cost = 120,000 / 4
Lot cost = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:
House cost = 3 * 30,000
House cost = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."

3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total vlogs she aims to make: 
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 / 15 days (first half of April) = $75 per day

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 * 2 = $150 per day

So, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of April to hit his target.

$150"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * 0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work. 

Distance from home to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her actions:

1. She writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * 1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his initial $70. 
$70 - $20 = $50

He has $50 left. Since he spent $6 on plastic action figures, he has $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Since plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can divide $44 by $2 to find out how many he can buy. 
$44 / $2 = 22

So, Peter will have 22 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures. 
22 (plastic) + 4 (wooden) = 26

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses the shops order in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 20 * 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 15 * 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

Total roses ordered by all shops in a month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses ordered by the shops: 
260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in that time period.

Since she removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

Total amount removed = $100 * 24
Total amount removed = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her account.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide by the number of days.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.
5. The resulting value from step 3 is multiplied by the result from step 4: 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

So, they have 7 cards together."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520. 

To do this, we multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 1 + 0.04): 
520 * 1.04 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 90 minutes. 
The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses. 
Combined value = Herb's house value + Juan's house value 
= $76,000 + $53,200 
= $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups, and she bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.
The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100 - (10% of $100) = $100 - $10 = $90

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90 * 2 = $180

Since there are 90 contacts in 1 box, there are 90 * 2 = 180 contacts in 2 boxes.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours worked by the hourly wage of $10.
Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.
John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.
$70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 times 100 ml, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

First, we need to find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words from 52 WPM to the third measurement. 

Third measurement = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add the three measurements together: 
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
So, in 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
So, in 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight after 5 weeks will be 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

Initially, Alex invited 100 people. Each of them invited 2 friends, so the number of additional people invited is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of additional people invited from her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the initial number of people invited, the additional people invited from her friends, and the additional people invited from her friends' spouses: 
100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex needs 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it's taller than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents. 
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents. 
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents. 
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Adding all the values together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy. 
345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 34."
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of this amount, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 
Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tires will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4366.67 years

The tire will last approximately 4367 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt is 30% off, so we multiply the price by 0.3 to find the discount amount: 
$25 * 0.3 = $7.50

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt: 
$25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as follows:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost: 
$52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't spend a negative amount, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $6.70.

The final answer is -6.70."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to add the growth in each week.

The beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week.
It doubled in height the second week, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.
In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so the total height is 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. 

Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the entire bull.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of seats, we first need to find the total number of rows and seats. 

There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. 
Total number of seats = 4 * 18 = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats. 
Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. 
Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole and 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy sessions.

Since John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate how many pieces he chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he chews at school and at home: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he gave away from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

Then, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. 

So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour. 

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

Now, let's subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year.

Now, let's divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years.

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
= 4/5 * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed.

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. 

time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

So, Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from it.

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $600. 

Let's assume he misses x classes. Then, the total cost will be:
Total cost = (10 - x) * $60

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.
(10 - x) * $60 <= $600

Now, let's solve for x:
(10 - x) * 60 <= 600
10 * 60 - x * 60 <= 600
600 - 60x <= 600
-60x <= 0
x >= 0

Since x represents the number of classes, it cannot be negative. So, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production is the sum of Julie's and Jewel's daily production: 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 7 * 150 = 1050 customers.

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck: 
$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,000.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,000."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary, so it's $20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: $372000"

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 * $30 = $600

Now, we calculate the 10% discount:
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60

The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

The negative sign indicates that Clara paid less than Sheila."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats can be represented as G/2.

We know that the total sales of red hats in the first month is $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 800

Now that we know the sales of green hats, we can calculate the total sales of the first month:

Total sales of the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month can be calculated as:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales of the first month
= 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, we can calculate the total amount Ariadne made in two months:

Total amount = Total sales of the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, then add them together.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then add them together.

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of the more expensive coffee = Cost of the normal coffee + (20% of the cost of the normal coffee)
= $5 + (0.20 * $5)
= $5 + $1
= $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

Cost of the coffee = 7 pounds * $6 per pound
= $42

Now, we add the cost of the donut to the cost of the coffee:

Total cost = Cost of the coffee + Cost of the donut
= $42 + $2
= $44

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:
- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
- Bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- Bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of items: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of items) = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours John spends in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

If they decide to share the money equally among themselves, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes.

Adding the extra 5 minutes for the tie, the total game length is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by the number of muffins.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add the total amount of each ingredient: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy they will have in total, we need to add the amount of candy each of them had. 

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Now, to find out how much each of them will have if they share it equally, we divide the total amount by 3.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each of them will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the first 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The remaining 10 days were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the updated count of good days is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the initial height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs, so he needed 8 more toys. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.

When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so there were 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. However, 3 dogs were gone, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs now.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we calculate 2/5 of $1200.
   2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.
   1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We calculate 2/3 of 720.
   2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find the amount Skyler invested.
   720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 + 44 = 64

They already have 64 signatures. 

Now, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect to reach 100. 

100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato. 

First, we find the number of hash browns per potato: 
36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Now, we multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes: 
6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the total weight of the 9 adults exceeds the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up all the cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 68 + 5 = 73.

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies: 73 - 12 = 61.

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the Cookie Monster's cookies: 61 + 23 = 84.

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can add them up to find the total number of cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 84 = 286.

The total number of cookies is 286."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20 
1.5x = 120 
x = 120 / 1.5 
x = 80 

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. 

In ""rabbit"" mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in both modes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be positive integers.

Let's try different values of y. If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

Now, let's add up the time John has for homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4).

$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost.

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in 10 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 10 = 120 months in 10 years. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 10 years, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 10 years, Neil saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines + heartworm check). 
Let's denote the total bill as T. 
T = vaccines + heartworm check
T = $40 + 0.6T
0.4T = $40
T = $100

Now we know the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * $100 = $60. 
The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 
John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.

Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68.

The total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 square foot = 68 square feet."
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs needed.

8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there are 57 people attending (42 adults + 15 babies), and Mia only has 48 chairs, she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 14 people, we can divide 14 by 5 (2+3) to find out how many sets of drinks and snacks are needed. 14 / 5 = 2.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of a set, we'll round up to 3 sets.

So, 3 sets of drinks and snacks are needed. Each set costs $2, so 3 sets will cost 3 x $2 = $6.

Therefore, the group spent $6 on snacks and drinks."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of all three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. So, the total number of dumplings cooked is 32 + 18 = 50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5 since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 = 2

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 32% = 68%.

The final answer is 68."
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks of tutoring would be 14 * 12 = $168.

$168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. 

The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10): $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final bill is $45.00."
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she has $6.00, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin gets 2 scoops for free. 

Since she can afford 4 scoops, she can buy 3 sets of the deal (3 scoops for $4.50, and 1 scoop is free). 

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days (two weeks), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24. 

24 * 24 = 576 

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

Cost of picking blueberries: 
- Initial cost: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Total cost of blueberries: $20 + (30 pounds * $1.5/pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound: $2.5
- Total cost of blueberries: 30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Now, let's find out how much James saved:
- Savings: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = original price + increase
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers.

Total amount = number of computers * new price of each computer
= 500 * $770
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories, so the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet has 2 oz of cheese, and each oz of cheese is 120 calories, so the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet has an equal amount of ham, which is 2 oz, and each oz of ham is 40 calories, so the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham together: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The total calories in the omelet are 770.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the buckets of asphalt plus the fine he'll get fined for doing it himself. 

Cost of asphalt = 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
Fine for unauthorized road maintenance = $120

Total cost of fixing the pothole = $75 + $120 = $195

The potential damage to his car is $450. 

Money saved by fixing the pothole = Potential damage to the car - Total cost of fixing the pothole

20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, let's subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 people, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, that's 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. 4/3 pizzas is equivalent to 4 and 1/3 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 4 and 1/3 pizzas is 16 and 1/3 slices. So, Bryce and two friends ate 16 and 1/3 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, that's 2 * ¾ = 3/2 pizzas. 3/2 pizzas is equivalent to 1 and 1/2 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 1 and 1/2 pizzas is 6 and 1/2 slices. So, the two remaining friends ate 6 and 1/2 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices that were eaten: 16 and 1/3 + 6 and 1/2. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. So, we convert 16 and 1/3 to 32/3 and 6 and 1/2 to 13/2. Now we can add: 32/3 + 13/2 = (32*2 + 13*3) / 6 = (64 + 39) / 6 = 103/6. 

103/6 is equivalent to 17 and 1/6. So, a total of 17 and 1/6 slices were eaten.

Now, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 17 and 1/6. To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. So, we convert 60 to 360/6. Now we can subtract: 360/6 - 17/6 - 1/6 = 342/6 = 57.

The answer is 57."
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

So, the equation becomes: 9x + 10 = 100

To solve for 'x', we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Then, we divide both sides by 9:
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last by the number of days he chews per pack.

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we can assume that he will go through 4 pieces per day. 

Now, we divide the total number of days (30) by the number of pieces he chews per day (4):

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, we multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, we multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, we add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age

There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 2 weeks is 10 days. So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in 2 weeks is 60 * 5 * 2 = 600.

There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 2 weeks is 4 days. So, the number of chairs rented during weekends in 2 weeks is 100 * 2 * 4 = 800.

Now, we add the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends: 600 + 800 = 1400.

The total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 1400.

1400"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of bananas at each step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther had 48 / 2 = 24 bananas left.

Then, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity per year and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost of electricity per year is:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the total cost by 4:
$1200 / 4 = $300

So each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he sent, and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Initial glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Broken glasses: 10
Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the initial trade and 60 small buttons from the second trade, for a total of 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons.

She also has 20 large buttons.

So, Lorraine has 87 small buttons and 20 large buttons by the end.

The final answer is 107."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount you'll pay after the discount, you need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, you'll pay $133 after the discount."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists = 20
Number of songs in each playlist = 300
Length of each song = 10 hours

Total number of songs = 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours = 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we first need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win and how many people think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find out how many people are remaining after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we know that the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - People who think horse #2 will win - People who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. So, if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of girls. 

3 * 6 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies. Let's say the total number of puppies is x. Then, 2/3 of x is equal to 18 (the number of Pomeranians). 

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * 3/2
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

The first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, which is 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases.

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2 * 125 = 250 cases.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Now, we add the 90 extra pears to the number of bananas: 
200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 fruits

George has 290 fruits."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the total amount of money she had. 

First, we subtract the cost of the ball ($20) from the total amount of money she had ($80). 

$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we divide the remaining amount ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5) to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges required for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read. 

300 + 150 = 450

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, but this doesn't change the total number of books they read altogether.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450."
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day, so:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day, so:
$30 + $5 = $35

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 + $35 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make: 135 - 60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the money he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): 75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."

For the cars, Henry needs 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
For the motorcycles, Henry needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Total wheels needed = 228 wheels for cars + 146 wheels for motorcycles = 374 wheels.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels available:

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we know the cost of the movies in series is $6 each, and the cost of the older movies is $5 each. We also know the cost of a normal movie is $10.

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * 10
= $2000

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the movies in series and the cost of the older movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies
= $2000 + $800
= $2800

The final answer is: $2800"

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows: 
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour. 
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 miles per hour). We can use the formula: 
Distance = Speed * Time. 
Distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earned.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's say x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) white fish. We are told that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out of the tank. 

Now, we know that 4 orange fish were taken out, and 17 - 4 = 13 white fish were taken out. 

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 13 white fish, Bob had 4 - 13 = -9 white fish, but again, we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the 13 white fish taken out must be incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the equation.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out of the tank.

Now, we know that 4 orange fish were taken out, and 17 - 4 = 13 white fish were taken out. 

However, we know that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of white fish must be half the number of orange fish. 

Let's set up the equation:

Number of white fish = Number of orange fish / 2

We know that the number of white fish is 4 - 13 = -9, but again, we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the 13 white fish taken out must be incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the equation.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

Number of white fish = Number of orange fish / 2

We know that the number of white fish is 4 - (17 - x). We also know that the number of orange fish is 3 - x.

So, we can set up the equation:

4 - (17 - x) = (3 - x) / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4 - 17 + x = (3 - x) / 2

Combine like terms:

-13 + x = (3 - x) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

-26 + 2x = 3 - x

Add x to both sides:

-26 + 3x = 3

Add 26 to both sides:

3x = 29

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 29/3

x is not a whole number, which means that the initial assumption that the number of white fish taken out is 13 is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the equation.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4 - 17 + x = (3 - x) / 2

Combine like terms:

-13 + x = (3 - x) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

-26 + 2x = 3 - x

Add x to both sides:

-26 + 3x = 3

Add 26 to both sides:

3x = 29

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 29/3

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy uses his car from Monday to Friday, he travels 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles.

Now, we can divide the total distance by his car's fuel efficiency to find out how much gas he uses per week: 25 miles / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons.

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can multiply the amount of gas used by the price per gallon to find the total cost: 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50.

So, Andy's car is consuming $7.50 per week.

7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount Carrie paid for lunch is $155."
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trip that John needs to cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school is covering half of this amount, so John needs to cover the other half, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

John already has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs: $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups: 
90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each group had 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and the number of seashells each member brought:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells.

The final answer is 108."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Then, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 bottle caps * $0.25 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20, so for 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. So, for the additional 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

In total, Jamie was paid $160 + $90 = $250 for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 

12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions and lion cubs. 

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After the first month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220.
After the second month, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240.
After the third month, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to employees after three months will be:
- Month 1: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
- Month 2: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000
- Month 3: 260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

The total amount paid to employees after three months is $880,000 + $960,000 + $1,040,000 = $2,880,000."
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so singing it twice will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so singing it once will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours of work, Sally's total earnings will be: 
$10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 
3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's say she buys x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / ( 14 + x ) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by ( 14 + x ) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3( 14 + x )

Now, distribute 0.3 to both terms inside the parentheses:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate x:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of square inches he can make with one bag by the number of bags he has. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and each bag has 72 chips, we can calculate the number of square inches per bag as follows: 
72 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 6 square inches per bag.

Now, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by the number of bags: 
6 square inches per bag * 2 bags = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we can calculate the length of the mosaic as follows: 
12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. There were 10 quarts left, so the initial amount is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."

The total number of petals in the vase is 101."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to find out how many marshmallows are left after dropping 3. 

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3, so they have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

Now, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left for each S'more. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they have 32 - 18 = 14 marshmallows left.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can make, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are 2 kids). 

14 / 2 = 7

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter = $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 0.5 quarters = $0.25 * 0.5 = $0.125. Since there are three friends, the total cost for them is 3 * $0.125 = $0.375.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $0.25 + $0.375 = $0.625.

The final answer is: $0.625"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, which gives us S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, which gives us 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combine like terms: 8Z + G = 10.

We don't know the exact value of G, but we can express it in terms of Z. Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and we know the amounts of S, O, F, and Z, we can find the amount of G.

Since S = 2Z, O = 4Z, and F = Z, the total amount of S, O, F, and Z is 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z = 8Z.

So, G = 10 - 8Z.

Now, we need to find the value of Z. Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and we know the amounts of S, O, F, and Z, we can set up an equation using the given information.

We know that S = 2Z, O = 4Z, F = Z, and G = 10 - 8Z. Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + (10 - 8Z) = 10

Combine like terms: 8Z + 10 - 8Z = 10

Simplify the equation: 10 = 10

This equation is true for any value of Z, but we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Since the amounts of S, O, F, and Z are 2Z, 4Z, Z, and Z, respectively, the total amount of the mixture is 8Z + (10 - 8Z) = 10.

"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which is 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Converting this to minutes, we multiply by 60.

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to get the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that time: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find the difference, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

Becca has 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the cost of shipping the book is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the cost of shipping the book is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total cost of shipping the book is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund will be 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since Milly has to pay the shipping cost of $3.00, she will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$21.

However, since Milly is losing money, we can say she will lose $21.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes, or 6 hours, doing her makeup in a month.

Now, let's add the time she spends on recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup: 72 + 8 + 6 = 86 hours.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to start with the information about Eva. 

Eva has saved $20.00.

Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 is 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. 
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of one turtle is:

Speed of one turtle = Speed of one kangaroo / 2
Speed of one turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of one turtle = 3 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for them to travel across the highway is:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
We don't know the total distance, but we can use the fact that 3 kangaroos can travel it in 18 hours. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the speed of the kangaroo to find the distance:

Distance = Speed of one kangaroo * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the total time it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
Total time = 108 hours / 3 turtles
Total time = 36 hours

However, we need to consider that there are four turtles, so we need to multiply the time by 4:

Total time = 36 hours * 4
Total time = 144 hours

Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, 144 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how many clay dishes they all make together, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know how much. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 (the price of the laptop after trading in her old one) plus $50 (the remaining amount she needs). 

So, we can set up the equation: x + $150 + $80 = $400 + $50

Combine the constants on the left side: x + $230 = $450

Now, subtract $230 from both sides: x = $220

Therefore, Erika has $220 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so he had 3 x 5 = 15 large apple slices.

He also had 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 small apple slices.

In total, Adam had 15 + 15 = 30 apple slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract 15 from 30: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, Adam has 15 apple slices left.

15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow per day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow to find out the number of cows needed.

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs.

15 - 3 = 12

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and then add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts together: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
Total amount Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items he wants to buy = $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Now, let's subtract the total amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks, we add the number of dishes and socks together.

60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

So, Brenda will have $1615.28 after 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75. 
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. 
However, we get $2 off for each basket of red food, so we subtract $6 from the total cost of the red food. 
The total cost of the red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48. 
The total cost of the green food and the discounted red food is $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the total time it would take to clean all the rooms and then divide that by 2.

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. 

Total time to clean all rooms = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2.

Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 15 hours

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my brother's age is B, my age is B - 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is B - 3 - 2 = B - 5.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3B - 1.
4. The sum of our ages is 87, so (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87.

Now, let's solve the equation:
B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87
Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87
Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96
Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number (you can't be a fraction of a year old), this is a problem. However, we can try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the conditions.

Let's try B = 19:
My age is 19 - 3 = 16.
My sister's age is 19 - 5 = 14.
My mom's age is 3(19) - 1 = 56.
The sum of our ages is 16 + 14 + 56 = 86, which is close to 87.

Since we can't find an exact solution, we can try B = 20:
My age is 20 - 3 = 17.
My sister's age is 20 - 5 = 15.
My mom's age is 3(20) - 1 = 59.
The sum of our ages is 17 + 15 + 59 = 91, which is too high.

Since B = 19 is the closest whole number, we can assume that my brother is 19 years old. 

My age is 16.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, she raised 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since each box makes 10 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per box to find out how many boxes he needs:

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

First, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we need to find 3/5 of the total pieces.

3/5 * 60 = (3 * 60) / 5 = 180 / 5 = 36

So, 36 pieces were left after the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's subtract these from the remaining pieces.

36 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate, we need to multiply 7/13 by 26.

(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.

26 - 14 = 12

So, Tobias has eaten 2 + 10 + 14 = 26 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be 16 * $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00.

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate. 

We know she earned $33 for 3 hours, so we can divide $33 by 3 to find her hourly rate: 
$33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work (12 hours) to find her total earnings:
$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had (52) to the marbles his friend gave him (28). 
52 + 28 = 80

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend. 
1/4 of 80 is 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost (20) from the total marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend (80). 
80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To find out how much money Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he will make from selling 3/5 of his chickens at $50 per chicken.

3/5 of 300 chickens is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

The total amount of money Isaias will make from selling 180 chickens is 180 * $50 = $9000.

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we need to subtract this from the total amount of money he will make: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

This means Isaias needs to make $7000 from selling 180 chickens to make a profit of $2000.

To find out how much he bought each chicken for, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($7000) by the number of chickens (180): $7000 / 180 = $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 1.5 * 20 = $30.

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's also 20 meters long. So, the total amount she has is 2 * 20 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she has: 40 - 30 = $10.

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's say in x years, her age will be thrice her present age. 

So, her age in x years will be 3 * 8 = 24.

Since her current age is 8, we need to find the difference between 24 and 8, which is 16.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 * 2 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, we know that each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly doesn't have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart.

The final answer is: $-91"
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime:

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were able to fit in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones could fit. 

Number of microphones that could fit = 80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that could fit by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

6 birds in the bushes * 2/3 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 birds in the groups

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups.

6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide 50 by 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then subtract the number of petals of the orchids from the number of petals of the daisies.

The total number of petals of the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.
The total number of petals of the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the number of petals of the orchids from the number of petals of the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, so the number of indoor plants is 100 * (1/4) = 25.

The remaining plants are outdoor plants. Since there are 100 - 25 = 75 plants left, two-thirds of them are outdoor plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we know that the remaining plants are flowering plants. The number of flowering plants is 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. 

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We also know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which totals $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she spends on carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find out how much she pays for one carrot, we divide the remaining amount by 2 (since she eats 2 carrots a day). $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. 

So, 6x + (amount from lemonade sales) = 80

We don't know the amount from lemonade sales yet, but we can express it as 'y'. 

6x + y = 80

We also know that the total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 8x. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn is x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6x. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 3x * $6 + 5x * $6 = 18x + 30x = 48x.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 48x + 6x = 54x.

Since the total amount she made is $80, we can set up the equation 54x + y = 80.

We know that 6x = 80 - y. 

Substituting 6x in the equation 54x + y = 80, we get 54(80 - y) + y = 80.

Expanding the equation, we get 4320 - 54y + y = 80.

Combine like terms, we get 4320 - 53y = 80.

Subtract 4320 from both sides, we get -53y = -4240.

Divide both sides by -53, we get y = 80.

The final answer is 80."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Then, 3x = 7 (since Martha had 3 times as many as Joseph)

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: 
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. 
Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2.33 notebooks. 
The difference is 7 - 2.33 = 4.67

The final answer is 4.67."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"

"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. To do that, we subtract Daniel's total pages from Denise's total pages: 18 - 13 = 5.

Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to find out how much soup is left after everyone eats dinner.

There are 4 adult bowls and 2 child bowls, so in total, 6 bowls are eaten for dinner. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can fill 6 bowls in total. This means there is 0 leftover soup.

However, since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, it can fill 6 bowls in total. This means there is 2 child bowls worth of soup left.

Since there are 2 child bowls left, and each child can have one bowl, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
So, the material needed for 1 small mask is 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yards.
For 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

For large masks: 
She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
So, the material needed for 1 large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yards.
For 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.

In total, Jo would need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, and there are 9 movies. So, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical eight-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

First, let's add up the total number of fruits Kira bought: 
3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Then, we subtract the number of fruits Lola ate: 
14 - 2 = 12

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each student bought 10 lollipops at $0.5 each, so the cost per student is 10 * $0.5 = $5. Since there are 30 students, the total cost is 30 * $5 = $150.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit: $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by that amount.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea and there are 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since the tea is divided into 3 rows, and the amount of mint tea in each row is equal, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

So, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips to get 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine how much water is in the tank initially. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount emptied from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. The total amount spent on snacks is $8 + $16 = $24.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. After spending $24 on snacks, he has $150 - $24 = $126 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday. So, he can spend up to $126 - $10 = $116 on movie tickets. 

Since Colby already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday. 

The answer is 1."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156
Total Junebugs removed on Thursday and Friday = 48 + 57 = 105
Total Junebugs removed in 5 days = 39 + 156 + 105 = 300

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:
P + A + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:
A = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:
P = A + J

Now we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute this expression for P into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + A + 10 = 100

Now we can substitute the second equation into this equation:
3J + (J + 10) + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total, including Maria, the additional balloons would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons to the additional balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of balloons the girls have is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so she spat a total of 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so she spat a total of 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance spat = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance spat = 820 / 2
Average total distance spat = 410

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $192,000

Now, let's find the difference in the total money made from both machines:
Difference = Total money from Widgeteer 3000 - Total money from WidgetMaster 9000
= $259,200 - $192,000
= $67,200

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The cost of these additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by 25. 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount she will get from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams, she has 6 and each costs $1.5, so 6 * $1.5 = $9.

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and each costs $2, so 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and each costs $1.25, so 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Adding the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance, we get 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Therefore, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake."
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, and Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored (x + 10) + 10 points, which is x + 20.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book has 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, we need to find out the total time she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and goes to sleep at 10 p.m., which is 10 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, the actual time she woke up is 5 minutes earlier than 6 a.m., which is 5:55 a.m.

Now, we need to find out the time she went to sleep. We know she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. So, the time she went to sleep is 2:15 a.m. - 5 hours = 9:15 p.m.

Now, we can calculate the total time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 9:15 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. So, the total time she was asleep is 8 hours and 40 minutes.

8 hours * 60 minutes = 480 minutes
40 minutes + 480 minutes = 520 minutes

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he initially has. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we need to convert 2 dozen to the number of cups. 

1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply 24 cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons.

24 * 2/3 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan initially had 24 cups and 16 measuring spoons. After gifting 6 measuring spoons, he has 24 cups and 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted will be:
50 * 14 = 700

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. 
Initial occupied beds + admitted beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, so the number of unoccupied beds will be:

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of corn chips each person would get if they were to be divided equally. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, we can start by finding the total number of corn chips they have together. 

70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) = 140

Since they want to divide the chips equally among three people, we need to divide 140 by 3. However, we know that one person will get 15 more chips than the others. This means that the person who gets 15 more chips will have 2 * (the number of chips the others get) + 15.

Let's call the number of chips the others get 'x'. Then, the person who gets 15 more chips will have 2x + 15.

We know that the total number of chips is 140, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (2x + 15) = 140

Combine like terms:

4x + 15 = 140

Subtract 15 from both sides:

4x = 125

Divide by 4:

x = 31.25

Since we can't divide chips into fractions, we'll round down to 31. This is the number of chips the others will get.

Now, we can find the number of chips the person who gets 15 more chips will have:

2 * 31 + 15 = 67

Now, we can find the total number of chips:

70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 67 (the person who gets 15 more) = 207

The total number of corn chips is 207."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

And we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation, we get:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339
A + 4A - 13 + S + 5 = 339
5A + S - 8 = 339

Now, we can substitute S = 4A - 13 into the equation:
5A + (4A - 13) - 8 = 339
9A - 21 = 339

Now, we can solve for A:
9A = 339 + 21
9A = 360
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we need to find the total time John will spend watching the show. We multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in this leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in this leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north for 2 hours, it means she is covering the distance she covered flying south for 10 hours. So, the net distance covered in the north is 36 miles.

Now, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in this leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

The total distance covered flying south is 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

Since the bird is flying south for 410 miles and north for 36 miles, the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at her office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home party.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home party.

Now, let's add these numbers together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. We need to subtract these from the total: 66 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

John paid a total of $2100 for the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.
2. Calculate the total number of oranges she gave away: 2 boxes to her mom + 2 boxes to her sister = 4 boxes. 4 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges.
3. Calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.
4. Calculate the number of oranges she sold: 240 (initial oranges) - 80 (given away) - 60 (kept) = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we need to find half of 50 first. 
Half of 50 is 25.

Now, we add 4 to 25 to get the number of states in India. 
25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to get the total number of states in both countries.
50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has $14 saved, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we can divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the price of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
He sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Saturday: 10 * $6 = $60 for gingerbread and 11 * $15 = $165 for apple pie. Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225.
- Sunday: 15 * $6 = $90 for gingerbread and 11 * $15 = $165 for apple pie. Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $165 = $255.

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $255 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

The price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

From the first statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be twice Emil's age at that time. So, D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother's age will be half of his dad's age at that time. So, B = D / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24.

Now, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, his brother is currently 24 - 5 = 19 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is D + B = 48 + 19 = 67.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band:
25% of the remaining students (excluding football players) = 25% of (30 - 6) = 25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between each plant from the total length of the bed. 

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. 
So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between it and the next plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the bed by the space taken up by each plant and the space between it and the next plant to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed.

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
27 * 6 = $162

The final answer is 162."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 9. 
So Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 
There are 7 days in a week. 
9 pretzels a day * 7 days = 63 pretzels.

Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she sets aside $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside by the cost of each pair of shoes. 

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp.

90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp. However, in this case, peeling and cooking are done in the same time frame, so we can simply add the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a variable 'x'. 
x - 14 degrees = Final temperature

The problem asks for the difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature. Since we don't know the initial temperature, we can represent the difference as:
x - (x - 14 degrees) = 14 degrees

The final answer is 14."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation: 
x + 75 = 3(30)

Simplifying the equation: 
x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides: 
x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes each month and then multiply it by 12.

1. He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 1 check per month.
2. He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 1 check per month.
3. He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 2 checks per month.
4. He writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks per month: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

Multiply the total number of checks per month by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks per year.

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22, and then divided by 2, which is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent:

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, there are 4 slices in total. Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes. 
Chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes = 64 / 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost, but since the question asks for the earnings, we should consider the total monthly cost as the earnings. 

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box. 

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

78"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth 
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4 
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. 

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48 
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed. 

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9 
Total gallons = 61980 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = Total gallons * 0.10 
Cost = 61980 * 0.10 
Cost = 6198 

The cost to fill the pool is $6198."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 91% of the initial charge (100% - 9% = 91%). 

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 93% of the charge remaining after 5 hours (100% - 7% = 93%). 

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x = 0.845x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. 

0.845x = 0.28

To find the initial charge, we divide both sides by 0.845:

x = 0.28 / 0.845
x = 0.333

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33.33%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage: $2,000 / $25 = 80 hours.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours: 80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the fruits he already purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by 18 pages to find the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The number of guests remaining is 61 - 30 = 31.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the total number of guests is 31 + 7 = 38.

The hotel now has 38 guests."

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many questions are easy and average/difficult. Since 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are divided equally between average and difficult, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:

Total questions = 60
Easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
Average and difficult questions = 60 - 24 = 36
Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 + 18 = 36.

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'L' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'S'. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total amount earned from the sales can be represented as:

$12L + $4S = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$12L + $4(2L) = $120
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in one week = 11 * 7 = 77

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs not found by the Smith twins is 100 - 60 = 40.

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 40 eggs.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment. Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate it as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.1 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios.

Scenario 1: The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension. The probability of this happening is 60% (100% - 40% chance of an extension). In this case, Marcus still has to turn in his homework, so the probability of this scenario is 0.6.

Scenario 2: The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension. The probability of this happening is 40%. In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework, so the probability of this scenario is 0.4.

Scenario 3: The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework. The probability of this happening is 50%. In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework, so the probability of this scenario is 0.5.

Now, we need to find the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework. We add the probabilities of the scenarios where he has to turn in his homework: 0.6 (normal teacher doesn't give an extension) + 0.4 (substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework) = 1.

However, we also need to consider the scenario where the substitute teacher comes in and Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment and gets an extension. The probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.5 (50% chance of the substitute teacher coming in) = 0.1.

Now, we add the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework: 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.1 = 1.1.

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we subtract the excess from 1: 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 90%.

The final answer is: 90%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first find out how many tickets are left after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to find the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Melissa is paid $15 per day and spends $3 on parking, so her daily earnings after expenses are:
$15 (daily pay) - $3 (parking) = $12 per day

Since she spends 3 days, her total earnings after expenses are:
$12 (daily earnings) * 3 (days) = $36

Now, we need to find out how many hours she works in 3 days. Since she spends 6 hours a day, her total hours worked are:
6 (hours per day) * 3 (days) = 18 hours

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her total earnings by the total hours worked:
$36 (total earnings) / 18 (total hours) = $2 per hour

The final answer is 2."

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Total apples = 40
Apples per pack = 8

Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
= 40 / 8
= 5

So, Uncle Franky can make 5 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000 * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000 per year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

$6,667"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the fabric will be 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet long and 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet wide.

Now, we multiply the length and width to find the area: 
10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height in inches is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To solve for 'x', we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance between San Diego and New York City (1955 kilometers).

1955 km (total distance) - 325 km (distance driven) = 1630 km

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days. 

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. 
Total people = 120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and twice that number (100) boarded the train.
Total people = 140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train.
Total people = 190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of each tile. However, since the tiles are square, we need to find the length of the side of the square tile. 

The area of each tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of tiles required: 
200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the tiles: 
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers collected this year to the total: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices: 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add these amounts together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 31."
"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, so we need to convert it to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour, so the total cost of the visit is 0.5 * $300 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The cost of parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the total cost of parking is 2 * $6 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails that don't require a response: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Since 16 emails don't require a response, the rest of the emails do. 
80 - 16 = 64 emails

Now, we divide the remaining emails by 5 to find out how many emails James responds to per day:
64 / 5 = 12.8

So, James responds to approximately 12.8 emails per day in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. 
70% of 20 = 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. 
The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
80% of 40 = 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.
Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.
Total pizzas = 20 (initial pizzas) - 46 (total pizzas eaten) = -26 pizzas.

However, since we can't have a negative number of pizzas, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, but they ate 80% of their pizzas, not 70%. 

Let's recalculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team.
The football team ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
80% of 40 = 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.
Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.
Total pizzas = 20 (initial pizzas) - 46 (total pizzas eaten) = -26 pizzas.

However, we can rephrase the problem to make it more logical. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, but they ate 80% of their pizzas, not 70%. 

Let's rephrase the problem: The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, but they ate 80% of their pizzas, not 70%.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he needs, we divide the total pounds of butter he needs (6) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00 and he gets one half off, the cost of each set is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (those who couldn't come)
Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4
Total number of guests = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

Additional guests = Total number of guests - 20
Additional guests = 41 - 20
Additional guests = 21

Cost for additional guests = Additional guests * $6
Cost for additional guests = 21 * 6
Cost for additional guests = $126

Now, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests.
Total cost = Initial fee + Cost for additional guests
Total cost = $125 + $126
Total cost = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they initially had. 

Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * 60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * 60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had: $120 - $35 = $85.

So, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles is 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen is 12, 15 roses is 1 and a half dozen. So, the cost of 15 roses is 1.5 * $15 = $22.50.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $22.50 - $5 = $17.50.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $17.50 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so $17.50 is 17.5 * 4 = 70 quarters.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a quarter, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, Jenny will leave with 70 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total sales from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total sales from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find the total waiting time. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 times the original price. 

Let's call the original price 'x'. Then, the sale price is 0.75x.

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 times the sale price. 

The sale price is 0.75x, so the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price is x, and the selling price is 0.9x. To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and divide it by the original price.

The difference is x - 0.9x = 0.1x. 

The percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100% = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store (half of 4 miles). 

The time it took him to walk to the store is the distance divided by his speed, which is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. The time it took him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost of 10 bananas is 10 * $0.80 = $8.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of 10 bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying 10 bunches from the cost of buying 10 bananas individually: $8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00. However, since we can't save a negative amount, this means that buying 10 bunches actually costs more than buying 10 bananas individually.

The correct answer is $22.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence: 100 - 20 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we need to multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years.

Annual growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. 300 * 0.15 = 45. So, 45 bikes were BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB. Since we have already accounted for 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. We can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike by its price and adding them together.

The price of an MTB is $500, so the earnings from MTB bikes is 105 * 500 = $52,500.

The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so the price of a BMX bike is $250. The earnings from BMX bikes is 45 * 250 = $11,250.

The price of a Trekking bike is $450. The earnings from Trekking bikes is 150 * 450 = $67,500.

Now, we add the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings. $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is 131,250."
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on these days. 
1/16 of his weekly minutes are spent on these days. 
There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly minutes are 7 * 60 = 420 minutes. 
1/16 of 420 minutes is 420 / 16 = 26.25 minutes. 
Since this is the total extra time for both Saturday and Sunday, we divide by 2 to get the extra time for each day. 
26.25 / 2 = 13.125 minutes per day.

Now, we add the extra minutes to the total minutes spent in classes. 
200 minutes + 13.125 minutes = 213.125 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
213.125 minutes / 60 = 3.52167 hours

The final answer is 3.52."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold. 

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last step.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's denote the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate as x. The velociraptors ate half of x, which is x/2. Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 270 * 2
x = 540

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms of meat. Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the T-Rex ate 540 kilograms. To find the initial amount, we multiply 540 by 2:

540 * 2 = 1080

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 - 1 = 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas. 

Now, there are 3 shaken sodas left. The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 3/11.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (3/11) * 100 = 27.27%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
30 minutes + (2 x 15 minutes) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes per day.

Since there are 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know Chris is 4 years old.

Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is 2 * 4 = 8 years.

Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary. 

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year. 

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, since she can't spend more than she saves, we need to recalculate the amount she saves. 

Let's assume she saves x dollars per year. Then, she spends $40,000 - x dollars per year. Since she saves 20% of her salary, we can set up the equation: 

x = 0.20 * $100,000
x = $20,000

However, this is the amount she saves, not the amount she spends. We need to find the amount she saves, which is $20,000. Since she spends $40,000, she actually saves $20,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years she needs to work to save $20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

To find the number of years, we divide the total amount she needs to save ($400,000) by the amount she saves per year ($20,000).

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the amount for retirement. Since she already has $100,000, we need to subtract the years she has already worked.

Since she saves 20% of her salary, she has already worked for 20 years. 

20 years (total years) - 20 years (years she has already worked) = 0 years.

So, Lauren needs to work 0 more years to save the amount for retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 (since it's cut into 4 equal parts) and then divide the result by 5 (since each part is further divided into 5 equal parts).

First, divide 100 cm by 4: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, divide 25 cm by 5: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we need to calculate the total number of days in June and then divide the total miles she wants to hike by the number of days.

June has 30 days. 

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. 

To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 9,300 by 30.

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we need to subtract that from the required daily miles.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

It's given that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, to find out how far Brian will walk, we need to divide the distance Sofie walks by 2.

Distance Brian walks = Distance Sofie walks / 2

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 

Since the order is for 400 toys and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys in 10 hours. 
The remaining 200 toys are needed to fulfill the order, so the fifth worker must produce 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (200) by the number of hours worked (10). 

200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

2. Since Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, Kris must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving 7 to Rob.

3. Kris got half of the stickers from Luis, and Kris had 23 stickers initially. So, the total number of stickers Luis had is 23 * 2 = 46.

4. Luis gave half of his stickers to Seth. Since Luis had 46 stickers, Seth must have received 46 / 2 = 23 stickers from Luis.

5. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Seth received 23 stickers from Luis, Seth must have had 23 * 2 = 46 stickers initially.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply 25 boxes by 8 ounces to get 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 ounces by 16 to get 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. The total weight of the boxes is also 200 ounces, which is 12.5 pounds.

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time she spends on the beach.

First, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 2 miles on the beach. Since she walks at a constant speed, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation: 2 miles / speed = 40 minutes.

To find the speed, we can rearrange the equation: speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Now, we know that Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

The time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is: time = distance / speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Now, we can add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but we don't know the exact amount in each. However, we do know that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, he is able to drink the water.

Let's assume the second mug has x ounces of water. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the total amount of water he has after pouring is at least 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug).

We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water left after pouring, so the amount of water in the second mug must be at least 1 ounce (5 - 4 = 1). 

Now, we know that the second mug has at least 1 ounce of water. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

However, we can't determine the exact temperature of the second mug, but we can say that it is at least 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows:

- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days.
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of cows and chickens.
Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 3 scoops is. 3 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 3 = 0 scoops. 

Now, we know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops. To find out how many potatoes 0 scoops is, we need to divide 3 less than 6 potatoes by 0 scoops. However, we can't divide by zero, so we need to find out how many potatoes 1 scoop is. 

We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops, so we can set up an equation: 3x = 0 scoops. 

Now, we can solve for x. 3x = 0 scoops, so x = 0 potatoes per scoop. 

Now that we know 1 scoop is 0 potatoes, we can find out how many scoops Gomer ate. We know Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 5 less than 23 scoops is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. 

Now that we know Gomer ate 18 scoops, we can multiply 18 scoops by 0 potatoes per scoop. 18 scoops * 0 potatoes per scoop = 0 potatoes.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days.

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons in a year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the ratio of men to women is 5:9. We can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

(9/14) = x/84

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially. 

Now, we need to subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus:

54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, 34 women have remained on the bus.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 * 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 * 12 = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. 

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. 
Total cost = 5x

Since Adam has $100, we can set up the equation:
5x = 100
x = 100 / 5
x = 20

So, Adam buys 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. 
60% of 20 rocks = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks
Revenue = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
Revenue = 12 * 7
Revenue = 84

Now, let's calculate the total loss.
Total loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Total loss = 5x - 84
Total loss = 5 * 20 - 84
Total loss = 100 - 84
Total loss = 16

Adam loses $16.

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The maximum number of days is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, we multiply 31 days by $1.

31 days * $1/day = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May.

$31"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the total number of roses she initially had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial roses = 30
Roses given to her mother = 24
Roses bought = 15

Total roses now = Initial roses - Roses given to her mother + Roses bought
Total roses now = 30 - 24 + 15
Total roses now = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning to find the probability that both tickets are winners:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 

27 - 5 = 22

This means Carlos collected 22 seashells. 

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide 22 by 2.

22 / 2 = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got when they divided them equally.

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60

60 / 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. 
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days.
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend.
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time.

Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand of 2300 people.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = -1740 bottles (shortfall)

However, since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total energy demand in terms of the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand. We can do this by subtracting the current production from the total demand:

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Let's assume y is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand. We can set up the equation:

y = 2300 * 0.2

y = 460

Now, we can find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand:

y - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce to meet the demand. We can do this by dividing the total energy demand by the number of bottles Hortex can produce per day:

460 / 4200 = 0.109 (approximately)

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles Hortex can produce per day by the number of people:

4200 * 0.109 = 462

Since Hortex can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number:

462 → 463

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce to meet the demand. We can do this by dividing the total energy demand by the number of bottles Hortex can produce per day:

460 / 4200 = 0.109 (approximately)

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles Hortex can produce per day by the number of people:

4200 * 0.109 = 462

Since Hortex can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number:

462 → 463

Now, we can find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand:

463 - 4200 = -3737

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of purple babies wearing a bow.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplet). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the total number of babies, which is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

Probability = (2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 75.2%

The final answer is 75.2."
"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his land for $50. Since he had 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * 3 = $60.

To find the total amount of money he received, we add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to calculate how many eggs each person found and subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than 400, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

Now, we add 240 to 400 to get the total number of apartments in the last complex: 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know the total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so he makes 3120 * 0.40 = $1248 per week.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (7 * 2450) - 200 = 10 * 17150 - 200 = 171500 - 200 = 171300 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years and the 10th year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 171300 + 1000 = 235700

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and B into the third equation: 
4B + B + Y = 37
5B + Y = 37

Now we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation: 
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: 
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to his sister, so he has 5 - 3 = $2 left.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are four colors of paint and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, let's denote the amount of each color as 'x'. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided into three colors, so the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple) and they are equal, we can set up the equation: x + x + x = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2. 

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.2).

Number of pods in the new box = 100 * 1.2 = 120 pods

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with 120 pods for $1. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, we can divide the total number of pods by 1 to find the number of cycles.

Number of cycles = 120 pods / 1 pod per cycle = 120 cycles

So, you can run 120 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

Since the teacher can only write with 20% of the chalk, we need to find out how much chalk is 20% of the original 5 inches. 

20% of 5 inches is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we need to find out how many times 1 inch fits into 2.25 inches. 

2.25 / 1 = 2.25. 

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk after 2.25 / 1 = 2.25 days. 

However, since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 3 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from John's age. 

Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up an equation. Let's say Jim's age at that time was x. 

Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at that time was 2x. 

We know that the time difference between now and when Digimon came out is the same for both John and Jim. 

So, we can set up the equation: 28 - x = 2x - x (since the time difference is the same for both)

Simplifying the equation: 28 = x

So, Jim's age when Digimon came out was 28. 

To find Jim's current age, we need to add the time difference to Jim's age at that time. Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, Jim's current age is 28 + 20 = 48.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. 

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. Since the scotch costs $600 for 10 bottles, the cost of one scotch bottle is $600 / 10 = $60. 
The cost of one cognac bottle is $60 + 50% of $60, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we can add the total number of trees planted on both days: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 80.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation based on the given information is 4x + 8 = 40.

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'x':
4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the number of fish without red stripes. 

Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can find the number of fish without red stripes by subtracting one-third of 66 from 66. 

66 - (1/3 * 66) = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we multiply 44 by 5/11.

44 * (5/11) = 20

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

42"
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells. 
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells.
700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.
420 - 252 = 168 shells.

The final answer is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, we need to divide the total number of miles by 4 to find the average. 8 miles / 4 dogs = 2 miles per dog.

So, the last dog needs 2 miles per day."

"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

Total weight of the tunas = weight of the first tuna + weight of the second tuna + weight of the last tuna
Total weight of the tunas = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg
Total weight of the tunas = 128 kg

Now, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.
Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total earnings = $64

The final answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

So, the total amount Stephen needs to pay back is the initial amount plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in those months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to pay back.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount - Amount already paid
= $306 - $275
= $31

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then find the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height: 
6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the total volume by 0.8 to find the total number of jelly beans the jar can hold:
540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the number of red jelly beans:
675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated from the true number:
900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop.

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, we need to find the number of people who entered at the second station. We are given that 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first station entered the bus at the second station.

Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30
Number of people who entered at the second station = 30

Now, we need to find the total number of people on the bus after the second stop.

Total number of people after the first stop = 60
Number of people who entered at the second stop = 30
Total number of people after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

Now, we are given that the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station. This means the number of people on the bus after the second stop is doubled.

Number of people on the bus after the second stop = 90
Number of people on the bus after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180

Now, we need to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required for each group.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time required for each group:

Each group has 8 students, and they use their full 45 minutes.

Total time for 3 groups = 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of the nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. 

Since Karen is getting both, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services. 

First, we find the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of the discounted services and the nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we have the capacity of each shelf: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

The total capacity of the middle two shelves is 10 + 10 = 20 books. Adding the capacity of the top shelf, the total capacity is 20 + 15 = 35 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide 110 by 35 to find out how many sets of shelves she needs. 
110 / 35 = 3.142857 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 4 sets of shelves to hold all of her books.

The answer is: 4"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Now, let's find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by 12:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Since Rose sells each egg for $1, we multiply the total number of eggs by the selling price per egg:

60 eggs * $1/egg = $60

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.

2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3. Now, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right in both tests.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 70) + (70% of 40)
Total questions = (0.7 * 70) + (0.7 * 40)
Total questions = 49 + 28
Total questions = 77

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Since Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total, we subtract the questions she got right in the first test from the total:

Questions needed in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions needed in the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed in the second test = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. 

We can write the equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply the result by the number of years.

Number of games played per year = 40
Number of points scored per game = 21
Number of years = 4

Total points scored = (Number of games played per year * Number of points scored per game) * Number of years
Total points scored = (40 * 21) * 4
Total points scored = 840 * 4
Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the steps:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He found one more marble that wasn't a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, it just changes the type of item he has.

So, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles and the other half have 5 medium candles. 

So, the number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16 and the number of medium candles is 5 * 4 = 20.

The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

The total number of candles and flashlights is 36 + 4 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply 2 by 55 to get the total number of chips: 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person.

The final answer is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes). 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the water needed for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time. So, the total time is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost, we need to divide the number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of sticks per box and then multiply by the cost per box.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since there are 30 days in June, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

So, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to find out how many words he can speak in 1 minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can divide 60 by his new speed to get the time it takes to speak 1 minute.

Time to speak 1 minute = 60 / 375 = 0.16 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many words he can speak in 1 minute. Since there are 450 words per page, we can multiply the number of words per page by the number of pages.

Number of words per minute = 450 * 10 = 4500 words per minute

Now, we can divide the number of words per minute by the time it takes to speak 1 minute to get the number of minutes it takes to speak 4500 words.

Time to speak 4500 words = 4500 / 4500 = 1 minute

So, it would take John 1 minute to speak 4500 words, which is equivalent to 10 pages."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people for the first three days.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
Total number of people for the week = 260 + 300 = 560

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 560."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice for 5 gallons. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice by multiplying 5 cups by 6 lemons per cup. 

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, Tim will need 1/2 cup of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1/2 cup of juice by multiplying 1/2 cup by 6 lemons per cup. 

(1/2) * 6 lemons = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon. 

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We can subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total to find the number of red blocks.

32 (total blocks) - 4 (blue blocks) - 8 (yellow blocks) = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 7.33 packs

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, John will need to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

8 packs * $2 per pack = $16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money Frances has left:
$80 (total income) - $20 (total expenses) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, so the total becomes 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, so the total becomes 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, so the total becomes 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

60 - 5 = 55

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 + 24 = 36
- 3 sisters: 3 * 16 = 48

Total age = 36 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. So, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 30 * 28 (days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes for meditation, and 1200 minutes for yoga. 

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds to it for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. 

Now, we add 50% more seeds to the small sunflower's seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

So, the large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds of the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

90"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's pens.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $14.25 ÷ $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases:

- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: 335"
"To find the total cost of making one jar, we need to add the cost of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. 

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total revenue from selling 10 jars. 
Total revenue: 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440
Profit = $60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values of all the coins together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is 144."
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the number of cookies he ate and gave away.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (unchanged)

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (unchanged)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

He baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

So, Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23."
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount he would get from selling each half of his collection.

He has 12 unique toy soldiers, so he can divide them into two equal halves. 

Half of 12 is 6. So, he would sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

The total amount he would get from selling the 6 toy soldiers for $5 each is 6 * $5 = $30.

The total amount he would get from selling the 6 toy soldiers for $7 each is 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount he would earn, we need to add the amounts from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is 72."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes Nate's dog dug during his vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, he fills in 9 holes per day. However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."

= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes, we can find the number of beakers by subtracting the total number of test tubes and Petri dishes from the total number of items on the lab bench.

So, the number of beakers is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, we know that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Therefore, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance, which is 2 miles. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, her speed is 2 * 1/8 = 1/4 miles per minute.

To find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can divide the distance by her speed: 4 miles / (1/4 miles per minute) = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate how much line is required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, to find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount required: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- They get 6 reservations a night.
- Each meal costs $5, so 6 meals cost 6 * $5 = $30.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per night, so the total daily revenue is $30 + $5 = $35.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is $35 * 2 = $70.

The final answer is 70."
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80.

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Now, substitute 'c' in the second equation: 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding the equation: 40 - 2b + 4b = 70.

Combine like terms: 2b = 30.

Divide by 2: b = 15.

Now that we know 'b' is 15, we can find 'c' by substituting 'b' back into the equation c = 20 - b: c = 20 - 15 = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends).

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
