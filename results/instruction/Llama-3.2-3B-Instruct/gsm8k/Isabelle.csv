"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

Total eggs eaten and baked = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs

Remaining eggs = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

Daily earnings = 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs per week.

James runs 60 meters in each sprint. He runs 3 sprints per week. 

Total meters per week = 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The final answer is: 180"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed given so far is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups per chicken.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed given so far is 2 * 20 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them 40 cups of feed, she needs to give them 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed in total.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 12 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (loss in the first year)

However, we are interested in when the tree starts generating a positive net profit. 

Let's calculate the number of years it takes to break even:

Year 1: Loss of $82.5
Year 2: Net profit of $7.5
Year 3: Net profit of $7.5 + $7.5 = $15
Year 4: Net profit of $15 + $7.5 = $22.5

It will take 3 years for the tree to start generating a positive net profit.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners.

Now, we know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

(1/3)x = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can simply add the distances covered by both trains, which is 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we add the distances covered by both trains, which is 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts to get the total distance covered by each train. 

Total distance covered by each train = 160 miles (westward) + 300 miles (northward) = 460 miles.

The final answer is: 460"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from teaching would be: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $20/hour = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from coaching would be: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $30/hour = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 336 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 336 / 12 = 28.

So, Claire will eat 28 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent walking so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent walking so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the total distance is 12 miles, and we want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Let's denote the time she needs to spend walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be 2 hours (time spent so far) + t.

We can set up the equation: 12 / (2 + t) = 4

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t) to get: 12 = 4(2 + t)

Expanding the equation, we get: 12 = 8 + 4t

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 4 = 4t

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: t = 1

Since 't' represents the time spent walking the remaining distance, we can find the speed by dividing the remaining distance by 't'. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time = 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the 24 liters of the pineapple drink. Since the total amount is 24 liters, we can convert 26/3 to a decimal: 26/3 = 8.67 liters. 

Now, we add 8.67 liters to 24 liters: 8.67 + 24 = 32.67 liters.

The final answer is: 32.67"
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond was 25 when his son was born. To find the number of years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

31 (Samantha's current age) - 25 (Raymond's age at son's birth) = 6 years

Raymond's son was born 6 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 25 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, this means he must have had $35 - $5 = $30 before buying the video games.

Now, we know that he had $30 and he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide $30 by $15, which is 30 / 15 = 2.

However, this is not the correct answer because he had 13 Lego sets initially. The correct answer is that he still has 13 - 8 = 5 Lego sets left."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 60 miles

- Day 3: 30 miles
Total distance run per week: 60 + 30 + 30 = 120 miles

Time spent running per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total time spent running per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's average running speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 20 miles per hour

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance traveled while walking is 3 miles per hour * 4 hours = 12 miles.

The total distance traveled is 12 miles (running) + 12 miles (walking) = 24 miles.

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find the number of servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams.

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is:
20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles * 1 pound/candle = 20 pounds of beeswax
The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is:
20 pounds * $10.00/pound = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The net profit is -$160.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as 'x'. 

We know that the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones in her purse and the ones in the package. So, the total number of Post-it notes is 80 + x.

We also know that after using 220 Post-it notes at work, she had 23 remaining. This can be represented as (80 + x) - 220 = 23.

Now, let's solve for 'x':

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the package she purchased contained 163 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we can find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 * $60 (truck tires) + 4 * $40 (car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 * $40 (car tires) = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The cost of a movie outing is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we can divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies:

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

The total number of oranges that are not good is the sum of unripe and sour oranges, which is 5 + 2 = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000.

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.
10% of $140 is 0.1 * 140 = $14
So, the amount charged for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126
Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons of gas. To do this, we can divide the remaining gas by the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car.

However, we don't know the miles per gallon of her car. We can find this out by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the remaining gas in the tank (8 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank.

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can write the equation as 0.5 * 400 = 200. 

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x: x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the invited guests since 1/4 don't show up. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests attending by the number of gift bags per guest:

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag:

9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed would be G - 2. 

We know that Lee's speed is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: G - 2 = 38. Solving for G, we get G = 40.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed was 40 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new speed by multiplying his original speed by 1.1 (which is equivalent to a 10% increase). 

Gerald's new speed = 40 * 1.1 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made came from 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used, then multiply that by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans
4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the ones that took the exit. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took the exit
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will remain with, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses from weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and then determine the total amount of water taken on.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on per foot as 2/10 = 0.2 liters per foot.

Now, we know Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the rate at which she rows, we can divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate the total distance Julia rowed: 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Now, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water taken on per foot: 80 feet * 0.2 liters/foot = 16 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up an equation to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B. We can set up the equation:

6B = 1800

To find B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now that we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we are told that this is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in the photograph as D. We can set up the equation:

300 = 50D

To find D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that Jennie put 20 stamps on the letters. Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can calculate the initial number of letters in that pile as follows:

Initial number of letters in the pile = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters Jennie put stamps on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply by 12.

Number of car washes per month: 4
Cost of each car wash: $15
Total cost per month: 4 * $15 = $60
Total cost per year: $60 * 12 = $720

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add the delivery fee and tip.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the number of questions by the time taken: 75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed.

Since Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour, we can calculate the time taken to complete the first test as 600 questions / 5 questions per hour = 120 hours. However, we know Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, so he completed all the questions in the first test.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

To find the number of questions left incomplete in the second test, we subtract the number of questions completed from the total number of questions: 100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions left incomplete.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to the result. 

48 + 22 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the total hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide that by the frequency of harvesting.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests per year

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests per year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 45 bees had returned before this point, so 60 - 45 = 15 bees from the second wave of bees leave without returning.

The remaining bees from the second wave that leave in the next 6 hours are 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours, we need to add the 30 bees that initially left to the 15 bees that left in the second wave but didn't return. 

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 (initially left) + 15 (second wave didn't return) = 45 bees.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has.

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert Tim's distance to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute = 60 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 60 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home:

Waiting time = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since you can't have a negative number of fries, this means the pigeons ate all the fries, and there are no fries left.
6. However, the problem states that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants took the last fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
7. Since the pigeons ate all the fries after the seagull, and before the ants took the last fry, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries, which is a total of 7 + 9 = 16 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so the total hours for the semester is (9 + 8) * 16 = 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round, and she does this 34 times. 
180 yards * 34 = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance. 
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is: 
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth on Tuesday first. 

The depth on Monday was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. So, the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth on Wednesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3. 

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Cost after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Cost after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Cost after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Cost after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Cost after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Cost after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Cost after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of all the toys is the sum of the costs of the red cars, the doll, and the action figures. So, the total cost is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. If she loses 3 hours of freelance work, that's 3 hours * $35/hour = $105 in lost income.

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2 to it. 

Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the total miles he walks on the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to add the minimum payments for all debts and then multiply by 1.5 (since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum).

Minimum monthly payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

To pay 50% more, we multiply the total by 1.5: $1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation to find the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. The equation would be:

$10 (revenue per gallon) * number of gallons = $25 (profit) + C

However, we don't know the number of gallons yet. We know that for each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons as G. Then, the total cost is $5 * G. We can now rewrite the equation:

$10 * G = $25 + $5 * G

Subtracting $5 * G from both sides gives us:

$5 * G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5 gives us:

G = $25 / $5
G = 5 gallons

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost:

Total cost = $5 * G
Total cost = $5 * 5
Total cost = $25

Since the total cost includes both the cost of lemons and sugar, we need to subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons. The cost of sugar is $2 * 5 = $10. 

Cost of lemons = Total cost - Cost of sugar
Cost of lemons = $25 - $10
Cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to first determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

Since there are 80 Japanese participants, and the total number of participants is 240, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Number of Chinese participants = Total participants - Number of Japanese participants
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these amounts from Zaid's total salary: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Now, since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of 28 is 14, and Mark was 5 years older than that, so two years ago, Mark was 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to 19, which gives us M = 21.

We already know that J = M + 2, so we can substitute M = 21 into this equation to find Jean's current age: J = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since there are four members in the team.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time taken by the less well-rounded team. 

The first runner takes 60 seconds. 
The second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0 * 100) = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used for the rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the total straw used among the small rodents. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.

We also know that there are 20 pieces of straw used for the rabbits.

Now, let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of straw used for rats is 3x.

We are given that the total straw used among the small rodents is 160 pieces. So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 50 + 20 = 160.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 70 = 160.

Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get: 3x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 rats in each cage.

"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we divide the total transportation cost by the cost per bag to find the number of bags:
Number of bags = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags = $140 / $2
Number of bags = 70

However, this is the total number of bags transported, not the number of bags sold. Since the cost per bag is $20, and the selling price is $30, the profit per bag is $10. 

Number of bags sold = Total revenue / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $400 / $10
Number of bags sold = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute, and he collects for 3 hours. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute (2) by the total number of minutes (180):

2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed: 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week: 7

Daily amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds / 7 days
Daily amount of insects needed = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total number of trees planted is 10 * 10 = 100. The total number of trees chopped down is 2 * 10 = 20.

The total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 100 - 20 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is 91."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has, which is $20. So, $20 - $10 = $10.

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots to be distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them together.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

The final answer is: $104,500."
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre and then by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and then add the pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she initially had is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, each containing 9 pens, so she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, each containing 6 pens, so she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the pens she initially had to the pens she bought: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the last three weeks to find the total kilometers he rode in total. 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 460."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The total cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates, we can set up an equation:

Total cost of 6 plates - $1200 = Total cost of 240 cups

Total cost of 6 plates = $6000 + $1200
Total cost of 6 plates = $7200

Now, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of 240 cups by 240:

Cost of one cup = Total cost of 240 cups / 240
Cost of one cup = $7200 / 240
Cost of one cup = $30

The total cost of buying each cup is $30."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn more from babysitting than from lawn mowing, we can conclude that she needs to babysit 12 times and mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). 

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

Third day customers = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

The final answer is 183."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express x as x = 4y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 16 = 0

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4y = -16

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -4

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can set up a new equation based on the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 + 11 = 15.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three in three years:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for 3 hours at $30 an hour, so his total cost is 3 * $30 = $90.

Benji rented a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 an hour, so his total cost is 5 * $18 = $90.

Now, we add their costs together: $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180.

The total cost for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The time taken to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.
The time taken to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is half of the time taken by bus, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg: 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100: (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 48%.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add the base cost of the burrito to the additional items and the upgrade.

Base cost of the burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of additional items: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $10.00

Upgrade cost: $3.00
Total cost of the meal: $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total cost:
$13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

Chad still owes $8.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

To find the number of melons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the total remaining melons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for 12 cars is 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's tomato consumption.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices needed by 8: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

In addition to the 25 new pens, Ram already has the 25 pens he bought initially. So, the total number of pens he has is:

25 (initial pens) + 25 (new pens) = 50 pens

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to first find the ages of Mary and Joan.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Robert = 54
Robert = 54 / 2
Robert = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James = Robert + 6
James = 27 + 6
James = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
Difference = John - James

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 penpals left.

Each of his penpals sends 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing one letter is 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.

Since he writes 6 letters per week, the total time he spends writing per week is 6 * 30 = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), so 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies, and her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 * 20 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We can calculate the number of boys in the third class as follows:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - (Number of boys in the first class + Number of boys in the second class)
We don't know the number of boys in the first and second classes, but we can find it by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in the first class = Total number of students in the first class - Number of girls in the first class
= 20 - 15
= 5 boys

Number of boys in the second class = Total number of students in the second class - Number of girls in the second class

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

4 times 21 is 4 * 21 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Finally, let's subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $18,000.

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $18,000."
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall total:
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2 to find the number of golf balls.

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows.

Next, we add the additional windows in each house: 4 windows per house. So, 12 windows from the bedrooms + 4 windows per house = 16 windows.

Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows by 2 to get the total number of windows between the houses: 16 windows * 2 houses = 32 windows.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to add up the total number of stories they wrote in both weeks. 
Alani wrote 20 + 40 = 60 stories in total.
Braylen wrote 40 + 80 = 120 stories in total.
Margot wrote 60 + 120 = 180 stories in total.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The remaining stars are 5-star rows. Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 + 5x. 

Since the total number of stars on a flag is 76, we can set up the equation: 
24 + 12 + 5x = 76 
36 + 5x = 76 
5x = 40 
x = 8 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children. 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8. 16 / 8 = 2.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she worked. 

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she paused for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she earns: 150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount Carmen paid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total increase in the price due to their bids is 3 * $50 = $150.

Carmen initially bid $200. After the 3 other people bid, the price increased by $150. So, the price after the 3 other bids is $200 + $150 = $350.

Carmen then bids after each of the 3 other people, which means she bids 4 times. The price increases by $50 each time she bids. So, the total increase in price due to her bids is 4 * $50 = $200.

The final price of the desk is the sum of the price after the 3 other bids and the total increase due to Carmen's bids. Therefore, the final price is $350 + $200 = $550.

The desk costs Carmen $550."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper.

Since the paper is folded vertically, we have two sides: left and right. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

When folding the paper, each side is unfolded to create two separate pieces of paper. Therefore, we need 2 pieces of paper for each side, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 pieces of paper.

However, we also need to consider the front and back of each piece of paper. Since the paper is folded, the front and back of each piece are swapped. 

So, for the left side, we have 2 pieces of paper with 2 pages each (pages 1-2 and pages 15-16), and for the right side, we have 2 pieces of paper with 2 pages each (pages 17-18 and pages 31-32).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 2 (left side) + 2 (right side) = 4 pieces of paper.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

Total extra arms: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Total extra legs: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, after 15 days, the person will have 3 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts for his business partners.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who could attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since we know the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation 3x = 45. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 15. 

So, the number of electric poles required is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men and add the number of people who left.

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women who stayed = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed: 120 / 24 = 5.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (assuming she uses 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

However, the coffee becomes 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube. Since Shannon adds 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

The total number of new records received is 7, and since 2 old records are required to get 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

However, this is the total number of old records traded, not the number of old records brought in by the 5 people. Since each person brings in x old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5x.

We know that the total number of old records traded is equal to the total number of old records brought in, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't trade a fraction of a record. However, in this case, the answer is not a whole number, which indicates that the initial assumption of 5 people bringing in x old records each might not be accurate.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, and 2 old records are required to get 1 new record, we can assume that the 5 people brought in a total of 7 * 2 = 14 old records. 

So, the correct answer is 14."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $184000."
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. 
To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to add the number of people who got off at the second stop to the number of people heading to the third stop: 20 + 7 = 27.

Now, we can find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal by subtracting the total number of people on the bus from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 27 - 13 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the total time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The job with the higher net pay rate is Job B, with a net pay of $32,400. To find the difference, subtract the net pay of Job A from Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Now that we know the number of chickens (40) and cows (20), we can calculate the total number of legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens is 40 * 2 = 80.

Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs from all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

The total number of pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 pots.

Since April already had 100 pots, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the cost per person includes the cost of one round of mini-golf ($5) and 2 go-kart rides ($20). 

Cost per person = $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (2 go-kart rides) = $25

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find the number of friends Morgan can invite:
$60 / $25 = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, the amount she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the total amount of money Billy had initially was $10, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = S
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services every 20 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken for the detour = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to come back home
Total time = 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours

The final answer is: 8.86"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2 since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2

Now, to find the total number of kids, we add the number of boys and girls together.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5) and the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10).

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(10) = 30.

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifters, and those kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14.

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan is making his own, he will save 20% on the materials cost. 

Let's assume the cost of the materials is x. Then, 20% of x is 0.2x. 

The total cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is the sum of the cost of the materials and the cost of the original wallpaper. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 400 = 0.8x (since 100% - 20% = 80%)

Now, let's solve for x:

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, so it was 1 * 2 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add the hours together: 
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = (number of functioning pieces) * price per piece

We know that the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

However, we don't know the price per piece. We can express the total amount spent as:

400,000 = 0.6x * price per piece

To find the price per piece, we need more information. However, we can express the total amount spent as a percentage of the total number of pieces:

400,000 = 0.6x * price per piece
400,000 = 0.6x * (400,000 / x)
400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000
400,000 = 240,000

This equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that the total amount spent is equal to 60% of the total amount spent. This is not possible.

However, we can assume that the price per piece is constant, and the total amount spent is directly proportional to the number of functioning pieces. In this case, we can express the total amount spent as:

400,000 = 0.6 * (number of functioning pieces) * price per piece

Since we don't know the price per piece, we can express the total amount spent as a percentage of the total number of pieces:

400,000 = 0.6 * (number of functioning pieces) * (400,000 / 400,000)
400,000 = 0.6 * (number of functioning pieces)

Now, we can solve for the number of functioning pieces:

number of functioning pieces = 400,000 / 0.6
number of functioning pieces = 666,667

Now that we know the number of functioning pieces, we can calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = number of functioning pieces * price per piece
Since we don't know the price per piece, we can express the total amount spent as a percentage of the total number of pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6 * 400,000
Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine how many socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies initially: 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away: 65 + 44 = 109

Now, let's subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 109 = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for calculating monthly interest is: 
Monthly interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 12

Given values: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Monthly interest = (3650 * 0.10 * 5) / 12
Monthly interest = 146.88

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we add the monthly interest to the principal amount to get the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Principal + Monthly interest
Monthly payment = 3650 + 146.88
Monthly payment = 3796.88

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3796.88."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Total silver = 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150
Total gold = 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * 5/2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them. 
The discount on each service is 20% of $10, which is $2. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 - $2 - $2 = $16 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services: 
$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Since Tim was paying $60 per month for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Next, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we convert the total energy used to kilowatts:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

The new total energy used in 30 days:
2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

Now, we calculate the energy saved:
216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of ingredients needed as follows:

Total people / people per sandwich = total sandwiches needed
20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost = cost of meat + cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns Allan initially had. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
= 2 * 40
= 80

Next, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

New total number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + 60
= 40 + 60
= 100

We also know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

New total number of corns = New total number of cannolis - 40
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Combined total = New total number of corns + New total number of cannolis

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before the jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how long it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive at the airport 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of these items is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog):
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Then, we find 1% of the defective candles (will explode):
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister does. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, Joanne must gather all the apples from the average trees. Therefore, 440 - 3x = x.

Solving for x, we get 440 = 4x, so x = 110.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees: 440 - 3x = 440 - 3(110) = 440 - 330 = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute C into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet) and the elevation where the comb landed (6,000 feet). 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add up the costs for all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: $424"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 6) = (1/3)x - 2. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6) = (2/3)x + 4.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from both jeans, which is equal to $6. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine like terms:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x = 8

However, this would mean the jogger jeans cost the same as the tattered jeans, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

Simplify the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2x = 24

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The 6 minibusses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The 10 minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we still need to find the value of x.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10, and the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x.

We also know that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same. Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

We can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 3x

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 6x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders:

3(x + 10) = 3(10 + 10) = 3(20) = 60

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders:

60 + 3x = 60 + 3(10) = 60 + 30 = 90

So, Lillian can expect to see 90 birds in her garden each day.

90"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he's going to the amusement park, that means he has $50 from the sale of his cards. 

We know that he sells his cards for $1.5 each and he has $50 from the sale. To find out how many cards he sold, we can divide $50 by $1.5.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Now, we know that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. This means he sold 2/3 of his cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, 2/3 of x is 33. 

(2/3)x = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total guests = 36
Hotdogs per guest for half of the guests = 2
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total hotdogs needed - Total hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

44"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 

6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount:

Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

Now, we know that 1% of 500 is 5 cents, and he had 5 cents left. This means he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars (495 cents) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents) to find the number of candy bars he bought:

495 / 75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

7"
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 1*20 + 2*20 = 1 + 40 = 41 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 3*20 + 4*20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 41 = 99.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking:
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours = 3
Total temperature increase = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees per 10 minutes
Time the window is open = 30 minutes
Number of 10-minute intervals = 30 / 10 = 3
Total cooling effect = 2 * 3 = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase:
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Cooling effect
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the total cost of the hay as follows: 
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail 
Total cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * 3 
Total cost of hay = 24 dollars 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has: 
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay 
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars 
Change = 6 dollars

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. So, the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $20 - $3 = $17.

We are also given that buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price saves $2. This means that the cost of the popcorn and the soda together is $12 + $2 = $14.

Since we know the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $17, and the total cost of the popcorn and soda together is $14, we can set up the equation:

17 = P + S

We also know that the soda costs $3, so we can substitute S = $3 into the equation:

17 = P + 3

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 17 - 3
P = 14

So, the regular price of popcorn is $14.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. 

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards)

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 3700 / 2250 = 1.65.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1.

So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

First, let's calculate the total number of shoes he gets:
5 pairs on Monday + 15 pairs on Wednesday + 30 pairs on Friday = 50 pairs

Now, let's add the shoes he already had to the shoes he got:
200 (initial shoes) + 50 (new shoes) = 250 shoes

Finally, let's subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday:
250 - 180 = 70

Fireman Frank will have 70 shoes on Sunday."
"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. 

Since Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans she needs: 48 / 12 = 4.

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

48"
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen, then subtract $1. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The cost of the piece of paper is $6 - $1 = $5. 

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7. 

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3."
"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * 240 = 80

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the remoras to feet by dividing by 12: 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents: (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10%"
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20
total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk (7 days in a week). 

240 minutes / 7 days = 34.29 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.29 minutes each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks.

34.29"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to each substance to avoid double counting.

Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to get the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the amount Keegan and Tashay have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate 3 times the number of songs Gabriel has. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, so 3 times that is 20 * 3 = 60 songs. 

Since Luri already has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, he has 60 songs. 

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we need to subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity of his player. 

The maximum capacity of Luri's player is 100 songs, and he already has 60 songs. 

100 - 60 = 40

Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

Daily consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds
Daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
Total oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 
Number of bags needed = Total oats needed / oats per bag = 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will pay for only 1 pack. 

The total cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine the number of guests required for both venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, which equals $200 + 5x. 

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which equals 25x.

To find the point where both venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are required for both venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the expression for D from the second equation into the first equation: L = (B/2) + 7.

Substituting this expression for L into the third equation, we get: (B/2) + 7 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: (3/2)B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: (3/2)B = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2/3: B = 24.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Finally, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.015 per stick

Since 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 lumber to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make.

Number of 2 x 8 lumber pieces he can buy = $24 / $6
Number of 2 x 8 lumber pieces = 4

Total sticks from 2 x 8 lumber = 4 * 400 sticks

"To calculate the weekly cost of bus trips without a pass, we need to multiply the cost of a single trip by the number of trips per week. 

Cost per trip = $2.20
Trips per week = 5
Weekly cost without pass = Cost per trip * Trips per week
Weekly cost without pass = $2.20 * 5
Weekly cost without pass = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost with the pass:
Weekly cost with pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the weekly cost with the pass from the weekly cost without the pass:
Savings = Weekly cost without pass - Weekly cost with pass
Savings = $11.00 - $20
Savings = -$9.00

Since we can't have a negative savings, it means that buying a weekly bus pass would actually cost Janet $9 more than not buying one."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

There are 30 days in a month, so 8 months is 8 * 30 = 240 days. Adding the 20 days, he has a total of 240 + 20 = 260 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 260 days ≈ 404 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 404 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday.

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot, which is x + 3x = 4x. 

Given that the total cost is $120,000, we can set up the equation 4x = 120,000. Solving for x, we get x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000. 

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is 90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Then, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $64 - $32
Profit = $32

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has initially, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total amount of money Ali has initially is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80.
The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how long it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Martha will need 255 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, Chris completed 13 problems on Wednesday.

The total number of problems completed so far is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29."

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Now, we need to find the rate at which 5 people paint the house. Since the rate is additive, we can multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3 * 22 = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

Number of CDs = Total amount spent on headphones / Cost of one CD

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is 84."

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The time difference between a hot day and a cold day is 54 minutes.

Now, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to calculate the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward at 5 degrees per hour, the change in angle over 10 hours is 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

The new angle of the sun relative to the ground will be the initial angle plus the change in angle, which is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5. 

12 (older son's candles) + 8 (younger son's candles) = 20 candles. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12 on candles.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week: 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) to the pages read in the second week (100): 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the original amount: 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

10"
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments for each set of teeth.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is (3 * $1.00) / 2 = $1.50 per tooth. Since there are two teeth, that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $5.00 + $3.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

The final answer is: $11.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, we have the number of goals scored by each teenager: Richie (80), Mark (60), and Anna (35).

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter had $70. After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he had $70 - $20 = $50 left. Then, he spent $6 on plastic action figures, leaving him with $50 - $6 = $44.

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with $44 is $44 / $2 = 22.

In total, Peter will have 4 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

Total action figures = 4 + 22 = 26"
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply in a month and then subtract the total number of roses he grows in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

Ford grows 40 roses per week. 
Total roses in a month = 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Total roses ordered in a month = 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses ordered in a month.
Roses lacking = Total roses ordered in a month - Total roses grown in a month
Roses lacking = 260 - 160
Roses lacking = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

Total amount removed = $100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves used + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the number of loaves used is equal to the number of sandwiches sold, which is 10.
Total cost = $3.00 per loaf * 10 loaves + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first determine how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

Now, we can multiply the number of muffins by the selling price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature for the recipe. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
520 * 1.04 = 540

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540 degrees. 

540"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies to minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she must have brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of days one pair of contacts lasts:
45 days / 2 = 22.5 days

Now, we can find the cost of each pair of contacts:
$180.00 / 22.5 days = $8.00 per day

Since there are 90 contacts in a box, we can find the number of pairs in one box:
90 contacts / 2 = 45 pairs

The cost of each pair of contacts is:
$8.00 per day * 45 pairs = $360.00 per box

However, we need to consider the discount. The original price of 2 boxes is $180.00, and the discount is 10% of the original price of 2 boxes:
$180.00 * 0.10 = $18.00

The discounted price of 2 boxes is:
$180.00 - $18.00 = $162.00

Now, we can find the cost of each pair of contacts:
$162.00 / 45 pairs = $3.60 per pair

The final answer is: $3.60"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.
John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.
Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. 

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water. 

1600 / 200 = 8

So, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends, so the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 invited people, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 100 + 200 + 20 = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

The difference in cost between the two platforms is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

George has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

First, let's convert the coins into cents: 
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add the values together: 
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Total games after 3 years: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many times the tires will rotate in a year, we need to first find out how many times they rotate in a month. 

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can calculate the number of rotations per month as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, we need to find out how many rotations the tires can undergo before they need to be replaced. Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

To find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach this limit, we can divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per month:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72.55 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can convert the number of months to years:

72.55 months / 12 months per year = 6.046 years

So, the tires will need to be replaced in approximately 6.046 years.

The final answer is: 6.046"
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is 1200."
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost: $52.50 * 0.30 = $15.75.

Now, we subtract the total cost and sales tax from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $52.50 - $15.75 = -$17.25. Since we can't have a negative amount, this means Joe won't have enough money to buy the outfit.

However, if we consider the calculation without the sales tax, the total cost would be $52.50. In this case, Joe would have $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50, which is still not possible.

Since the question asks for the amount of money Joe will have left, we should consider the scenario where the sales tax is included. In this case, Joe won't have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-17.25"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days, we multiply the number of croissants per day by the number of days.

4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of croissants to pounds of butter needed.

28 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound per dozen = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250
- Month 10: $757,812.50

Now, we add up the funding for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,812.50 = $2,380,562.50

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,562.50 = $2,880,562.50

The final answer is: $2,880,562.50"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. So, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats after removing the seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 16 - 20 = -4. However, since we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights, we need to reconsider the calculation.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 20 street lights are not working, it means that 20 lights are not functioning. Since each intersection has 4 lights, we can assume that the non-functioning lights are spread across all intersections. 

To find the number of intersections with non-functioning lights, we divide the total number of non-functioning lights by the number of lights per intersection. 

20 / 4 = 5 intersections have non-functioning lights.

Now, we know that 5 intersections have non-functioning lights, and the rest have functioning lights. Since there are 4 intersections in total, the number of intersections with functioning lights is 4 - 5 = -1. However, we cannot have a negative number of intersections.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that 20 lights are not functioning, and each intersection has 4 lights. We can assume that the non-functioning lights are spread across all intersections. 

Since 20 lights are not functioning, we can assume that 5 intersections have 4 lights each, and 1 intersection has 0 lights (since 20 / 4 = 5). 

Now, we know that 5 intersections have functioning lights, and 1 intersection has 0 functioning lights. Since there are 4 intersections in total, the number of intersections with functioning lights is 5 - 1 = 4.

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces he chews: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 7 pieces.

Since Jim has 20 pieces initially, he has 20 - 7 = 13 pieces left.

Finally, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 13 / 2 = 6.5 pieces. However, since you can't give away a fraction of a piece of gum, we'll round down to 6 pieces.

So, Jim has 13 - 6 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, to find her speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds). 

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. 

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert 0.67 feet to inches: 0.67 feet * 12 inches per foot = 8 inches.

Now, let's divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we subtract $400 from the price of gold.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

We also know that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as $60 / $10 = 6 classes.

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is 20 * 28 = 560.

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is 10 * 28 = 280.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840.

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find Steve's son's wife's age, we need to break down the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. 

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his classmates.

Howie wants 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

First, we calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 classmates * 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we add the cupcakes for Howie, his teacher, and his classmates: 2 (Howie) + 2 (teacher) + 50 (classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms: 
20000 + 2000 = 70x - x 
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69: 
x = 22000 / 69 
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now that we know the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes. 
Total likes = initial likes + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 319 + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 21919"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost for her was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for her was 20 * $30 * (1 - 0.10) = 20 * $30 * 0.90 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, let's calculate the total sales for two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, so the annual rent is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The annual fuel cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the initial cost, the annual rent, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive coffee will cost 7 * $6 = $42. 

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44."
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken and the bottle of soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = 4 classes per week * 2 hours per class = 8 hours per week
Total class time for 6 weeks = 8 hours per week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, we divide the total class time by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns:
48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by the percentage of math teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we have the total amount of money each person has:
Aurelia's money = $120
Kassidy's money = $90
Rayna's money = $150

To find out how much they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

Since they want to share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each person would have $120."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs became 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 9 toys. However, he already had 4 toys, so he needs 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 8 (initially bought) + 5 (additional needed) = 13 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then add up the number of cookies each person has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the Cookie Monster's total: 61 + 23 = 84 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 84 (Summer) = 286 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 286."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20 
1.5x = 120 
x = 120 / 1.5 
x = 80 

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since there are 12 months in a year, Rong has been saving for 10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so the total number of coins he has saved is 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 coins/month + (2/5 * 20 coins/month) = 20 coins/month + 8 coins/month = 28 coins/month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. So, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total cost, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs $1. 
The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Now, we add the costs together: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of regular chairs and high chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
= 40 + 8
= 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add 57 chairs (42 + 15) to the total number of chairs. However, Mia already has 48 chairs. Therefore, she needs to get:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of chairs needed - Number of chairs already available
= 57 - 48

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great grand-babies. 

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children, so the number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck for retirement: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount for retirement and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). Each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying 3/5 of $100. 

Gerald's share = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% of 40% is greater than 40%. 

Let's recalculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of the city's water is used for industrial purposes, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, and 20% of that water is used for non-industrial purposes, we can multiply 40% by 20% to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 20 = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12, which is 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12, which is 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (the two remaining friends) = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we can find the total number of spools by adding the number of spools of each color.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. This is 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 2/3 of 3000 people is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces). 

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know that her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. 

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B received 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of apples they have after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Boris initially has 100 apples. 
Beck initially has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

The difference in the number of apples Beck has than Boris now is 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The water left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Steven's books = 20
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books: 
20 - 16 = 4

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together. 

The cost for the adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52. 
The cost for the children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24. 
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we do the same. 
The cost for the adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28. 
The cost for the children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20. 
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park. 
$76 - $48 = $28.

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old and new vendors.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference in cost per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 per day * 7 days per week = $350 per week.

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's marbles. 
Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to know the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the monthly total by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the initial trade and 60 small buttons from the second trade, for a total of 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons.

She also has 20 large buttons.

So, Lorraine has 87 small buttons and 20 large buttons by the end.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 or horse #7 will win, there are 50 - 34 = 16 people who think horse #12 will win.

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we now know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows:

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

However, she also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $65 + $30 = $95.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 57 cars with 4 wheels each, so the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 73 motorcycles with 2 wheels each, so the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to be paid.

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we can calculate the cost of the movies in series. Since they cost $6 each, the total cost is:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * $6
= $1200

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

The cost of the remaining movies (which are not in series and not older movies) is $10 each. Since there are 400 - 160 = 240 such movies, the total cost is:

Cost of remaining movies = Number of remaining movies * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the costs of all the movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the time they spent driving. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

We know they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so we can find the distance by multiplying the hiking speed by the time spent hiking: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

However, the question asks for the distance to their vacation spot, which is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10x + 15 and Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 12.

Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower, her time is x + 4 and Ava's time is x.

The time is not directly related to the score, but we can use it to find the difference in scores. We know that the time is inversely proportional to the score. 

Let's assume the time taken by Emma is 60 seconds (this is an arbitrary assumption, but it will not affect the final answer). Then, we can set up the equation:

10x + 15 = 30(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 = 30x + 120

Subtracting 10x from both sides:

15 = 20x + 120

Subtracting 120 from both sides:

-105 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

-5.25 = x

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
2 pizzas * 30 dollars/pizza = 60 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 dollars / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish after buying more is 3 + x.

The total number of fish after buying more is 7 (initial fish) + x (new white fish) + 17 (new fish from the pet store). Since the total number of fish is the sum of white and orange fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x + 17 = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

20 + x = 8 + 2x

Subtracting x from both sides:

20 = 8 + x

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

12 = x

So, Bob bought 12 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, we add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each group had 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and the number of seashells each member brought back:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people on the train and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people on the train: 172
Number of people who got off at the first stop: 47
Number of people who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people who got off at the second stop: 38

First, subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop: 172 - 47 = 125
Then, add the number of people who got on at the first stop: 125 + 13 = 138
Finally, subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

There are 100 people on the train."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

Total bottle caps collected in a month: 10 * 30 = 300

"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. So, her special pay for 3 hours is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 6 (male) + 12 (female) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid to employees after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.
Then, we add the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total caroling time will be 540 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, to find the total score, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students = 1000 students
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. 
30 - 21 = 9 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car is faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and the gold separately, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

He sold 150 candies, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

To sell all of his candies, he needs to sell 200 - 50 = 150 more.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

The total number of petals in the vase is 101."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used: 
John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows: 
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used) - 3 (dropped) = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 
14 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 7 S'mores.

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so he played 240 / 20 = 12 games.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they played 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. They played 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they played 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. They played 240 / 30 = 8 games.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Jack played 12 games at 20 minutes per game, so he spent 12 * 20 = 240 minutes. Since each game costs 1 quarter, he spent 240 / 4 = 60 quarters, which is equivalent to 60 * $0.25 = $15.

- The friend who is significantly worse played 24 games at 10 minutes per game, so they spent 24 * 10 = 240 minutes. They spent 240 / 4 = 60 quarters, which is equivalent to 60 * $0.25 = $15.

- The friend who is significantly better played 8 games at 30 minutes per game, so they spent 8 * 30 = 240 minutes. They spent 240 / 4 = 60 quarters, which is equivalent to 60 * $0.25 = $15.

The total cost is $15 + $15 + $15 = $45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, resulting in 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8Z + G = 10.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amount of salt, oil, and citrus zest together is 2Z + 4Z + Z = 7Z. 

So, G = 10 - 7Z.

Since G = 2Z (from S = 2Z), we can substitute 2Z for G, resulting in 10 - 7Z = 2Z.

Now, we can solve for Z: 10 = 9Z, so Z = 10/9.

Now that we know Z, we can find O: O = 4Z = 4(10/9) = 40/9.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 40 by 9, which is approximately 4.44.

The final answer is 4.44."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market.

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:

Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time she took to walk in the two days:

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (in minutes) = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time (in minutes) = 720 minutes

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot at that time.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Then, 1/2 of the cars left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find the difference, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 - 36 = 52

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is $129.00. 

The additional items Angela needs are 2 mirrors, 0 shelves (since she doesn't need any), and 18 pictures. The cost of the additional items is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the mirrors and 18 * $15.00 = $270.00 for the pictures. 

The cost of the chandeliers is the same as the standard chandelier, which is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $129.00 (additional chandeliers) + $270.00 (additional pictures) = $518.00.

The final answer is 518."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 * $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can start by finding the height of the mountain that Saskay can lift. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, we can calculate the speed of each turtle as follows:

Speed of each turtle = Combined speed / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Speed of each turtle
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
So, the total number of slices he initially had is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15 slices.

15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find the milk production per cow: 5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow: 25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows.

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs: 15 - 3 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

The total amount she paid is 4 * $20 = $80.

The cost of the hat is $70.

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. We can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 0.5.

60 * 0.5 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes.

Total = 240 socks + 60 dishes + 30 dishes
Total = 240 + 90
Total = 330

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1615.28."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs purchased per year: 2

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the total time it would take to clean all the rooms and then divide that by 2.

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, the total time to clean all the rooms is 90 * 20 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2. 30 / 2 = 15 hours.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age would be x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age would be x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest whole number. However, given the context, it seems we should consider whole numbers. Let's re-evaluate the equation with whole numbers.

Re-examine the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we should consider whole numbers. Let's try x = 15 and x = 16.

For x = 15: 
- My age: 15
- Brother's age: 15 + 3 = 18
- Sister's age: 15 - 2 = 13
- Mom's age: 3(18) - 1 = 53
- Total: 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99 (not 87)

For x = 16: 
- My age: 16
- Brother's age: 16 + 3 = 19
- Sister's age: 16 - 2 = 14
- Mom's age: 3(19) - 1 = 56
- Total: 16 + 19 + 14 + 56 = 85 (not 87)

For x = 15.6 is not a whole number, and neither are x = 15 or x = 16. However, we can try x = 15.4 and x = 15.8.

For x = 15.4: 
- My age: 15.4
- Brother's age: 15.4 + 3 = 18.4
- Sister's age: 15.4 - 2 = 13.4
- Mom's age: 3(18.4) - 1 = 54.2
- Total: 15.4 + 18.4 + 13.4 + 54.2 = 101.4 (not 87)

For x = 15.8: 
- My age: 15.8
- Brother's age: 15.8 + 3 = 18.8
- Sister's age: 15.8 - 2 = 13.8
- Mom's age: 3(18.8) - 1 = 55.4
- Total: 15.8 + 18.8 + 13.8 + 55.4 = 103. (not 87)

Since we are looking for whole numbers, we can try x = 15.4 and x = 15.8, but neither of these are whole numbers. However, we can try x = 15.4 and x = 15.8, but neither of these are whole numbers.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since he wants 2 glue sticks for each of the 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack. 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 
Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is $800 + $720 = $1520."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total number of oranges given away from the total number she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We can subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the number of yellow cars: 
75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the total amount of jello needed, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide 120 by 10, which equals 12 boxes.

The cost of each box is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we find 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

48"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $21.00 = $63.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

79"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Her hourly rate is $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: 
$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add the scores from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell each chicken for $50, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we can subtract the desired profit from the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, we can divide the total amount he needs to make ($7000) by the number of chickens he plans to sell (180) to find out how much he bought each chicken for:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2 since they sold an equal number. 

32 total glasses / 2 = 16 glasses per boy

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from Julie's sales.

14 (Julie's sales) - 16 (Micah's sales) = -2

However, since Micah sold more glasses than Julie, the result is negative. This means Julie sold 2 fewer glasses than Micah.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to sell the rope to her for $2 per meter. Since the rope is 20 meters long, the total amount she will get from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will get from selling the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

So, 8 + x = 3 * 8

8 + x = 24

x = 24 - 8

x = 16

Therefore, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 * 2 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since Kelly can't have a negative amount of money, this means she has overspent her budget by $91."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys = 200
Toys given away = 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that were successfully arranged. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones were successfully arranged. 

The total number of microphones is 50. 

80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of successfully arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

40 / 2 = 20 

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

2/3 * 6 = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups.

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the speed of the thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can express this relationship as:

Whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11 * Thingamabob's speed = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob's speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob's speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig's speed = 5 * Thingamabob's speed
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which totals $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she spends on carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find out how much she pays for one carrot, we divide the remaining amount by 2 (since she eats 2 carrots a day). $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from each lawn. 

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x. 

The total amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3x * $6 = 18x. 

The total amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5x * $6 = 30x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x. 

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80. 

54x = 80 

x = 80 / 54 

x = 1.48 (approximately) 

Since x is approximately 1.48, she mowed Joe's lawn 1.48 times, Kamala's lawn 3.44 times, and Alba's lawn 7.4 times. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns: 

6 * 1.48 = $8.88 

18 * 3.44 = $61.92 

30 * 7.4 = $222 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $8.88 + $61.92 + $222 = $292.80 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $292.80 = -$212.80 

However, this is not possible since she cannot make a negative amount from lemonade sales. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80. 

We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, Kamala's lawn 3x times, and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x. 

Since the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80, we can set up the equation 54x = 80. 

However, we also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80, we can set up the equation 6x + 18x + 30x = 80. 

However, we also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

We can rewrite the equation as 6x + 18x + 30x = 80.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total monthly hours are 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. 
We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3. 
However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 
So Joseph had 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks. 
Joseph still has 2 notebooks. 
To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's: 12 - 2 = 10.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4 * 2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards. So, 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material are needed for small masks.

For large masks: 8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards. To find the total yards, we can convert 8/3 to a decimal, which is approximately 2.67. So, 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material are needed for large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, we need to find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical eight-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons. 

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month."

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total.

56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * 0.8
Total revenue = 240

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops bought per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * 0.5
Total cost = 150

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = 240 - 150
Profit = 90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially put into the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate that as 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be 5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen on Fridays, but we do know he's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays. We'll assume he's seen 5 movies on Fridays for now.

Colby has $134 left, and each movie ticket costs $10. To find out how many movies he can see, we'll divide $134 by $10.

$134 ÷ $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to 13 movies.

However, we need to consider the movies he's already seen. If he's seen 5 movies on Fridays, he can see 13 - 5 = 8 more movies on Fridays. 

Since Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays, we'll assume he's seen 5 movies on Fridays and 8 movies on other days. 

Colby can see 8 more movies on Fridays and 8 movies on other days. 

The total number of movies Colby can see is 8 + 8 = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria also had 2 balloons.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 23."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables are needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract those from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the 24-hour stay.

For the 12-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since he wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he would stay for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The additional 5 hours would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for the 12-hour stay would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

For the 24-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1600 pesos for the entire 24 hours.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = number of goats * goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = number of sheep * sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also spent 10 dollars on 5 pencils, so he has 250 - 10 = 240 dollars left.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with 240 dollars. 

240 / 25 = 9.6

Since John can't buy a fraction of a pen, he can buy 9 pens with 225 dollars (9 * 25 = 225), and he will have 15 dollars left.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Craig's words: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, Craig's brother's words: 300 + 50 = 350 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the letters in Craig's words and his brother's words. 

300 + 350 = 650

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge. 

The fixed charge is $40. The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor charge is $35 * 2.25 = $78.25. 

The parts charge is $60. 

The total cost is $40 (fixed charge) + $78.25 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $178.25.

The final answer is: $178.25"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams, she has 6 and each costs $1.5, so the total revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and each costs $2, so the total revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and each costs $1.25, so the total revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the root crops together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent this as an equation: 

M = 0.5L

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can represent this as another equation:

M = D - 5

Substituting the value of D (Deanna's age) into the second equation, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

21 = 0.5L

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides by 2:

42 = L

So, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's score: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which means he stapled a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 11:55 p.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 11:55 p.m. and woke up at 2:38 a.m. The time difference between these two times is 2 hours and 43 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was awake (2 hours and 43 minutes) from her usual sleep time (8 hours). 

8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours
6 hours - 43 minutes = 5 hours and 17 minutes

However, we need to add the 5 minutes she woke up early to go to the bathroom. 

5 hours and 17 minutes + 5 minutes = 5 hours and 22 minutes

So, Kim slept for 5 hours and 22 minutes on her bed that day."
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first convert two dozen to the number of cups: 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons: 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and now has 10 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils, we add the number of measuring cups and measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, there are 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

The remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these are to her boyfriend, so 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is to her boyfriend.

The final answer is 1."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then use the given information to calculate Shawna's age. 

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know Shawna's age, and we are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day.

4 * 31 = 124

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins must have received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting the expression for X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 225."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net distance traveled south is 300 - 36 = 264 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75. So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, John paid $2100 for all the phones.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since Robert is building a fence around his garden, we need to add the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Richard has x cherries. 
Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 20
So Richard has 20 cherries. 
Since Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherries, Jerry must have 30 - 20 = 10 cherries.

The difference between the number of cherries Robert has and Jerry has is 30 - 10 = 20."
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: (10 * $6) + (11 * $15) = $60 + $165 = $225
- Sunday: (15 * $6) + (15 * $15) = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen. However, each bottle is 8 ounces, so we need to divide 32 by 8 to find out how many bottles she'll need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2 gives B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The number of students leaving early is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each flower plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each flower and the space between them:
- Each flower is 12 inches wide
- There is 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each flower
- Total space required for each flower and the space between them = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space required for each flower and the space between them:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a flower, she can fit 44 flowers in her bed.

Now, calculate the total cost of the flowers:
- Number of flowers Pat can buy = 44
- Cost of each flower = $6
- Total cost = 44 * 6 = $264

The final answer is: $264"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used by sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is:
30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

0.5 -> 0

So, Jessica can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute) to get 15 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the peeling time to the cooking time. So, the total time is 15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, and it was off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by:
2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a variable 'x'. The problem asks for the difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature, which is 'x - (x - 14)'. 

Simplifying this expression, we get:
x - x + 14
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 0.75 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany combined.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam received $6 from his mother and twice as much from his father, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

First, we add the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract this sum from the total age to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 20 - 7 = 13.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can set up an equation to find the average age. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. We know that Helene's age is 2x. The sum of their ages is 13, so we can write the equation: 2x + x = 13.

Combine like terms: 3x = 13.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 13/3.

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age: 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3.

Since we know the average age, we can find the sum of the ages of the four children: 4x = 4 * (13/3) = 52/3.

Now, we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 52/3 - 7 = 37/3.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 37/3 - 26/3 = 11/3.

11/3 = 3.67"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

First, we find the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies.

Then, we divide the total number of cookies by 2 to find out how many cookies were given to the church: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were in the church: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, there are 4 slices in total. Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly earnings = (Cost to rent the studio per week) + (Cost per student per week)
Weekly earnings = $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) * 3 (days) 
Weekly earnings = $25 + $45
Weekly earnings = $70

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $70 * 4
Monthly earnings = $280

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $280."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by the formula V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

8230 * 0.10 = $823

The cost to fill the pool is $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x + (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x + (0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

Combine like terms:

(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) * x = 0.28

Now, we can calculate the value of (0.91)^5 and (0.93)^3:

(0.91)^5 ≈ 0.5905
(0.93)^3 ≈ 0.8573

Substitute these values back into the equation:

0.5905 * (1 + 0.8573) * x = 0.28

0.5905 * 1.8573 * x = 0.28

1.095 * x = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 1.095

x ≈ 0.255

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 25.5%.

The final answer is: 25.5"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly income is $400 + $15 * 40 = $400 + $600 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly income of $1000. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year and add it to the previous year's price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 6 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The number of guests remaining is now 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, she will get 0.75 * 24 = 18 points from the easy questions.

The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since they are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12L. The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4S (since each small stuffed animal costs $4).

We can set up the equation: 12L + 4S = 120.

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, let's multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 

40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30.

40 dwarves can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can use the price per sandwich from the first two packages to find the price of the third package. 

The third package has 8 sandwiches, so the price would be 8 * $1.50 = $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Now, let's add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.36 + 0.1 = 0.82

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.82 * 100 = 82%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 82%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000 * 4 years = $300,000

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000 per year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the fabric is calculated by multiplying the length and width, so the area is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $32.5 / 3 = $10.83

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $10.83."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12:
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 
The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.
The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 0.375 days.

Now, multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day worked:

21 days * 0.375 days = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total days worked by 24:

7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. 

Area of a single tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt
Total tiles required = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles required by the cost per tile.

Total cost = Total tiles required * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles * $12
Total cost = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a week:

- 4 twin beds * 2 sets of sheets per twin bed = 8 sets of twin sheets per week
- 1 king bed * 1 set of sheets per king bed = 1 set of king sheets per week
- Total sets of sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sets per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year is:
9 sets per week * 52 weeks per year = 468 sets per year

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a year:
- 2 twin sets per load
- 1 king set per load
- Total sets per load = 3 sets per load
- Total loads per year = 468 sets per year / 3 sets per load = 156 loads per year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300/hour, so the cost of the visit is $300/2 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the cast is $200.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour, and the visit is 2 hours long. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $200 (cast) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

First, we find 20% of 80 emails, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 28 - 20 = 8 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48.

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $48 = $173.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7.

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters. 

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the waiting time for Paul. Paul waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to leave (65 minutes), then waits for the third train to leave (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes).

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x. The selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches, which is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.

"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we have already accounted for 150 + 45 = 195 bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 195 = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 7 days in a week. So, the total minutes in a week is 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes.

The total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week by adding the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total minutes spent on learning per week = 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total hours spent on learning per week = 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of it, the amount left after they ate is x/2.

We know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate is x/2. Since the velociraptors ate half of this, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 540

This means that the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 540 kilograms. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can set up the equation:

540 = x/2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 1080

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. Since the friend can choose any of the remaining sodas, the probability of choosing a shaken soda is 2 out of the total 9 remaining sodas.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/9) * 100 = 22.22%

The final answer is 22.22."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00. So, the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This also means that 6 jellyfish are small and stay blue.

We can set up an equation based on the information: 

x/15 = 6 (since 6 large jellyfish changed color)

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given relationships. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age: 4 * 2 = 8.
Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3 to find Caroline's age: 8 * 3 = 24.

Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000
Annual expenses = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Annual savings needed = Annual expenses - Annual savings
Annual savings needed = $40,000 - $20,000 = $20,000

Since Lauren wants to save for 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save:
Total savings needed = Annual savings needed * Number of years
Total savings needed = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Now, we can calculate how many years she needs to work to save the required amount:
Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
Number of years = $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Since she already has 20 years of savings, we need to subtract the current year from the total number of years:
Years worked = Total years - Current year
Years worked = 20 - 1 = 19 years

Lauren needs to work for 19 more years to save the required amount for her retirement.

The final answer is: 19"

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys to calculate the total population. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and we are given that this equals 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total population as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x: x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total population: 
Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

Total height of heels = (3 x 4 inches) + (3 x 2 inches) = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Total number of heels = 3 + 3 = 6

Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Total number of heels = 18 inches / 6 = 3 inches

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. So, the total amount she spent on the books is $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 

Let's assume the fifth worker produces x toys per hour. Since the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400, we can set up the equation: 
20 + 20x = 400

Now, we can solve for x:
20x = 400 - 20
20x = 380
x = 380 / 20
x = 19

So, the fifth worker produces 19 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 45 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 60 + 45 = 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of his stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5 to find the 2nd fastest car's speed.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, let's denote the time she spends on the beach as 't' minutes. 

The distance covered on the beach is 2 miles, and the distance covered on the sidewalk is 1 mile. 

We know that time = distance / speed. Since the speed is twice as fast on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk will be half the time spent on the beach. 

So, the time spent on the sidewalk is t/2 minutes. 

The total time spent on the walk is 40 minutes, which is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Therefore, t + t/2 = 40. 

Solving for t, we get 3t/2 = 40, which gives t = 80/3 minutes. 

Now, we know that the time spent on the sidewalk is t/2 = 40/3 minutes. 

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 80/3 + 40/3 = 120/3 = 40 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. Since he has two mugs, and we know one mug is 33 degrees, we can assume the other mug is also full, as he is able to drink the water after pouring from both mugs.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. 

Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug. The total amount of water he has now is 5 ounces. 

Since he can drink the water, the temperature of the water he has now must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) = 5 * 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the second mug is at least 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals: 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. There are 9 bagels in each pack, and there are 4 packs. So, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels. $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 3 scoops require 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, 1 scoop requires 3 / 3 = 1 potato. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 1 scoop requires 1 potato, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1 potato/scoop = 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons in a year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is a multiplier for the ratio. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x. 

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus by multiplying the ratio of women (9) by x. 

Initial number of women = 9x
Initial number of women = 9 * 6
Initial number of women = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

Number of women who have remained = Initial number of women - 20
Number of women who have remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who have remained = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first calculate the total number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 3: 
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold: 
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each, we can divide the total amount by the cost per rock to find the number of rocks he buys:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the loss:

$84 - $100 = -$16

Adam loses $16.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected 5 more seashells than Jim, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by adding 5 to Jim's total. 

Carlos collected 27 + 5 = 32 seashells.

We are also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide Carlos' total by 2.

Carrey collected 32 / 2 = 16 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 32 (Carlos) + 16 (Carrey) = 75 seashells.

Seashells per person = 75 / 3 = 25.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we can add the lengths of both songs to find the total time.

Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand for one person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that one bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

To find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the energy demand, we divide the total energy demand by the energy covered by one bottle: 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we subtract the number of bottles needed from the production capacity to find out how many more bottles they need to produce: 2300 - 4200 is not correct, as it would result in a negative number. This is because the production capacity is greater than the required number of bottles. 

The correct calculation is: 2300 - 4200 is not possible, but we can calculate the difference between the required number of bottles and the production capacity: 4200 - 2300 = 1900."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of purple babies wearing a bow.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2/3 (blue) = 8/3.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 8) * 100 = 75%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (17150 - 200) = 10 * 16900 = 169000 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 169000 = 225700

Adding the 1000 fruits produced in the 10th year, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is 225700 + 1000 = 226700.

"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express this as R = 4B. 

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express this as B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can express this as R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the expressions for R and B into the equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37. 

Since B = Y - 7, we can substitute this into the equation to get 4(Y - 7) + Y + Y = 37. 

Expanding the equation, we get 4Y - 28 + Y + Y = 37. 

Combining like terms, we get 6Y - 28 = 37. 

Adding 28 to both sides of the equation, we get 6Y = 65. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get Y = 65/6, which is approximately 10.83 centimeters.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7. 

B = 10.83 - 7, which is approximately 3.83 centimeters.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope by substituting B into the equation R = 4B. 

R = 4 * 3.83, which is approximately 15.32 centimeters.

The final answer is 15.32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Initially, Ronnie had $5. After giving $3 to her sister, Ronnie is left with:

5 - 3 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into three equal parts - red, white, and purple. 

Let's denote the amount of paint used for each color as 'x'. Since there are three colors and they are equal, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, so the other half is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. This 6 pints is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Since 2 pints are used for each of the three colors (red, white, and purple), we can set up the equation 3x = 6 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 6 / 3 = 2.

Since x represents the amount of paint used for each color, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20)
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box for $1:

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Cost per pod
Cost per pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = 120 / $0.12
Number of cycles = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the amount of chalk used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. 

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. 

He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. 

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 13 days."

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

$500 ÷ 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

$27,000 ÷ $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5,400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's calculate the net rate of building snowballs per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt in the same hour. So, the net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by the net rate (12 snowballs per hour). 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

It will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'x':

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation should be: 
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house's height after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this still doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation again.

The correct calculation should be:
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house's height after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since the height of the second floor is 240 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first find the total number of miles all the dogs need to walk per day. 

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total number of miles they need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, we can set up the equation: (1 + 4 + 3 + x) / 4 = 3, where x is the number of miles the last dog needs.

Simplifying the equation, we get (8 + x) / 4 = 3.

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get 8 + x = 12.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get x = 4.

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first calculate the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72

Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Then, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine first. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3.

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we add the amount of the first medicine to this result to get the total amount of one dose.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in those months is 25 * 11 = $275.

Now, we add the interest to the total amount he pays in the first 11 months: 275 + 6 = $281.

The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the total amount owed minus the amount paid in the first 11 months: 300 - 281 = $19.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $19 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers changed by both Jordan and his wife.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan is also changing diapers, we need to subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total to find out how many Jordan changes. 

10 (total diaper changes) - 5 (diaper changes by wife) = 5 diapers per day.

Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then find the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans is 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop.

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, we need to find the number of people who entered at the second station. Since 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first stop entered the bus at the second station, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.

Total number of people after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

Now, the number of people on the bus doubled at the third station. To find the number of people on the bus after the third stop, we multiply the total number of people after the second stop by 2.

Total number of people after the third stop = 90 * 2 = 180

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, we need to find the remaining spaces on the bus.

Remaining spaces on the bus = 200 - 180 = 20

"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * 5 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. 

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. The total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * 3 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all groups to try the escape room. Each group has 45 minutes, and there are 3 groups:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 4 and then multiply the result by 3, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants (80) by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

Total rain on Tuesday = 4 + 1 = 5 inches"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 

$75 * 0.20 = $15

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for each of the 10 fingers (5 fingers for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the services plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% less than the standard rate, we can calculate it as follows:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we can add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the total number of books can be represented as:

B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

(3B/2) - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

3B/2 = 115

Multiply both sides by 2:

3B = 230

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 76.67

Since the number of books must be a whole number, we can round down to 76 books for the bottom shelf.

Now, we can calculate the number of books for each shelf:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelf: 76/2 = 38 books
Top shelf: 76 - 5 = 71 books

Now, we can calculate the total number of books per bookcase:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelf: 38 books
Top shelf: 71 books

Since each bookcase has 2 middle shelves, we can calculate the total number of books per bookcase:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelves: 2 * 38 = 76 books
Top shelf: 71 books

Total books per bookcase: 76 + 76 + 71 = 223 books

Since 223 is more than 110, we need 2 bookcases to hold all the books.

Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right in the first test from the total number of questions:

Questions needed in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions needed in the second test = 89 - 42
Questions needed in the second test = 47

The final answer is 47."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent it as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is equal to 116. 

The equation can be written as: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the equation 5s - 4: 
5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4
Points scored per game: 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game
Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up one marble that wasn't a marble, but a bead. So, he got rid of that one, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 

For the other 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There is one flashlight for each of the 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights.

In total, Brianna's family is using 36 candles and 4 flashlights.

"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week:
24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time. Therefore, the total time it takes Phineas to return home is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"To find the total number of boxes Bob needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project will be $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts: 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can find the total number of words in 10 pages by multiplying the number of words per page by 10.

Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages by dividing the total number of words by his words per minute.

Time = Total words / Words per minute = 4500 words / 0.16 words/second = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60.

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60 = 4.69 minutes

The final answer is: 4.69"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people for the first three days.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
Total number of people for the week = 260 + 300 = 560

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 560."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in the first 90 seconds is 80 + 240 = 320.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate of the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in 2 minutes is 320 + 120 = 440.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.
   The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons. 

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

So, the total number of lemons required is 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, let's multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

There are 43 pink candies."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time spent per week by the number of weeks: 360 minutes * 4 weeks = 1440 minutes

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 1440 minutes."
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert this to a numerical value by multiplying 3 by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12). 

3 * 12 = 36

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5.

36 * 0.5 = 18

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original number of seeds in the small sunflower.

36 + 18 = 54

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds. To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower.

36 + 54 = 90

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $8 + $24 = $32.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: 335"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 10 * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds. 
The cost of honey for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The total cost is 20 pounds * $6 per pound + 15 pounds * $8 per pound + 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $500 - $440 = $60.

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets for herself and her sister: 2 * $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total amount spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:
$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total, leaving him with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 6 + 7 + 2 = 15."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (the original number of beakers requested, 7, minus the number he gathered, 5).

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance (2 miles) in the same amount of time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles. 

We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Now, we can calculate Vanessa's time to run 4 miles. Since she runs twice as far as Aaron, her speed is half of Aaron's speed. Therefore, her speed is 8 minutes per mile / 2 = 4 minutes per mile.

To find the time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles, we multiply her speed by the distance: 4 miles * 4 minutes per mile = 16 minutes.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to first calculate the daily revenue. 

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10, and the cost of the wine is $5. 

So, the daily revenue is 6 * ($10 + $5) = 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is 2 * $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first isolating 'b' in the first equation: b = 20 - c.

Now, substitute 'b' in the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70.

Combine like terms: -2c + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2c = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: c = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
