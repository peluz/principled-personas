"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

She lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately. 

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

The total number of bolts is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the cost of repairs from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Cost of repairs
Profit = $200,000 - $50,000
Profit = $150,000

The final answer is 150,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

3 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/week

James runs 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to her chickens. 

She gave 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 

15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we can find out how many cups of feed she needs for all the chickens by multiplying the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken gets.

20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already given 40 cups of feed, we need to subtract that from the total amount of feed needed.

60 - 40 = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses.

The first glass costs $5.

For the remaining 15 glasses, each costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The total cost of the remaining glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all glasses is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 60% of the file (200 GB * 0.6 = 120 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the first download is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Then, the system restarts and Carla has to download the remaining 80 GB (200 GB - 120 GB) at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the second download is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Adding the time taken for both downloads, we get 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

The total time taken to download the file is 100 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, we add up all the distances: 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit per year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90.
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The annual profit is the revenue minus the cost: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90. To do this, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (2/3x - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

x/3 = 6

Then, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Future value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Future value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,125) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from teaching would be: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $20/hour = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from coaching would be: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $30/hour = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 x 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find the total time Marissa has spent walking so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent walking so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the total distance is 12 miles and the total time is 2 hours. We can plug these values into the formula to find the required average speed.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
4 = 12 / 2
4 = 6

However, this is the required average speed, not the speed for the remaining distance. To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we need to subtract the distance already covered from the total distance and divide it by the time already spent.

Distance covered so far = 4 + 2 = 6 miles
Time spent so far = 2 hours
Remaining distance = 12 - 6 = 6 miles

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we have 24 liters of the mixture. To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 26/3 liters of water, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of water in 24 liters of the mixture.

Let's set up the proportion: (26/3) / 24 = x / 24

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: (26/3) * 24 = x
x = (26 * 24) / 3
x = 624 / 3
x = 208

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 208 liters.

The final answer is: 208"
"To find the answer, we need to know the age of Raymond. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 31 - (31 - 6) = 31 - 25 = 6

So, Raymond is 6 years old.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age from the son's age:

Raymond's age - son's age = 6 - 23 = -17

Since we can't have a negative age, we need to subtract 6 from 23 to find the son's age when Raymond was 6 years old:

23 - 6 = 17

So, Raymond's son was 17 years old when Raymond was 6 years old.

The question asks how many years ago Raymond's son was born, not how old he was. To find the answer, we need to subtract the son's age from the year Raymond had the son:

Year Raymond had the son - son's age = 23 - 17 = 6

So, Raymond's son was born 6 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.

His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75). 

Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop. 

He traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 
Then, he traveled 15 miles before his second stop. 

So, the total distance before his second stop is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance before his second stop from the total distance: 60 - 35 = 25 miles.

25"
"To find the cost of the boots, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost the same amount, we can set up an equation: 

Boots + $99 = Total cost

We know that the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost the same amount, so we can say that the boots cost $99.

The final answer is: $99"
"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to find their current ages. 

Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

Their total age is 162, so we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 80 + 20 = 100.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 100 + 100 = 280.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3: 280 / 3 = 93.33.

The average guess is 93.33."
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours per week.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know the number of silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins: x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of 40 jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels to find Siobhan's jewels. 
25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The cost of one yogurt is $5.00. So, the total cost of 60 yogurts is 60 * $5.00 = $300.00.

The final answer is: $300."
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x $15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. 

To find out how much money he spent on the video games, we subtract the money he had left from the money he made from selling the Lego sets: $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games, we need to subtract this amount from the total money he made from selling the Lego sets to find out how much he has left: $195 - $35 = $160.

Now, we know that he spent $160 on video games and had $5 left. This means he had $160 + $5 = $165 initially. 

To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we divide the initial amount by the price of each Lego set: $165 ÷ $15 = 11.

So, John had 11 Lego sets initially."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Since he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours.

Speed = Total miles / Total hours
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. 

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and she spends a total of 6 hours, we can calculate the time she spends running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we know Dana's running speed is 4 times faster than her walking speed. Since her walking speed is 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 4 * 3 = 12 miles per hour.

Distance traveled running = Speed * Time = 12 miles/hour * 2 hours = 24 miles
Distance traveled walking = Speed * Time = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled running + Distance traveled walking = 24 miles + 12 miles = 36 miles

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we multiply Suzy's age by 2 to find Ben's iPhone age.
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from Polly where she can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. 

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames are within 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon when holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

Total number of pieces = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of remaining pieces = 14
Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces - Number of remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since you can have 0.8 servings, and each serving is 5 grams, you can have 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total cost = Number of candles * (Beeswax + Wicks)
Total cost = 20 * ($10.00)
Total cost = $200.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The negative sign indicates that Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had initially and how many she used. 

We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. 

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes to put on the cups of coffee. 

We also know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the ones she used minus the ones she had left should equal the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 80 + 220 - 23 = x 

Simplifying the equation: 277 = x 

Therefore, the package she purchased had 277 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie: 
200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie: 
40 * 1.5 = 60.

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per tie: 
10 * 60 = 600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties: 
200 + 600 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. 

First, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot to get 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units, which is 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels at 10 mph, we can multiply the time by the speed to get the distance. 

Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time it takes to travel back. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes Tom to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he's removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he's removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days.
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480
- Friday has lower revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue.
- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we multiply 12 by 3 to get 36. 

Now, we add the 7 kittens the sisters adopted to the 36 kittens Patchy had, and the 12 kittens Trixie had. 7 + 36 + 12 = 55.

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so we subtract 2 from 30. 

30 - 2 = 28

Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops."

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

First, subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, divide the result by the weight of a single box:

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of clusters and the individual fruit.

There are 6 clusters with 20 fruit each, so 6 x 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual fruit, we get 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 

25 (total oranges) - 7 (not good oranges) = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 good oranges.

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the next 10 years.

In the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is 20 * $50,000 = $1,000,000.

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000.

Now, we need to find the value of the pension after 30 years. The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000, and she receives 5% of this value per year. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is $50,000. 

To find the value of the pension after 30 years, we need to add the annual pension she receives after 20 years to the value of the pension she receives in the next 10 years. The value of the pension she receives in the next 10 years is 10 * $50,000 = $500,000. 

So, the total value of the pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000. 

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is 5% of $1,500,000, which is $75,000.

$75,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

The first half of the year is 6 months. The streaming company charged her $140 per month. So, the amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
6 * 140 = 840

The second half of the year is also 6 months. The streaming company charged her 10% less money on the second half of the year. 
10% of 140 is 0.1 * 140 = 14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = 126

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
840 + 126 = 966

So, Aleena paid a total of $966 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we subtract that from the total capacity of the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Now, we can divide the amount of gas left in the tank by the distance she has already traveled to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank.

8 gallons (gas left) ÷ 100 miles (distance traveled) = 0.08 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive 0.08 miles per gallon."
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on both activities per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading."
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams * 5 players = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by all schools is the sum of players and coaches, which is 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. There are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

180 / 5 = 36

There are 36 teachers."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Weekly allowance: $5

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. 

She teaches 5 classes each weekday, which is 5 days (Monday to Friday). 
5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,475.00

$129 + $92 = $221

Tommy raises $221."
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

Since there's a 2% interest for each unit, we need to calculate the interest for each month. 

The interest for the first month is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.
The interest for the second month is 2% of $150 + $3 (since the interest is compounded), which is 0.02 * $153 = $3.06.
The interest for the third month is 2% of $153 + $3.06 (since the interest is compounded), which is 0.02 * $155.06 = $3.10.

Now, let's add the total cost of the cell phones and the interest for each month:
Month 1: $150 + $3 = $153
Month 2: $153 + $3.06 = $156.06
Month 3: $156.06 + $3.10 = $159.16

So, Shiela will pay $153, $156.06, and $159.16 for 3 months, respectively.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has 16 square footage. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage, the third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After that, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in a year.

The total amount of dog food she will use in the first year is 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year by 110 cups/bag to find out how many bags she will need:

910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags

So, Cecilia will need approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much laundry David does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find out how much David does. 

400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much Raymond does. 

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find out how much Raymond does. 

400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now we can find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. 

200 - 100 = 100 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages.

For the 3-for-$2.50 package, we divide 18 by 3 to get 6 packages. 
6 * $2.50 = $15

For the 2-for-$1 package, we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 packages. 
9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in the 2-for-$1 package is the better deal.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better deal from the cost of the other deal.
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price = $100
Discount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how much water was left, we need to first calculate how much water the two girls got together. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we multiply 1/6 by 24. 
1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

So, the two girls got 4 liters together. 

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got to the 4 liters the girls got. 
4 + 6 = 10 liters

So, 10 liters of water were left.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2. 

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. 
4 times 125 pounds is 500 pounds. 
500 pounds minus 2 pounds is 498 pounds. 

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

125 pounds (Grace) + 498 pounds (Alex) = 623 pounds.

The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. We can write this as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the time each alarm rang and add them together.

The first alarm rang 4 times.

The second alarm rang for 3 times as long as the first, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third alarm rang for half as long as the second, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the times together: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's assume Gerald's original speed is x. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed is x + 2. 

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since speed is distance/time, we can set up the equation: 

400 / (x + 2) = 400 / x = 38 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

400x = 400(x + 2) 

Expanding the right side, we get: 

400x = 400x + 800 

Subtracting 400x from both sides, we get: 

0 = 800 

This doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate our equation. Let's try a different approach. 

Let's say Gerald's original time is y. Then Lee's original time is y + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: 

400 / (y + 2) = 400 / 38 

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply: 

400(38) = 400(y + 2) 

Expanding the right side, we get: 

15200 = 400y + 800 

Subtracting 800 from both sides, we get: 

15000 = 400y 

Dividing both sides by 400, we get: 

y = 37.5 

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can find his new time. Since his speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 10% less than his original time. 

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 37.5 = 33.75 

The final answer is 33.75."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

She initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants:

Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time he watched on other days from the total: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he wants to bake 2x cookies.

However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants on the left side:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas first. 

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it's 10 x $0.20 = $2.00.

The total cost after the cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll-up and then add them together.

For Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
For Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups they ate.

Average number of roll-ups: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet. 

Since the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can divide 64 by 16 to find out how many times she rowed 20 feet. 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Julia rowed 20 feet 4 times. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to find out how many 10 feet segments are in 20 feet. 

20 / 10 = 2

So, for every 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since Julia rowed 20 feet 4 times, she took on 2 * 4 = 8 liters of water."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons per day and multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants per day (2) by the number of days (15). 

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

However, 5 flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract those from the total.

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is 1.5 times the cost price. 
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $10 = $15 per board. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $16 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenues from the two types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 ÷ 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total number of teaspoons of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair and then multiply by the number of children.

Total cost = 2 * 60 * 3
Total cost = 360

John paid $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to subtract the number of containers already present from the total number of containers on the second day.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, and each container has 5 vehicles. 

First, we find the total number of containers on the second day by dividing the total number of vehicles by 5:
30 / 5 = 6

Now, we subtract the number of containers already present (2) from the total number of containers on the second day (6):
6 - 2 = 4

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and Lylah's salary was $30769.23. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% of his original salary:
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + 0.4($40000)
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $16000
Adrien's current salary = $56000

Lylah's salary four years later can be found by increasing her original salary by 40%:
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + 0.4($30769.23)
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.6912
Lylah's current salary = $43076.9212

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of their current salaries:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $56000 + $43076.9212
Total salary ≈ $99076.9212

The final answer is: 99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to multiply the number of pads of paper he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month.

2 * 4 = 8

Miguel uses 8 sheets of paper every month."
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total number of fruits: 13 + 14 = 27

The total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

So, Sadie slept 29 hours throughout the week.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she runs 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she runs 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. 

So, 20 letters were stamped. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters increased by 20. 

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract 20 from 30. 

30 - 20 = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Then, her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had before using any was x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left before setting the table was (x + 5) - 3.

We know that after setting the table, she had 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought initially had 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them have.

"To find the cost of each item, we need to know the cost of a watermelon. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$. 

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges cost 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

Total time spent on patients = 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients = 500 people * $200/person = $100,000
Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000
Total revenue = $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Since the cost is not given, we assume it's the same as the revenue from doctors, which is $30,000.
Profit = $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000

The hospital makes $100,000 profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   Since there are 60 elves, a third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

So, there are 30 elves left.

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total:

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the total number of Scottish unicorns. Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of unicorns by 3.

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9

2. Now that we know there are 9 Scottish unicorns, we can find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

Female Scottish unicorns = Scottish unicorns * 2/3 = 9 * 2/3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, we can represent the number of queens as x. This means there are 2x baby bees. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can represent the number of worker bees as 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

We can write this as an equation: 4x + 2x + x = 700.

Combine like terms: 7x = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens (x = 100), we can find the number of baby bees (2x = 200) and worker bees (4x = 400).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 

1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.

Now, Debra sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. We already know 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 6 hours. 

Now, 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, and 15 of those were the ones that left in the first 6 hours. So, 60 - 15 = 45 bees left in the next 6 hours that hadn't already returned.

Now, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. So, 15 + 45 = 60 bees return to the hive in the next 6 hours.

Distance in feet = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time (36 minutes) is less than Tim's time (40 minutes), Steve will win the race. 

The winner will be waiting for the loser. Since Steve won, he will be waiting for Tim. 

The time Tim will be waiting = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes."
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to calculate the total cost of the cookies first. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since you can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll ignore this part and continue with the rest of the information.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, but we don't know what the remaining fries are yet. Let's call the remaining fries after the seagull ate 'x'. The raccoon ate 2/3 * x fries.
7. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are x - 2/3 * x = 1/3 * x.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 1/3 * x - 1 fries.
9. We know that 1/3 * x - 1 = 5 fries. To find x, we can solve for x: 1/3 * x = 5 + 1 = 6. x = 6 * 3 = 18.

So, Dave bought 18 french fries.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours in class on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours in class on these days.

Now, let's add the hours he spends in class on each day: 
3 hours (Mondays) + 3 hours (Wednesdays) + 3 hours (Fridays) = 9 hours
9 hours + 4 hours (Tuesdays) + 4 hours (Thursdays) = 17 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by 16:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit, which is inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 2 feet is equal to 24 inches.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches per baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 100 yards, and then she ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, she ran 100 + 80 = 180 yards per round. She ran 34 times, so she ran 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly is the winner. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

Now, let's add up the costs: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles he initially saw.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is:
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish, 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses, and 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months.

Initial price = $20
Increase every 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

After 2 months, the price will be $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, the price will be $24 + $4 = $28
After 6 months, the price will be $28 + $4 = $32
After 8 months, the price will be $32 + $4 = $36
After 10 months, the price will be $36 + $4 = $40
After 12 months, the price will be $40 + $4 = $44
After 14 months, the price will be $44 + $4 = $48
After 16 months, the price will be $48 + $4 = $52
After 18 months, the price will be $52 + $4 = $56
After 20 months, the price will be $56 + $4 = $60
After 22 months, the price will be $60 + $4 = $64

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to know the value of one action figure. 

Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15. 

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll also costs $15. 

One red car costs $4. 

Now, let's add up the values of all the toys: 
5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
3 action figures = $15
1 doll = $15
Total value = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

The total value of all the toys is $50."
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35/hour, so the total amount she'll lose is 3 * $35 = $105.

Now, let's calculate the money she'll have if she hires the accountant. She'll pay $90 for the accountant's services.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira started with €1500. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from her initial budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets from babysitting.

She needs 15 Spanish flans, and each flan requires 3 eggs. So, the total number of eggs needed is 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs from babysitting, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets from babysitting: 45 / 9 = 5.

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's break down the problem. 

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation: S = 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2 to it.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 x 8 = 16.

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 x 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 days in a weekend, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.
Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 x 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 x 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to find the ages of each bird first.

We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Two is 19 years old, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of the two older birds. However, we don't have the total age of the two older birds. 

We can find the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red by adding their ages: 19 + 16 = 35 years.

Now, we can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red from the total age of all four birds. However, we still don't have the total age of all four birds.

We can find the age of the fourth bird by subtracting the ages of Sally Four and Sally Two from the total age of Sally Two and Granny Red: 35 - 8 = 27 years.

Now we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and the fourth bird (27).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 27 = 70 years.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment:
$1000 (minimum payment) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

Now, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the yearly payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply those times by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time to peel one potato into seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time to peel all the potatoes: 90 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all the potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Now, we add the time to peel and cut all the potatoes: 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time into minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the price of one gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

They made $25 in profit, and their cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $5 = $30.

Now, we know that the price of one gallon is $10, and they made $30 in total revenue. So, the number of gallons they made is $30 / $10 = 3 gallons.

Since they spent $5 per gallon on lemons and sugar, the total amount they spent on lemons is 3 * $5 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to first find the total number of Chinese people on the team.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these two amounts from his total salary: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

This is the amount left after rent and car fuel expenses. 

Zaid donates half of this remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract this donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final answer is 350."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation: 5x = 200. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 40. This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15.
   - Since Mark was 5 years older than that, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
3. Since Mark is two years younger than Jean, Jean's age two years ago would be 20 + 2 = 22.
4. To find Jean's current age, we add 2 to Jean's age two years ago: 22 + 2 = 24.

The first team's total time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The second team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The total time for the second team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in their total times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events. 

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the events are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities.

Difference in probabilities = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
= 0.5 - 0.25
= 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Difference in probabilities as a percentage = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw used is 160, the number of straw left for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find out the number of rats, we divide the total number of straw left for rats by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are in 3 cages, we divide 15 by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage. 

15 / 3 = 5.

The answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest she owes for 3 months. 

First, we find the interest for one month: 
$100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation. The cost of buying the bags is $20x, and the cost of transportation is $2x. So, the total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

$20.25 (tickets) - $4.50 (difference) = $15.75 (food)

Now, we need to add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $33 (ride 1) + $33 (ride 2) = $88.00

Since they are splitting the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

$88.00 ÷ 3 = $29.33

So, each of them paid $29.33."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of minutes he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per minute.

He collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute. So, in 180 minutes, he can collect 2 x 180 = 360 peaches.

The answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

First, we multiply the total amount of insects needed per week by 10 (the number of ducks) to get the total amount of insects needed per week: 
3.5 pounds * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7 to get the amount needed per day:
35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he planted and the total number of trees he chopped down.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees died. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees died.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the initial number of trees: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pink and white flamingos are in Sue's yard at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The answer is 24."
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. 

She needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Violetta has $20. 
Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the cost of one pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots available.

Total carrots available = 200 pounds
Total carrots given to restaurants = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Carrots not used = Total carrots available - Total carrots given to restaurants
Carrots not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

The answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards she collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find out how much Mark makes from Publisher A.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, we can multiply the amount Mark makes from Publisher A by 2.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amount Mark makes from both publishers to find out his total weekly earnings.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: 
$5000 (reward) + $2000 (weekly salary) = $7000

Since the raise is 5% of his weekly salary, we need to calculate 5% of $2000:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100

Now, we add the raise to his weekly salary:
$2000 (weekly salary) + $100 (raise) = $2100 (new weekly salary)

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the new weekly salary by 52:
$2100 * 52 = $109,200

Now, we add the monetary reward to his total earnings:
$109,200 (total earnings) + $5000 (reward) = $110,200

The total amount of money John made that year is $110,200."
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Then, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them up.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. Since he ate 3 omelets, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, which used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she initially had and then add the pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. 
Total pens initially = 22 + 10 = 32 pens

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.
She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Total pens bought = 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 66 pens

Now, we add the total pens initially and the total pens bought to find the current total.
Total pens now = 32 (initial pens) + 66 (pens bought) = 98 pens

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the average of the six tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by 6. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
438 - 71 = 367

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
To do that, we multiply 93 by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, let's subtract 367 from 558 to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test: 
558 - 367 = 191

The final answer is 191."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to find the total.
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 3 plates. 

So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups: $16800 / 240 = $70.

The final answer is 70."
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate how much money she needs to save for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 for each babysitting job and $4 for each lawn mowing job. To find out how many babysitting jobs she needs to do to earn $40, we divide $40 by $5, which is 8.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing jobs. Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing job, we need to find out how many lawn mowing jobs she needs to do to earn the remaining $30 ($40 - $10 she already had). 

$30 / $4 = 7.5. Since we can't have half a lawn mowing job, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

So, Sara needs to do 8 babysitting jobs and 8 lawn mowing jobs to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'. 

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5(r + 2). 

We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so we can set up the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. 

Since the park is a rectangle, we have two lengths and two widths. The formula for the perimeter is: 
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the perimeter, we can find out how many hours Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find out how many customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day. 

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it has 4x - 16 gallons now.

We know that the big pool has 4x - 16 gallons and it has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the equation: 4x - 16 = 4x. 

However, this equation doesn't make sense because it would mean the big pool has the same amount of water it had 4 minutes ago, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. 

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water. The big pool has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 16 = 4x - 64.

Adding 16 to both sides, we get: 2x = 4x - 48.

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get: -2x = -48.

Dividing both sides by -2, we get: x = 24.

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons, it now has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months and subtract that from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.
Total amount to return = $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = Total amount to return - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses in the vase. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the information given. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3. 
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3. 
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

Initial water = 120 liters
Water used = 90 liters
Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire type) + 20 (grass type) + 46 (water type) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is 48%."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal first. 

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. 
The total cost of these extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00. 
He also adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extras is $4.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 
Adding this to the base burrito, the total cost so far is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. 
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost is now $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. 
He has a gift card for $5.00, so he will pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate the total number of pieces they can place per minute. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide 360 by 6 to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

The answer is 1."
"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many melons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested melons from the total.

Remaining melons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining melons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many melons were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested melons from the remaining melons.

Melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collected 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs. 

First, we know there are 50 ants. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2. 

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of ants and bugs to find the total number of insects. 

Total number of insects = 50 (ants) + 25 (bugs) = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to subtract the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave from the total number of penguins.

First, we find one-third of 36, which is 36 / 3 = 12. This is the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave.

Now, we subtract 12 from 36: 36 - 12 = 24.

So, 24 penguins are still sunbathing.

24"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7. 

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. 

So, his girlfriend eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes the vine produces per week. The vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes he eats per week by the number of tomatoes the vine produces per week.

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) / 3 tomatoes/week (vine) = 14 vines

The answer is 14."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices he wants (20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices) by the number of slices per pizza (8 slices per pizza). 

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we divide 25 by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make. 

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means Ram can make 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Now, we add the 25 original pens to the 5 new pens to find the total number of pens Ram has. 

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30

So, Ram has 30 pens in total."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply $30 by 3 to find the final amount: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to find the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A: 
   30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
   700 - 420 = 280 students.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 
John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies. 
John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

Now, we add the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will read: 4 (Dolly) + 2 (Pandora) = 6 books.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes per week. 

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 7 days in a week, and 24 hours in a day. So, there are 7 * 24 = 168 hours in a week.

Now, we can calculate the total minutes he spends writing per week: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes. 

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, he has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes. 

1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave the fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides: x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked:
6 hours per day * 4 days per week = 24 hours per week
24 hours per week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Since the makeup artist charges $250 per hour, the total amount before the discount is:
120 hours * $250 per hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, so we need to calculate 10% of $30,000:
10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, subtract the discount from the total amount:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up all the costs and divide by 3.

The total cost is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

Now, we divide the total cost by 3: $96 ÷ 3 = $32.

So, each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Then, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 
4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to multiply the number of cookies each of them ate by 200 calories. 
46 * 200 = 9200 calories
18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

The number of boys in the third class is 27."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 x 12 = 36 wolves.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to add the number of wolves and cougars he killed. 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to multiply his starting floor by 4 and then add 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down. 

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
4 times 21 is 4 * 21 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys and divides the new cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. 

So, the number of cows in each stall after the division is 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows per stall.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. 

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 22 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that termites ate. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books:
8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee:
$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52. 

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
36 + 30 = 66 cookies in total.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs:
66 / 12 = 5.5 cups

The final answer is 5.5."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300.

Two thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $0.62."

"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 

Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * 350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * 350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the selling price: 
Total amount paid = $400,000 + $12,000 + $20,000 = $432,000

Finally, let's subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: 
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $432,000 = -$32,000

Since Mr. Tan paid more than the selling price, he actually lost $32,000."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to get the total time. 

Total time = 28 minutes (heating up the oil) + 23 minutes (cooking the chicken) = 51 minutes.

The answer is 51."

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6 windows per house. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12 windows.

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8 windows.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. So, 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines Sean has to memorize: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

2. Then, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Next, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter B: 1/2 of 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. Then, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Now, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter C: 5/8 of 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. Finally, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

So, 9 cards had the letter D on them.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, we can represent their current ages as x and y. 

We can write an equation: x + y = 20

Since we want to find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to both of their current ages. 

So, in 10 years, their ages will be (x + 10) and (y + 10). 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

We already know that x + y = 20, so we can substitute this into the equation: 
x + y + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations: 
1. R = 6S
2. R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute R from the first equation into the second equation: 
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation: 
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides: 
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides: 
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3: 
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

The total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. So, the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800, and the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Since each team member brings 2 guests, the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

Adding the team members and coaches, the total number of people is 15 + 30 = 45. 

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy needs 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas. 

Since each pizza costs $15, Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches. So, the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead. 

17 inches / 0.25 inches per bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we need to add the number of stories each of them wrote. 

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories, 
Braylen wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories, 
and Margot wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to add the number of stories they wrote in the second week to the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8 rows. 

The answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry. 

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 6000 / 2000 = 3.

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have in total. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

Let's call the total number of medals given out 'x'. We can set up the equation: 39 = x/10.

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10 = 390.

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 24 + (8 * 5) = 24 + 40 = 64.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left after the adults have received their share. The adults got 24 chocolate bars, so 64 - 24 = 40 chocolate bars are left.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide 40 by 8, which is 40 / 8 = 5.

Therefore, each child will get 5 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Since all players have over 20 points, they will get an extra point each in the fourth round. 

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 + 1 = 19 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

To find the total points, we add the points of all three players:
22 + 19 + 43 = 84

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
The youngest son washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. 

Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 2 meals per day, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 / 14 = 3

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 

15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

Since he sold 20 crates over the weekend, we need to add those to the total as well. 

45 + 20 = 65 crates

Now, we need to subtract the total number of crates sold from his target of 120 crates to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250. 
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300. 
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $200, $250, and $300. 

The total amount she paid is $200 + $250 + $300 = $750.

The desk costs her $750."
"To find the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so the total distance driven in a day is 30 + 30 = 60 miles.

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven in a week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven in a year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the miles driven. He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of miles driven is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

Additionally, he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus he pays is 150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total amount John pays a year for driving is the sum of the cost of miles driven and the bonus, which is 30,000 + 1,800 = $31,800.

"To find out how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how much he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90 books.

The total number of books she has is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books she sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110 books.

Each book sells for 20 dollars, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight Joey loses per week.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight Joey loses (8 pounds) by the weight Sandy loses per week (2 pounds).

8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. 
Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is 120,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles. 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble. 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 x $.1
= $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we need to subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men. 

Number of men who left = 1/4 of 25 = 25 / 4 = 6.25 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 6 = 19

Now, we know that 19 men stayed and 22 men stayed. The difference between these two numbers is 22 - 19 = 3. This means 3 more men left than women. 

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 more men left than women, we can set up an equation to find the number of women who left. 

Let's say the number of women who left is x. Then, the number of men who left is x + 3. 

We know that the total number of people who left is 10, so we can set up the equation: 

x + (x + 3) = 10

Combine like terms: 
2x + 3 = 10

Subtract 3 from both sides: 
2x = 7

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 3.5 (round down to 3 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

So, 3 women left the party. 

Now, we know that 15 women were at the party initially and 3 women left. 

Number of women who stayed = 15 - 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26. To find 'x', we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. 

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to find 'x'. 

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, there are 8 pencils in each box. Now, we know that Jam has 3 * 8 = 24 pencils in the boxes and 2 loose pencils. 

Total pencils Jam has = 24 + 2 = 26

Now, we add Meg's pencils to Jam's pencils. 

Total pencils = 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed. 

Number of boxes = 72 / 8
Number of boxes = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used. 

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are used. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12 to find the total weakening effect of the ice cubes.

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the weakening effect of the cream. However, we can assume that the cream weakens the coffee equally to the added liquid. Since 15 milliliters of cream are added, the coffee becomes 15 milliliters weaker.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect.

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many old records the 5 people brought in. 

Since they leave with 7 new records, and they get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring in, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say the number of old records they brought in is x. 

Since they get 1 new record for every 2 old records, the number of new records they get is x/2. 

We know that the total number of new records they get is 7, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 7.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 7 * 2.

x = 14.

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

First, we need to find out how many people were on the bus after the second stop. We know that 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

Now, we need to subtract the people who were on the bus after the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. So, 21 - 20 = 1.

Therefore, 1 person got on the bus at the terminal.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we multiply the remaining percentage by 3 minutes. 

40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 minutes by 60 to convert it to hours.

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

The phone will take 2 hours to fully charge."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17, which is 17 - 3 = 14.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20. So, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were halved. 

The customer got 4 rewards, but the coupon took half of that, so they got 4 / 2 = 2 dollars off.

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent. 

$80 - $2 = $78

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total amount of taxes Nick will pay. 

First, we calculate the total amount of taxes for Job A: 
$15 * 2000 = $30,000
20% of $30,000 is 0.2 * $30,000 = $6,000
So, the net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the net pay for Job B. 
First, we need to find the net income after property tax: 
$42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Then, we calculate the taxes on the net income: 
10% of $36,000 is 0.1 * $36,000 = $3,600
So, the net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay: 
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate half of the number of ruined castles. 

First, we find the number of ruined castles by multiplying the total number of castles by the percentage of ruined castles:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. This means the new price is 150% of the original price, or 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth $12 each, so the total value is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price is 75% of the previous price, or 0.75 times the previous price. So, the new price is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth $9 each, so the total value is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we know John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of chickens and cows. 

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20.

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Total number of legs = (20 cows * 4 legs) + (40 chickens * 2 legs) = 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is 160."

So, Josh has 7 balls to juggle on stage."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the information given:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of the animals and the container:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

Earnings from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Earnings from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original earnings and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

- Medicine: $100 per month

Total weekly expenses: $25 (food) + $5 (treats) + $0 (medicine, since it's monthly) = $30 per week

Now, let's calculate the monthly expenses:
- Food: $25 per week * 4 weeks = $100 per month
- Treats: $5 per week * 4 weeks = $20 per month
- Medicine: $100 per month

Total monthly expenses: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Andrea saved $21."
"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on other activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since this is 30% of his total time, we can set up the equation: 15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since 50 is 100% of his total time, and he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 50 by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20.

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she earned from her jobs and add it to her initial savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

Now, we add her initial savings of $80 to the total amount she earned: $275 + $80 = $355.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after she spends on the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- Arcade tokens cost $5
- 2 go-kart rides cost 2 x $10 = $20

Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will get $5 for arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget:
$60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend ($5) to find out how many friends she can invite:
$55 ÷ $5 = 11

So, Morgan can invite 11 friends to her party.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops in 5 days: 1 dollar * 5 days = 5 dollars.

Her daily pocket money is 5 dollars, so the total amount she saves in 5 days is 5 dollars - 5 dollars = 0 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's divide the money Billy had initially ($8) by the cost of candy per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy he bought: 8 / 1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 100 + 75 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and the chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each part of the trip separately.

First, we need to find the time it took John to drive to his friend's house. Distance = 200 miles, Speed = 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours.

Next, we need to find the time it took John to drive back home. Distance = 240 miles, Speed = 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time it took John to drive to his friend's house and the time it took him to drive back home. Total time = 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours.

The total time John spent on his trip is 5.86 hours.

"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we find the total number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students: 
96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

Then, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys: 
53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49

So, there were 49 boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

49"
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2 since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To find the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we need to subtract the points she already has from the total required points.

She has 15 points from the first test and 18 points from the second test. 
15 + 18 = 33 points

She needs at least 42 points in total. 
42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

And the number of people kicked out for physical violence:

3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So, Sara had 4.67 points before. 

Now, we need to find out how many points Erin had before. Since Erin had 3x points before, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of $20. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4
   So, the total cost for picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add up the costs: $884 + $10 + $132 = $1026

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * 400 = $320

So, the cost of the materials is $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper. 

Total cost = $320 (materials) + $400 (original wallpaper) = $720

The final answer is: $720"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, so they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes they did on Saturday, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add the hours from each day. 

She had 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days is 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

The total hours Hallie had dance practice per week is 5 hours.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000.
40% of the equipment is faulty, so the number of faulty pieces is 40% of 400,000.
40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000.

Since 160,000 pieces are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is 240,000.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the total amount of milk from both halves.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, Mary collects 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pupils like yellow, we first need to find out how many pupils like blue and how many like green.

There are 40 pupils in total. Half of them like blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we know that 20 pupils like blue and 5 pupils like green. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils. So, 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we need to divide the total amount of money she got ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

There are 50 socks in total. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks. 

50 - 35 = 15

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she gave to her brother from the total number of cookies she had initially.

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel initially had and the number of cookies Janet gave her: 
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Then, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate: 
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she needs to pay over 5 months. 

First, we need to find the interest for one month. 
Interest for one month = Principal * Rate / 100

= $365

Since she has to pay for 5 months, we multiply the interest for one month by 5. 
Total interest = $365 * 5 
= $1825

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the total amount she needs to pay. 
Total amount = Principal + Total interest 
= $3650 + $1825 
= $5475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5. 
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5 
= $5475 / 5

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Since she spends $18 on supplies, her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade. 

She sells 4 cups per hour, so she sells lemonade for 4 hours. 

$18 / 4 hours = $4.50 per hour

The final answer is 4.50."
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to get x = 12.8 * (5/2)

x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he gets a discount for bundling, the total cost for both is $10 * 0.8 = $8 per month. 
So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 + $8 = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 
To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $18 = $42 per month.

So, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable package."
"To find the total work time, we need to add the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

First, we need to convert the time spent recording into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can add the time spent on each activity: 
4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

The final answer is 21.43."

Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.

Now, he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left. Since he only has 2,000 steps left after his jog, he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is 2,000."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means she pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound. 

Cost of the first pound: $3
Cost of the second pound: $3 * 0.5 = $1.5
Total cost of taffy: $3 + $1.5 = $4.5

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. 

Cost of seashells: $1.50
Cost of magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of seashells and magnets: $1.50 + $1 = $2.50

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets: 
$4.5 + $2.50 = $7

Sally started with $10. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:
$10 - $7 = $3

Sally has $3 left."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240. 

The cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies a night, for 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12).

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

Now, we need to find the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes. Since the problem doesn't provide the probability of a candle exploding, we can assume that the probability of a candle exploding is the same as the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog, which is 5%. 

So, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05.

Now, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the probability of a candle exploding.

2500 * 0.05 = 125

Therefore, 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

125"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is A.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

T + S + A + 2T + 3S = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. 

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps is 2c + d. We are given that the total number of bumps is 304. So, we can write the equation: 2c + d = 304.

We are also given that the total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and dromedary has one head, the total number of heads is c + d. So, we can write another equation: c + d = 180.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' and 'd' by solving these equations simultaneously.

First, let's solve the second equation for 'c': c = 180 - d.

Now, substitute this expression for 'c' into the first equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304.

Expand the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304.

Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304.

Subtract 360 from both sides: -d = -56.

Multiply both sides by -1: d = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers

Next, we need to find the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days:
Total distance = 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers = 1040 kilometers

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to this total.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
Distance = 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled in the second week to the total distance:
Total distance = 1040 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to get Zack's locker size. 

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is 40."

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Now, we subtract the cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Then, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the cats that ran away from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 18 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 * $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 * $12 = $96.
The last 18 months cost 18 * $14 = $252.

Now, we add the costs of all three parts: $48 + $96 + $252 = $396.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

First, we know that the total savings from both jeans is $6. We also know that Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. Let's call the original price of the jogger jeans 'x'. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, he saved (1/3)x dollars from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3x, must have come from the tattered jeans. We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, so 2/3x = 28. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us x = 28 * (3/2) = 42. 

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $42, we can find the difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. The difference is 42 - 28 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses can hold 30 employees each, so 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds."
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so we need to calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4. 25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1. So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first find out how much money he made from selling the cards. 

Since he spent $50 and had $50 left, that means he made $100. 

He sells the cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made ($100) by the price of each card ($1.5). 

$100 / $1.5 = 66.67

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 66 cards. 

Now, we know Kenny sold 66 cards. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, that means he sold 2/3 of the cards. 

Let's say the total number of cards he started with is x. 

2/3 of x = 66

To find x, we multiply both sides by 3/2. 

x = 66 * (3/2) 
x = 99

So, Kenny started with 99 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage, which is 44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is 132."

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

First, we know Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Then, Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
Three quarters of 100 is 75, so Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
Twice 75 is 150, so Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
One-fifth of 150 is 30, so Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon to get the total pints needed. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he spent $5 and had 1% left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

First, we need to find 99% of $5. 
99% of $5 = 0.99 * $5 = $4.95

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, we can find out how many bags he bought by dividing the money spent on chips by the cost of one bag.
Number of bags of chips = $4.95 / $0.40 = 12.375

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 12 bags of chips.

Now, we know George spent $4.95 on chips and $5 in total. So, the money left for candy bars is $5 - $4.95 = $0.05.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar.
Number of candy bars = $0.05 / $0.75 = 0.0667

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to 0 candy bars.

However, this doesn't make sense because George bought 3 bags of chips. Let's recheck our calculations.

We know George spent $4.95 on chips and had $0.05 left. This means he spent $0.05 on candy bars. 

Number of candy bars = $0.05 / $0.75 = 0.0667

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to 0 candy bars. But this is incorrect. We should round up to 1 candy bar.

So, George bought 1 candy bar.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared. 
25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops.

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. 
20 (shared lollipops) / 4 (number of friends) = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake.

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces. Since there are 8 pieces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces. The total weight of the pieces they ate is 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the pieces they ate from the total weight of the cake: 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, so the total number of people is 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Now, we divide 56 oranges by 8 people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. So, the cost of the onions is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. So, the cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can multiply the length by 3.

Length in feet = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 * 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling effect is 30 / 10 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase: 15 - 6 = 9 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We don't know James' run time yet.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say James' run time is x minutes. 
Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 
James' total time is 36 + 85 + x minutes. 
Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the equation: 
170 = 36 + 85 + x + 10
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
170 = 131 + x
Subtracting 131 from both sides, we get: 
39 = x

So, James' run time is 39 minutes.

The final answer is 39."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. 

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes. 

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

We also know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how many miles the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, and it runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance: 
32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:
16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is $30. 

The change he has after buying the hay is $30 - $24 = $6."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points Marcy scored from Joey's points.

Joey's points: 214
Marcy's points: 225
Marcy's score: 10

First, subtract Marcy's score from her points: 225 - 10 = 215
Now, subtract Marcy's score from Joey's points: 214 - 215 = -1

Joey is now 1 point behind Marcy.

The final answer is -1."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is 539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the colors from the six packets with eight colors each and the four packets with sixteen colors each.

First, let's calculate the colors from the six packets with eight colors each:
6 packets * 8 colors/packet = 48 colors

Next, let's calculate the colors from the four packets with sixteen colors each:
4 packets * 16 colors/packet = 64 colors

Now, we add the colors from both sets of packets:
48 colors + 64 colors = 112 colors

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of a regular movie ticket as x and the price of a regular popcorn as y.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $12 + $1 (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $16.

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $12 + y + $3 = $15 + y.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + y = $16 - $2
$15 + y = $14

Now, let's solve for y:

y = $14 - $15
y = -$1

However, the price of popcorn cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $15 + y is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If you bought the super ticket, you paid $16. If you bought the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately, you paid $12 + y + $3 = $15 + y. Since you saved $2, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together must be $16 - $2 = $14.

Now, let's set up the equation:

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. 

Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the cost of filling one balloon was $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase: $65 * 170 = $11,100.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Then, it drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much money all her jewels are worth, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the value of the sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the 2 rubies she got in the trade is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The value of the 5 sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together: $6400 + $2400 + $4000 = $12800.

The total value of all her jewels is $12800."

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed = total volume / volume per bag = 320 / 2 = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost = number of bags * cost per bag = 160 * 12 = $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9.

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound. So, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds. So, the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds. So, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds. So, the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the items together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity: 3400 / 2250 = 1.51.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants * 1.6
Toni's plants = 10 * 1.6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we subtract 7 from Toni's plants.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
20 apples * 45 cents = 900 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 900 cents = 9 dollars
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
20 apples * 50 cents = 1000 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 1000 cents = 10 dollars
Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
10 percent of 10 dollars is 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar
Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount. 
9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80:
15 items per room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

First, let's calculate the total number of shoes he gets:
5 pairs on Monday + 15 pairs on Wednesday + 30 pairs on Friday = 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 pairs

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2:
50 pairs * 2 = 100 shoes

Now, we add the shoes he already had to the shoes he got:
200 shoes + 100 shoes = 300 shoes

Finally, we subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday:
300 shoes - 180 shoes = 120 shoes

Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday."
"To find out how many cupcakes Mary needs to bake, we need to multiply the number of jars of sprinkles by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate. 

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans Mary should bake.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

The final answer is 4."
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 

Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, the cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3."
"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   1/5 of 30 pencils = (1/5) * 30 = 6 pencils.

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after two months:
   30 - 6 = 24 pencils.

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   1/3 of 24 pencils = (1/3) * 24 = 8 pencils.

So, there are 8 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, we multiply 2 by 6 to get 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we divide 12 by 12 to get 1 foot. Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply 1 foot by 2 to get 2 feet.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 2 feet long. To find the percentage, we divide 2 by 10 and multiply by 100. 

(2 / 10) * 100 = 20%

The combined length of the remoras is 20% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we need to know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

If 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk (7 days in a week). 

240 minutes / 7 days = 34.29 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.29 minutes each day for three weeks to break in the new shoes.

34.29"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide $300 by $15 to find the number of books she bought. 

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4.

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both (to avoid double counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group. 

Number of groups = 3
Number of employees in each group = 200

Total number of people = 3 * 200
Total number of people = 600

The total number of people going on the tour is 600."
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and they are going for 2 people, so the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The total cost of the trip is $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the money Keegan and Tashay have already earned. 

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. 
$83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200. To find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have from the goal. 

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Since Gabriel can add up to 100 songs and Luri can add up to 60 songs, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

100 - 60 = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add to his player.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up for each orange.

Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges. To find 2/5 of 60, we can multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10.

24 * 10 = 240

So, Stetson gave up a total of $240."
"To find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

He runs 12 miles a day and runs 5 days a week. 

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since he runs 10 miles per hour, we need to divide the total miles by the speed to find the total hours.

60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, one horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day. 

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to feed his horses. He needs to feed them for 5 days.

So, the total amount of oats needed for 5 days is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. 

One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = 6. 

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures:

-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily, so we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money to buy the toy car."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs he has.

Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray can hold 24 eggs. Since he has 2 trays, he can place 2 x 24 = 48 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the total cost of 2 packs is $4.00.

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor. 

$2.00 / 8 = $0.25

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

So, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, so she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The human pyramid is 48 feet tall."
"Charisma gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours a day, she gets up and walks 8 times a day. 

In 5 days, she will get up and walk 8 * 5 = 40 times.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Angela's current age is x.

Since in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we can write the equation as:

x + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

x = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find out how much Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the total cost of his morning rides and the total cost of his afternoon rides.

Morning rides: He drives twice a day for 14 days, so that's 2 * 14 = 28 rides. Each ride costs $6, so the total cost of morning rides is 28 * 6 = $168.

Afternoon rides: He also drives twice a day for 14 days, so that's 2 * 14 = 28 rides. Each ride costs $2, so the total cost of afternoon rides is 28 * 2 = $56.

Now, we add the total cost of morning rides and afternoon rides to find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many oranges they have in total, we need to add the number of oranges Ashley brought and the number of oranges Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the estimated cost of food. The cost of food at the first venue is $5 per guest. Let's call the number of guests 'x'. The total cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for 'x'. 

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides: 
$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:
x = 10

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects they found is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3x + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find out how many David found:

David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

First, we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator. Since 1/4 is the same as 2/8, and 1/2 is the same as 4/8, we can add them together.

2/8 + 4/8 = 6/8

Since there are 8 eighths in a whole, we can convert 6/8 to a whole by dividing 6 by 8, which is 0.75. 

So, they used 0.75 skeins of yarn altogether. 

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 0.75 by 364 to find the total yards used.

0.75 * 364 = 273 yards

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out how much money Suzie spent on the grape and green apple gum. 

She bought 2 packs of grape gum and 1 pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2 per pack, so 2 packs cost 2 x 2 = $4. The green apple gum cost half as much, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $4 + $1 = $5. 

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she spent on strawberry gum is $7 - $5 = $2. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood, he can get 200 sticks and it costs $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood, he can get 400 sticks and it costs $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 wood to get the most popsicle sticks for his money.

He can buy 2 x 8 wood with $24. 
2 x 8 wood costs $6 each, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

He can get 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

The final answer is 1600."

"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories in total.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 105,000 / 181 ≈ 578 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 578 calories to reach his goal."

8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Then, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Since she sold each bag for $8, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
$64 - $32 = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to multiply the number of punches he throws per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight.

First, we multiply the punches per minute by the number of minutes in a round: 
25 punches/minute * 3 minutes/round = 75 punches/round

Then, we multiply the punches per round by the total number of rounds: 
75 punches/round * 5 rounds = 375 punches

So, Joe threw 375 punches in the fight.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies by multiplying Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie's cookies = Josh's cookies * 2
Kelsie's cookies = 9 * 2
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 

The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how long it takes Royce, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert it to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and multiply the number of skeins required for each item.

There are 3 grandchildren, and each needs a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks. So, the total number of items is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:
- Hats: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins
- Scarves: 15 x 4 = 60 skeins
- Sweaters: 15 x 12 = 180 skeins
- Mittens: 15 x 1 = 15 skeins
- Socks: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins

Martha will need 255 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

There are 100 problems in total, so the number of problems remaining is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is 52 - 13 = 39.

Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts each person can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, then add the number of loaves returned.

First, let's subtract the number of loaves sold: 
200 (total loaves) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) = 68

Then, we add the number of loaves returned: 
68 + 6 = 74

So, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

6 + 3 = 9 rows of flowers in total.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her current and future weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week

Future weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week

Current weekly bill: 
84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

Future weekly bill: 
98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 2 days (since half a house takes 5 days). 

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so one person can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

If one person can paint a whole house in 48 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 48 / 5 = 9.6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs together: 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

The total amount Tom paid is $48. The cost of the CD is $4.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week and the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks - 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 60 * 20 = 1200.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 1200 + 4 * 60 = 1200 + 240 = 1440 shells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, to find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 

1440 / 10 = 144.

The final answer is: 144."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total vlogs she wants to make: 
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, you need to calculate the 20% tip.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, we can divide this amount by 2 to find the amount he saves in the first half of the month. 

$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half. So, we multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

$562.50 * 2 = $1125

However, this is the total amount he needs to save in the second half, not the daily amount. Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can divide the total amount by 15 to find the daily amount.

$1125 / 15 = $75

So, Elvis needs to save $75 per day in the second half of the month.

To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to know the age of his younger son. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12, James needs 12 candles for him. The younger son needs 8 candles. In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how much James spends, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 and multiply by 3. 

20 candles / 5 = 4 packs
4 packs * $3 = $12

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5. 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we need to add the pages she read in the first week and the second week. 70 + 100 = 170 pages.

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches. 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Shiloh's nephew's age today is x.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

So, Shiloh's nephew is 17 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals: 80 - 20 = 60. 

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals: 80 - 45 = 35.

So, the number of goals scored by each teenager is as follows:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. There are 4 days in this period, so he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. There are 3 days in this period, so he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his initial $70. 
$70 - $20 = $50
$50 - $6 = $44

Since he has $44 left, and each plastic action figure costs $2, we can divide $44 by $2 to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy.
$44 / $2 = 22

So, Peter will have 22 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures.
22 (plastic) + 4 (wooden) = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month. 

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
The second flower shop orders 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
The third flower shop orders 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Now, we add up the total number of roses the shops order in a month: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses the shops order: 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have left after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account in 2 years. 

Since she removes $100 every month, in 1 year (12 months), she will remove 12 * $100 = $1200. 

In 2 years, she will remove 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Initially, Katina had $3000. After removing $2400, she will have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.

The final answer is 600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = (Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves) + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Total cost = ($3.00 * 10) + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00

The net profit of the food truck is $10.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64 to get the total number of crayons.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then add the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: 10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7 = 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. This half value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The resulting value (2) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 2 * (20 - 12) = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

So, they have 7 cards together."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520. 

To do this, we multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 1 + 0.04): 
520 * 1.04 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies into minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value. 
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups, and she bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.
The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100 and it's 10% off, the discount is $10. So, the price of 1 box is $100 - $10 = $90.

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90 = $180.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we need to find out how many days 90 contacts will last for 2 boxes. Since 1 box lasts 45 days, 2 boxes will last 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes. Since 90 contacts come in 1 box, 2 boxes will have 90 * 2 = 180 pairs of contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs: $180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour, and she spends 2 hours doing it, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour, and she spends 1 hour running, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, she needs to drink 8 times 100 ml, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add them together and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
He increases it by 5 WPM, so his new speed is 47 + 5 = 52 WPM.
Then, he increases it by 5 WPM again, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.
To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight after 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

Initially, Alex invited 100 people. Each of them invited 2 friends, so the number of additional people invited is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of additional people invited from her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the initial number of people invited, the additional people invited from her friends, and the additional people invited from her friends' spouses. 

Total number of people = 100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex needs 318 seats."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, and the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. 
So, the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it's taller than Mark's window.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window (20 feet). So, it's not taller yet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it's taller than Mark's window.

So, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide 200 grams by 3 grams to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day.

200 grams / 3 grams = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week.

66.67 grams/day * 7 days = 466.69 grams of protein per week

The final answer is 467."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents. 
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents. 
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents. 
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Adding all the values together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5. 
345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses now, we need to calculate the weight he used after increasing it by 50%. 

First, we find 50% of 8 pounds: 
50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 pounds = 4 pounds

Then, we add this to the original weight:
8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

So, Steve has 34 games after 3 years.

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled (1200 miles) by the time it took (3 hours). 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Now, 3/4 of 60 pounds is 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds. 

So, Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour. 

In 12 hours, Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates. 

Ruiz makes 120 * 6 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours. 

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate how much he spent in total.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the money he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the money he spent: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned in the first four hours and the next two hours separately.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade. At $0.50 per cup, he earned 60 * 0.50 = $30.

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade. At $0.60 per cup, he earned 20 * 0.60 = $12.

To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to add the money he earned in the first four hours and the next two hours. So, $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12. 

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find out how much Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he's buying and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt is 30% off, so we multiply the price by 0.3 to find the discount amount.

Discount on shirt = $25 * 0.3 = $7.50

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt to get the sale price.

Sale price of shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the sale price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to get the total cost.

Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Let's assume a standard sales tax rate of 8% for this example.

Sales tax = $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost.

Total cost with tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Finally, we subtract the total cost with tax from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much he will have left.

Money left = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $6.70.

The final answer is: $-6.70"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we first need to calculate how many croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days. 

4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants: 
28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply 336 by 1/4. 

336 * 1/4 = 336 / 4 = 84

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter = $194
Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
= $194 * 490
= $95,060

To find the difference in cost, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Monica's street = $194 * 150
= $29,100

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

The difference in cost to repave Lewis' street is $65,960."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,500 = $2,380,000

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,000 = $2,880,000

The total cost of John's research is $2,880,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat each player ate:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat. 

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 loads of laundry per week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so he uses 2 * 20 = 40 gallons of water per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so Gary uses 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons of water per year.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so Gary spends 2080 * 0.15 = $312 on water for laundry in a year.

The 3 pieces of coral cost 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.
The 20 fish cost 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.
The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$10.00 + $5.00 = $15.00
$15.00 + $6.00 = $21.00
$21.00 + $10.00 = $31.00

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Now, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

Now, let's subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year.

Now, let's divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years.

So, it will take Adam approximately 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Now, we know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright on the wave.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
= 4/5 * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes he can afford to miss:

Total cost = $60
Maximum cost per class = $10

Number of classes he can afford to miss = Total cost / Maximum cost per class

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people he needs to buy cupcakes for. 

He needs to buy cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. 

So, the total number of people is: 
1 (himself) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since he wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70. 

Initial likes = Total likes / 70
Initial likes = 2000 / 70
Initial likes = 28.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 28.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes. 

Total likes = Initial likes + New likes
Total likes = 28 + 20000
Total likes = 20028

The final answer is 20028."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was 20 * 18 = $360.

The next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount, so the price per pomegranate was 30 * 0.9 = $27. The total cost was 20 * 27 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 360 = $180."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's say the sales of green hats in the first month is x. 
Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales of red hats is x/2. 
We know that the total sales of red hats is $400, so x/2 = 400. 
Solving for x, we get x = 800. 

So, the sales of green hats in the first month is $800. 
The total sales in the first month is 800 + 400 = $1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = $900. 
The total sales in two months is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that more money was in her bank account than her weekly wage. However, the question asks for the amount withheld from her wage. 

Let's try again:

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$420 - $300 = $120

So, $120 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

So, Mike will finish the book in 20 days.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 x $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 x $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 x $10,000 = $120,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: 330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, the cooking time for beans is 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs is 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations to find the value of 's'. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation: (4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of other items) = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class. 

He attends the class 4 times a week for 6 weeks. So, the total number of class hours is 4 * 6 = 24 hours.

Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, we divide the total class hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns. 

24 / 1.5 = 16

So, John learns 16 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we need to add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

If they share this money equally among themselves, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes.

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, we find 20% of the total employees: 
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Then, we find 30% of the result: 
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first find the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, let's look at the pattern of the first 30 days: 
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The remaining 10 days were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the updated pattern for the first 33 days is:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The next 10 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good.

To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days. 
The total number of good days is 12 (first 8 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 15.

The total number of days is 30 (first 30 days) + 3 (next 3 days) = 33.

So, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

15"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

The answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he had 1 toy per dog.

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the total number of dogs became 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.

Since 3 dogs were gone, James no longer needed those toys, so he only needed toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * 1200 = 480 dollars.

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount. Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. Frances' investment = 2/3 * 720 = 480 dollars.

4. To find out how much Skyler invested, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount. Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they have is 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 

100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns in one day. 

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes it takes to make 36 hash browns.

First, we find out how many groups of 6 potatoes are in 96 potatoes. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Since each group of 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns, we multiply 16 by 36.

16 × 36 = 576

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max. 

So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies: 
Katarina has 68 cookies, Max has 73 cookies, and Summer has 96 cookies. 
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 96 = 237 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, we subtract 20cm from the final length to get the length before the lace trim was added: 
140 - 20 = 120cm

Now, we know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. This means the 120cm is 150% of the original length (100% + 50% extension). To find the original length, we need to divide 120 by 1.5 (which is the same as 150% expressed as a decimal). 
120 / 1.5 = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. 

In ""rabbit"" mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in both modes: 0.5 hours + 20 minutes. To add these, we need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes. 0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes. 

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the age of the younger twin is 'x'. Since there's a twin who is 7 years older, the age of the older twin is 'x + 7'. 

There's also a set of triplets, so let's say the age of the youngest triplet is 'y'. Since there are three triplets, the ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of all four are 44. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms: 
2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x and y represent ages, they should be non-negative integers. 

One possible solution is x = 8 and y = 6. 

The age of the older twin is x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he spends on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert the time before dinner to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the time before dinner: 
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4).

$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost.

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 x 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. So, in 120 months, he will save 20 x 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 2/5 of 20 coins is (2/5) x 20 = 8 coins. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves in 120 months. 28 x 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we need to add the coins Rong and Neil have saved. 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines + heartworm check). 
Since we don't know the total bill yet, let's represent it as x. 
So, the heartworm check is 0.6 * (40 + 0.6x). 
Now, the total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = 40 + 0.6 * (40 + 0.6x). 
Simplifying the equation, we get x = 40 + 24 + 0.36x. 
Combine like terms: x = 64 + 0.36x. 
Subtract 0.36x from both sides: 0.64x = 64. 
Divide both sides by 0.64: x = 100. 
Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * 100 = $60. 
The total cost is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100. 
John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."

We also know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas. So, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color. 

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs needed.

40 + 8 = 48

Since there are 57 people attending (42 adults + 15 babies), and there are 48 chairs, Mia needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks by multiplying 50 by 0.5 (which is 50% expressed as a decimal).

Number of bucks = 50 * 0.5 = 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of bucks by 0.2 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

Number of 8-point bucks = 25 * 0.2 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students.

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. 
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of grandchildren and then multiply it by 3.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Then, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she put into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

720"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first find the total number of pencils in the box. 

Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Now, to find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2. 

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard. 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks bought.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 more friends they meet up with). 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 14 people, we can divide 14 by 5 (2+3) to find out how many sets of drinks and snacks are needed. 14 / 5 = 2.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of a set, we'll round up to 3 sets.

So, 3 sets of drinks and snacks are needed. Each set costs $2, so 3 sets will cost 3 x $2 = $6.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $6."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela and Gordy's trucks together can carry 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds of gravel. 

So, the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry is 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

2,800"
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he initially got. 

Since the total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5, and Gerald got 3 parts, we can divide 100 by 5 to find out how much money each part is worth. 

100 / 5 = 20

Gerald got 3 parts, so he initially had 3 x 20 = 60 dollars.

Gerald spent 10 dollars on a book, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5 since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount they've already raised from their goal. 

$6300 (goal) - $2100 (already raised) = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they've already worked.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 32% = 68%.

The final answer is 68."
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the total number of days by the daily charge: 14 * 12 = 168.

The final answer is 168."
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. 

The cost of 5 croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The cost of 3 mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00. 
10% of $50.00 is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The total bill is $45.00."
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she has $6.00, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

Since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops for free. So, she can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free. 

In total, she can get 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy she eats in two weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days. 

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, so after eating 42 pieces, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, so after eating 56 pieces, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left.

Amy has 58 pieces of candy left, and Ginger has 44 pieces of candy left. 

The difference between the amount of candy Amy has and the amount Ginger has is 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24. 

24 * 24 = 576 

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

Cost of picking blueberries: 
- Initial cost: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Total cost of blueberries: $20 + (30 pounds * $1.5/pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store: 
- Cost per pound: $2.5
- Total cost of blueberries: 30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Now, let's find out how much James saved:
- Savings: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10

The final answer is 10."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to find 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is 0.1 x $700 = $70.

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

$770 x 500 = $385,000.

The company paid $385,000 to buy the computers at the new prices."
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories, so the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet has 2 oz of cheese, and each oz of cheese is 120 calories, so the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet has an equal amount of ham, which is 2 oz, and each oz of ham is 40 calories, so the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham together: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The total calories in the omelet are 770.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are up, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Since she dances for 5 minutes, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

- When her arms are down, she dances for 3 minutes (5 - 2 = 3). So, the total number of taps is 3 * 550 = 1650.
- When her arms are up, she dances for 2 minutes. So, the total number of taps is 2 * 400 = 800.

The combined total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes the pothole himself. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:

$120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt) = $195

The potential damage to his car is $450. 

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:

$450 (potential damage) - $195 (total cost) = $255

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12. 4/3 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12. 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to find out how many slices were left. We subtract the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends (16 slices) and the slices eaten by the two remaining friends (18 slices) from the total number of slices (60). 60 - 16 - 18 = 26 slices.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12. 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe in inches.
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, so 50% of the votes is 2 * 20% = 40%. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so candidate B got 20% + 40% = 60% of the votes.

Now, we know that candidate A got 20% and candidate B got 60% of the votes. The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. 

100% - 20% - 60% = 20%. 

So, candidate C got 20% of the votes. 

To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to calculate 20% of 100 voters. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20.

"To find out how many apples Beck has now, we need to subtract 23 from 23 (the number of apples Beck had initially) and then add 10 (the number of apples Boris gave to Beck). 

23 - 23 = 0
0 + 10 = 10

So Beck now has 10 apples. 

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has. 

100 - 10 = 90

The answer is 90."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has.

10 + 6 = 16

So, Alice has 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98"
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we need to first find out how many like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to play either video games or music is 50 - 10 (bakers) - 5 (basketball players) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is 25."

"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40

Now that we know each class has 40 students, we can find the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, we multiply 40 by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now that we know there are 16 girls in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the total cost is:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

However, the question states that 12 groups are required. To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the required number of groups.

Number of groups needed = Total students / Required number of groups
Number of groups needed = 54 / 12
Number of groups needed = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Number of groups needed = 5

Therefore, 1 more group is needed to form the required 12 groups."
"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the number of items he initially sent and subtract the number of broken items.

Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, he sent 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.

He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When the items were returned, 10 glasses were broken, so we subtract 10 from the initial number of glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.

Similarly, 6 plates were broken, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Now, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the first trade and 60 small buttons from the second trade, so she has a total of 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons.

In total, she has 20 large buttons and 87 small buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against the new regulation 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of votes is 33. The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, so we can write the equation: 

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying it by 2: 
2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies. Let's say the total number of puppies is x. Then, 2/3 of x is equal to 18 (the number of Pomeranians). 

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate that as follows:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Now, we know that these 200 movies are cheaper, and we can buy them for $6 each. So, the cost of these movies is:

200 * 6 = $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we know that 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. We can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of these older movies is:

160 * 5 = $800

Now, we have the cost of the movies in series and the cost of the older movies. We also know that the cost of a normal movie is $10. So, the cost of the remaining movies (which are normal movies) is:

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
240 * 10 = $2400

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, so Ava jumps on 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Emma finishes the level in 60 - 4 = 56 seconds. Ava finishes the level in 56 + 4 = 60 seconds.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract 30 dollars from 64 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining amount by 2:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. 
3 * 5 = 15

On the extra days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. 
There are 2 extra days, so they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days. 
15 + 12 = 27

The total number of times they ride their bikes a week is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's say x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) white fish. We are told that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out of the tank. 

Now, we know that 4 orange fish were taken out, and 17 - 4 = 13 white fish were taken out. 

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 13 white fish, Bob had 4 - 13 = -9 white fish, but again, we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the 13 white fish taken out must be incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the equation.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

3 - x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 - x = -9 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

3 = -9 + 3x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, x = 4. This means that 4 orange fish were taken out of the tank. 

Now, we know that 4 orange fish were taken out, and 17 - 4 = 13 white fish were taken out. 

However, we know that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of white fish must be half the number of orange fish. 

Let's set up the equation:

Number of white fish = Number of orange fish / 2

We know that the number of white fish is 4 + 13 = 17. 

17 = (3 - x + 4) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

34 = 7 - x + 4

Combine like terms:

34 = 11 - x

Subtract 11 from both sides:

23 = -x

Divide both sides by -1:

x = -23

This is incorrect, so we need to re-evaluate the equation.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

Number of white fish = Number of orange fish / 2

Number"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. So, the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, he travels 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we divide the total distance by his fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we multiply the gallons by the price of gas to find the total cost:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

$15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by 0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = 35

Now, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 by 20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = 200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of 200, we multiply 200 by 3/5.

200 * 3/5 = 120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we add the amount from the quarters and the amount from the twenties.

35 + 120 = 155

Therefore, Carrie paid $155 for lunch.

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 (smart) + 5 (analog) = 15.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trip that John needs to cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school is covering half of it, so John needs to cover the other half, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

John already has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs: $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of seashells, we need to first find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups. 

90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know there are 10 groups. Since 3/5 of the groups have members bring back seashells, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought seashells.

10 * 3/5 = 6

Since each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The total number of seashells brought back is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people on the train, and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.

Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days:

Then, multiply the result by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 * .25 = 75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20, so for 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. So, for the additional 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

In total, Jamie was paid $160 + $90 = $250 for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 

12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions and lion cubs. 

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to first calculate the discount on the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. The discount is 25% of the original price. 

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10. 

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill.

$50 - $30 = $20.

Mike will have $20 left over."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then multiply it by the monthly salary.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

The monthly salary for each employee is $4000. So, the total amount paid to employees in one month is 220 * $4000 = $88,000.

To find the total amount paid in three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3: $88,000 * 3 = $264,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $264,000."
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so singing it twice will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so singing it once will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, we need to calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours. 
Billy's earnings = hourly wage * number of hours
Billy's earnings = $11.50 * 20
Billy's earnings = $230

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's earnings = hourly wage * number of hours
Sally's earnings = $10.50 * 20
Sally's earnings = $210

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings
Difference = $230 - $210
Difference = $20

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score to find the total. 
Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has. 

Three puppies + five koalas + two zebras + four frogs = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find 30% of 14. 

30% of 14 is 0.3 * 14 = 4.2. Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to 4.

So, Bubbles should buy 4 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she played 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours more to earn the achievement.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to find the distance between them. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car: 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and the gold separately, then add them together and add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can find the total number of students who passed by adding the number of students who passed in each grade: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with two bags of glass chips. 

Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. 

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height. 

12 / 3 = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. 
10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert 48 quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has in total. 

Dale started with 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

He sold 150 candies, so to find out how many he still needs to sell, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies he has. 

200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25. 

Divide the total amount of money Felix made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches he climbed.

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since Felix made this money in a week (7 days), we need to divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

So, there are 101 petals in the vase."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag. The bag had 35 marshmallows initially and 18 were used, so 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows are left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 17 marshmallows / 2 = 8.5 S'mores. Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John and DeSean can each have 8 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long each person played and then multiply that by the cost per game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes, his friends can play for 10 minutes, and the better friend can play for 30 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Let's divide the total minutes by the minutes each person can play to find out how many games each person played:

Jack: 240 / 20 = 12 games
Friend 1: 240 / 10 = 24 games
Better friend: 240 / 30 = 8 games

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Jack: 12 games * $0.25 = $3
Friend 1: 24 games * $0.25 = $6
Better friend: 8 games * $0.25 = $2

Total cost: $3 + $6 + $2 = $11

The total amount of money used is $11."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We also know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. Let's call the amount of citrus zest and fragrance y ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x (salt) + x (sugar) + 2x (oil) + y (citrus zest) + y (fragrance) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x + 2y = 10

We know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, so we can substitute x for y:

4x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5/3

Now that we know the amount of salt, we can find the amount of oil:

Oil = 2x
Oil = 2(5/3)
Oil = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide 10 by 3:

Oil ≈ 3.33

So, Tanya uses approximately 3.33 ounces of oil.

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total cupcakes needed:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% is the same as 0.2). 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students, we divide the amount from students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is equal to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she walked on the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day. Converting this to minutes, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, half of the cars had left. Half of 70 is 70 / 2 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 x $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, the total amount he earns per day is 30 x $6 = $180.

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find the weekly earnings: $180 x 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we know she scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins in each package.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will get.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since Milly has to pay the shipping cost, she will lose $3.00 (shipping cost) + $32 (original cost) - $24 (refund) = $11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Total amount spent = $60 + $20 = $80

Mulan started with $40 and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.

Since Mulan can't have a negative amount of money, this means she actually spent more than she had."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours in a month.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she does her makeup 6 * 4 = 24 times in a month. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, so she spends 0.25 * 24 = 6 hours in a month doing her makeup.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it would take for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 to find the time it takes for one turtle.

Time for one turtle = 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4.

Time for four turtles = 12 hours * 4 = 48 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know how much. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400. 

x + $150 + $80 = $400

Combine the constants: $230 + x = $400

Subtract $230 from both sides: x = $170

So, Erika has $170 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so he had 3 x 5 = 15 large apple slices. 

He also had 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 small apple slices. 

In total, Adam had 15 + 15 = 30 apple slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so he has 30 - 15 = 15 apple slices left.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow per day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow to find out the number of cows needed.

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs.

15 cows - 3 cows = 12 cows

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length: 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length: 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length: 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items he wants to buy = $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Now, let's subtract the total money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600.

5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills. 

Four $20 bills equal 4 * $20 = $80.

The hat costs $70, so we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid: $80 - $70 = $10.

Thea got $10 in change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40. So, he has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by multiplying 60 by 2. 
60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying 120 by 2.
120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks, we add 60 and 240 together.
60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract the total time taken by the intermission.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Now, we subtract the time taken by the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time of the concert (120 minutes). 
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the remaining time (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform.
110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest for the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest for the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest for the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

So, Brenda will have $1615.28 after 3 years.

1615.28"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white shirts have no collars and how many floral shirts have no buttons.

Half of the white shirts have collars, so the other half do not have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with no collars.

We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Farm X initially had 55 goats and 10 goats were sold. 
55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

Farm Y initially had 45 goats and twice as many goats were sold as in Farm X, so 2 * 10 = 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.
45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. 

Now, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs bought: $2640 / 24 = $110.

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food. 
3 baskets of green food cost 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food. 
3 baskets of red food cost 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the cost of the red food. 
$54 - $6 = $48.

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food. 
$75 + $48 = $123.

The total cost is $123."
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the total time it would take to clean all the rooms. 

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, the total time to clean all the rooms is 90 * 20 = 1800 minutes.

Since we want to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to divide the total time by 2. 

1800 / 2 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

900 / 60 = 15 hours.

The answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, so they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the second year, so they will build 2 * 36 = 72 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 72 = 120.

The town will have built 120 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am 3 years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Then my brother's age is 'x + 3', and my sister's age is 'x - 2'.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age can't be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for a numerical answer. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks he needs. Since he has 27 students and wants 2 glue sticks for each student, he needs 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs he needs. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks for all the students. This will give him 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 he needs."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

First, we know that the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day. So, on the second day, the amount of water passing through the river is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day and add it to the total number of infected people.

Day 1: 
- 10 people are initially infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2:
- 70 people are infected from Day 1.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3:
- 490 people are infected from Day 2.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20. 10% of $20 is 0.1 * $20 = $2. 

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800. 
Julieta received $800 - $2 = $798.

Now, we add the amount Julieta and Rafaela received. 
$798 + $800 = $1598.

The final answer is: 1598"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 x 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
So, the total number of oranges she gave away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to know how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. 

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. 

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Anne has as 'A', the number of books Sofie has as 'S', and the number of books Fawn has as 'F'.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: S = A + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: A = F - 12.

Now, we know that together they have 85 books, so we can write the equation: S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Substituting the second equation into the previous equation, we get: (F - 12 + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2F + 11 = 85.

Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get: 2F = 74.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: F = 37.

The final answer is 37."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10

Now, we know the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello boxes Greg needs, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs. Since each box makes 10 cups and he wants 4 cups per kid, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid.

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since each box makes 10 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per box to find out how many boxes he needs:

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost:

12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $400 by 4 to get the weekly cost. 

$400 / 4 = $100 per week

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to find out how much Keenan pays. 

40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

$40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we need to find 3/5 of the total pieces.

3/5 * 60 = (3 * 60) / 5 = 180 / 5 = 36

So, 36 pieces were left after the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's subtract those from the remaining pieces.

36 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.

26 - 14 = 12

So, Tobias ate 2 + 10 + 12 = 24 pieces in total.

4. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left."
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to calculate how much he will make from selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens. 

3/5 of 300 chickens is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens. 

Since he sells each chicken for $50, the total amount he will make from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

However, he wants to make a profit of $2000, so we need to subtract the cost from the total amount he will make. 

Let's say the cost of each chicken is x. Then, the total cost of 180 chickens is 180x. 

We know that the total amount he will make minus the total cost should be $2000. 

So, 9000 - 180x = 2000. 

Now, we can solve for x. 

9000 - 2000 = 180x 
7000 = 180x 
x = 7000 / 180 
x = 38.89

So, Isaias bought each chicken for approximately $38.89."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

So, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

Since her present age is 8, we subtract 8 from 24 to get 16. 

Therefore, it will take 16 years for her age to be thrice her present age.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chicken: 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, so 6 * 2 = 12. The cost of the chicken is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 * 4 = $12.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the apples: 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so 7 * 2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $20 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $56.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $56 = $9.

"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert. 

First, we subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, we need to find the runtime of her usual concerts. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we divide the result by 2:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys.
He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky.

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 
250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were able to fit in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones could fit. 

80% of 50 microphones is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the total number of microphones that fit by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

6 birds in the bushes * 2/3 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups with 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups.

6 (birds in bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in groups) = 34

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide 50 by 5. 

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to first find out the total number of petals of each type of flower.

The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals of orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals of daisies is 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of orchids from the total number of petals of daisies. 

40 (daisies) - 25 (orchids) = 15

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, so the number of indoor plants is 100 / 4 = 25.

The remaining plants are outdoor plants. Since there are 25 indoor plants, the number of remaining plants is 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so the number of outdoor plants is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Since there are 50 outdoor plants, the number of flowering plants is 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. 

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x meters per second. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x meters per second. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

So, we can set up the equation: 11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5: 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first find out the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we divide the cost of the carrots by 2. 

$2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first figure out how much she made from each lawn. 

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1. 

So, she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 3*6 + 5*6 = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54. 

Since she made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the information given in the question. 

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total earnings. He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total hours worked is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. He gets paid $25 per hour, so his total earnings are 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit. $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. 
We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 7 / 3. 
x = 2.33 (approximately). 

Since Joseph had 2.33 notebooks, Martha had 7 - 2.33 = 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5. 

1 + 1/5 = 6/5

So, Anis rowed 6/5 * 50 miles = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance.

Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 

Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 18 - 13 = 5.

The answer is 5."
"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first determine how many bowls of soup are left after everyone eats dinner.

There are 4 adult bowls and 2 child bowls, so there are 6 bowls in total. Calvin, his wife, and the two children will eat 3 bowls, leaving 3 bowls of soup.

Since there are 8 child bowls, and there are 3 bowls of soup left, each child can have 3 / 8 = 0.375 bowls of soup for lunch. Since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, each child can have 0 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
So, for 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 yards of material.

For large masks: 
She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
So, for 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks: 
5 yards (small) + 2.67 yards (large) = 7.67 yards of material.

The final answer is 7.67."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, so she has seen 9 movies * 3 times = 27 times in total. 

The total amount spent is $216. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so that's 10 hours/day.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours/day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour/day.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has, we subtract the time he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 (total red shoe boxes) is 3. 
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 6. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. 

Now, we subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write:

D = 60

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A - 8 + 8
60 = 2A

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

60 / 2 = 2A / 2
30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes in a day. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours a day, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a day.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

The total time John spends on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks. 

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. 

We also know that there were 20 red balloons. So, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon. To find out how many yellow balloons there were, we divide the total number of pieces thrown at yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs. 

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, that's 12 balloons. The cost of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * 0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the items they bought is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($6) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. $31 / 2 = $15.5.

The final answer is 15.5."

Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total cost of lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost of lollipops = 300 * 0.5
Total cost of lollipops = $150

Total profit = Total number of lollipops sold * Selling price per lollipop - Total cost of lollipops

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate how many slices each person eats per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Now, let's add the slices they eat per day: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Since the loaf has 24 slices, we can divide 24 by 6 to find out how many days it will last: 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to multiply the number of years she has been collecting shells by the number of shells she collects each year.

Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years (from 5 to 10 years old). She collects 1 shell per year. 

5 years * 1 shell/year = 5 shells

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 5 shells."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we divide 27 by 3 to get 9 cups per row. 

Now, we know that in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, the 9 cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. 

To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we divide 9 by 2. 

9 / 2 = 4.5

Since we can't have half a cup, we can assume that Lana has 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

So, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips to get 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first calculate how much water is in the tank initially. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank has 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining water in the tank, we subtract the amount emptied from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. 

In total, Colby spent $8 + $16 = $24 on popcorn and candy. 

He started with $150, so he has $150 - $24 = $126 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday. So, he can buy  $126 / $10 = 12.6 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 12 tickets on Friday.

Colby already saw 5 movies on a Friday, so he can see 12 - 5 = 7 more movies on Friday.

Colby can see 7 movies on Friday."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total number of Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 
Average number of Junebugs removed per day = 300 / 5 = 60

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys she already had: 48
Bouncy balls in the tube: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:
P + A + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:
A = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:
P = A + J

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute this expression for P into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + A + 10 = 100

Now we can substitute the second equation into this equation:
3J + (J + 10) + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the initial number of balloons each person had and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon. 

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. So, the total number of balloons each person now has is 2 (initial) + 3 (additional) = 5 balloons.

Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of balloons is 5 x 5 = 25.

The total number of balloons is 25."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already own 10 boxes. 
So, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 
60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so she spat a total of 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so she spat a total of 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance = 820 / 2
Average total distance = 410

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the total money made from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200. The total money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

The final answer is: 64800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, so he needs to add 70 pesos for each of those hours. 5 hours * 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. We also know that there are 15 goats and 12 sheep. 

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we add the total amount of hay for goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

Total hay = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay = 75 + 84
Total hay = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

Since each pen costs 25 dollars, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we need to multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in his words is 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in his words is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows. 

There are 8 children in each row and 7 rows. 

8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. 

There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the total number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get. 

900 - 58 = 842

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. So, the labor cost is 35 * 2.25 = $78.75.

The fixed charge is $40. The cost of parts is $60.

The total cost is the sum of the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost. Total cost = 40 + 78.75 + 60 = $178.75.

The final answer is 178.75."
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs and then subtract the amount he got back from selling 5 of them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs:
10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Since James got 40% off, we need to calculate the discount:
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he got:
5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

Now, subtract the amount he got back from the total cost:
$90 - $200 = -$110

James is out $110.

110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount she will get from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams, she has 6 and they cost $1.5 each, so she will get 6 * $1.5 = $9.

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and they cost $2 each, so she will get 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and they cost $1.25 each, so she will get 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

So, the total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

First, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class.
Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times: 
6 copies * $5 * 10% = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission: 
$3 + $12 = $15

"To find Leo's age, we need to know Marcus's age first. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo's age is 2 times Marcus's age. So, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, and Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored (x + 10) + 10 points, which is x + 20.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book has 3 pages."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked. 

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find out how many sets of 15 minutes he worked.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, we need to find out how long she was asleep from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 am - 2:15 am = 23 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total time she was asleep. 
23 minutes - 5 minutes = 18 minutes

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. 
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep (18 minutes) to her usual sleep time. 
480 minutes + 18 minutes = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to the number of cups. One dozen is 12, so two dozen is 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can find 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After giving Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34.

34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 200 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Now, we need to calculate the number of days in 2 weeks. 
1 week has 7 days, so 2 weeks have 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. 
200 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (newly admitted patients) = 900 beds.

Now, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.
1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know she sends 7 work emails a day. 

The remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, so we need to find two-thirds of 9. 

Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

This means 6 emails are to her family.

The other emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so we need to find one-third of 3.

One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to know Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can say that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total before finding the treasure. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day. 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. 

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is 4 * 29 = 116 holes. 

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day: 116 - 29 = 87 holes. 

The final answer is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, we can calculate Collins' share as follows:

Collins' share = Amora's share + 15
Collins' share = 70 + 15
Collins' share = 85

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the shares of all three people. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 85, we can calculate the total number of corn chips as follows:

Total corn chips = Amora's share + Lainey's share + Collins' share
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms again:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled south. Total distance south = 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

Since the bird flew north for 36 miles, we need to subtract that from the total distance traveled south to find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. Distance between homes = 410 - 36 = 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, Nani's sister is 6 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30.

The total age of the family members is 30."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

John paid a total of $2100 for the phones."

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the garden, which can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of slats = Perimeter * 2
Total number of slats = 50 * 2
Total number of slats = 100

The total number of wooden slats Robert will need is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, let's find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington gave to her mom and sister. She gave 2 boxes to each of them, so she gave 2 + 2 = 4 boxes in total. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

2. Now, let's find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left. She bought 12 boxes, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges initially. After giving away 80 oranges, she had 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

3. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

4. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left. So, 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of the number of states in the USA: 
50 / 2 = 25

Then, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India: 
25 + 4 = 29

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to find the total number of states: 
50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation: 
Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's cherries from the total number of cherries: 
Total cherries = 60
Richard's cherries = 20
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 
Robert's cherries = 30
Jerry's cherries = 40
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 40
Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the price of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Saturday: 
  Gingerbread = 10
  Apple pie = 10 - 4 = 6

- Sunday:
  Gingerbread = 10 + 5 = 15
  Apple pie = 15

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Saturday: 
  Gingerbread = 10 * $6 = $60
  Apple pie = 6 * $15 = $90
  Total = $60 + $90 = $150

- Sunday:
  Gingerbread = 15 * $6 = $90
  Apple pie = 15 * $15 = $225
  Total = $90 + $225 = $315

Now, let's add the total earnings for both days:
$150 + $315 = $465

The final answer is: $465"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. 
Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40.

The price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

The final answer is: $100, $60"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

From the first statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be twice Emil's age at that time. So, D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother's age will be half of his dad's age at that time. So, B = D / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24.

Now, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, his brother is currently 24 - 5 = 19 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is D + B = 48 + 19 = 67.

"To find out how many beads Adrianne had altogether, we need to add the beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, so he caught 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and divide by 2.

Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

The average size of the shoes is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert 1.5 feet to inches as well. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space needed for the gaps between the plants. Since there will be 17 plants, there will be 17 gaps between them. The total space needed for gaps is 17 * 18 = 306 inches.

Now, we subtract the space needed for gaps from the total length of the bed to find the total space available for plants. 1332 - 306 = 1026 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can fit 1026 / 12 = 85.5 plants in the bed. Since we can't have half a plant, we can fit 85 plants in the bed.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the plants. Each plant costs $6, so 85 plants will cost 85 * 6 = $510.

The final answer is 510."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 9. 
So Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 
There are 7 days in a week. 
9 pretzels a day * 7 days = 63 pretzels.

Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, they can plant 30 - 27 = 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she sets aside $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two steps: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp.

90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees an hour. So, it cooled the room an additional 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at 2 degrees an hour. So, the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room was initially cooled 6 degrees, then cooled an additional 12 degrees, and then warmed up 4 degrees. 

The net cooling effect is 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

The final answer is -10."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * 30 = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

Now, let's solve for x:

90 = x + 75
x = 90 - 75
x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

1. He writes a check every month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
2. He writes a check every month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
3. He writes a check twice per month to the church, so that's 24 checks per year.
4. He writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22, and then divided by 2, which is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out how much money Walter has collected so far. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute to make the total amount three times of $2000.

Three times of $2000 is $6000. Since Walter already has $2000, his lawyer needs to contribute $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

The final answer is 4000."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were there. 

750 / 15 = 50

So, there were 50 people in the church next door.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's say each kid gets x slices. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x slices.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 4x = 6.

Combine like terms: 6x = 6.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 1.

So each kid gets 1 slice, and each adult gets 2 slices.

Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices out of the total 6 slices. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100: (2/6) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake.

First, let's convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time: 
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 120 minutes to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake
Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, the total time needed to make the cake is 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
So, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The weekly cost of renting the studio is $75. The total weekly cost is $45 + $75 = $120.

The total monthly cost is $120 * 4 = $480.

The total monthly earnings of the dance studio is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost of renting the studio. However, since the question asks for the expected earnings, we should assume that the total monthly cost is the total monthly earnings. 

The total monthly earnings of the dance studio is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4 to get 16 chocolate bars per box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to get 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box. We subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box: 16 - 8 = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to multiply the number of female porcupines by 4 and then by 12 (the number of months in a year).

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born.

50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company wants to know how many gallons of water they need, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in 1 cubic foot. 

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10488 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed. 

10488 gallons * 5.9 = 61952 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61952 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6195.20

The final answer is: $6195.20"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to know the number of yellow sticks. We know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance he traveled is:
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the distance she traveled is:
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances they traveled:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."

"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is 6000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means it loses 5 * 9% = 45% of its capacity in 5 hours. So, the remaining charge after 5 hours is x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means it loses 3 * 7% = 21% of its capacity in 3 hours. So, the remaining charge after 3 hours is 0.55x - 0.21(0.55x) = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4445x.

We are given that the remaining charge after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4445x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4445:

x = 0.28 / 0.4445
x = 0.63

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 63%.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage: $2,000 / $25 = 80 hours.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work: 80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the fruits he already purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * $.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $.75 each = 4 * $.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * $.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 / 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. 
The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of the new price, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30.
The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of the new price, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615.
The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is 139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means she put 9 pictures in each album. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, she must have 3 * 9 = 27 selfies. 

Since 2 albums were portraits, she must have 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by 18 pages to find the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading.

60"
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

First, let's calculate the number of guests who checked in. 
15 guests opted for a late checkout, and twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. 
So, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

In the afternoon, 7 more people checked in. 
So, the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

Now, let's calculate the total number of guests who checked out. 
24 guests checked out in the morning and 15 checked out in the afternoon. 
So, the total number of guests who checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of guests who checked out from the number of guests who checked in to find the current number of guests. 
37 (checked in) - 39 (checked out) = -2. However, this is not possible as the number of guests cannot be negative. This means that the problem statement is incorrect or there is an error in the calculation.

However, if we consider the problem statement as correct, the hotel would have 0 guests now."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she can answer correctly.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries can answer 75% of the easy questions correctly, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

She can also answer half of the average and difficult questions correctly, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, in total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions correctly.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is x dollars. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x dollars.

We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'y' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2y small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(Price of a large stuffed animal) * (Number of large stuffed animals) + (Price of a small stuffed animal) * (Number of small stuffed animals) = Total earnings
3x * y + 4x * 2y = 120

Combine like terms:
3xy + 8xy = 120
11xy = 120

Now, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. So, we can substitute x = 4 into the equation:
11 * 4y = 120
44y = 120

Now, divide both sides by 44:
y = 120 / 44
y = 2.73 (round down to 2, since you can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal)

So, Teresa sold 2 large stuffed animals and 2 * 2 = 4 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Now, we multiply 11 sandwiches per day by 7 days in a week: 11 * 7 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the money she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs not found by the Smith twins is 100 - 60 = 40.

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 40 eggs.

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 12 pounds, so he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 pounds by 40 dwarves: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is 43200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich ($1.5) by the number of sandwiches in the third package (8) to find the total price: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old bedroom.

Tom bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old bedroom for $1000. So, he has $1000 left.

Now, he has to pay 10% of the original price of the bedroom set each month. 10% of $3000 is 0.1 x $3000 = $300.

Since he already paid $1000, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

So, Tom has to pay $300 per month for the bedroom set."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons.

2. Calculate the number of red balloons remaining: 
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released: 
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. Calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining: 
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added: 
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios.

Scenario 1: The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension. The probability of this happening is 100% - 40% = 60%. In this case, Marcus still has to turn in his homework.

Scenario 2: The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension. The probability of this happening is 40%. In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

Scenario 3: The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework. The probability of this happening is 50%. In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. We need to add the probabilities of the scenarios where he has to turn in his homework.

Probability of normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension: 60% * 100% = 60%
Probability of substitute teacher coming in and not collecting homework: 50% * 100% = 50%

Adding these probabilities together, we get: 60% + 50% = 110%

However, since the probabilities must add up to 100%, we can subtract the excess from 100% to get the correct answer.

110% - 10% = 100%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first find out how many tickets are left after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to find the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses.

Melissa's daily income is $15 per day. She spends $3 per day on parking. So, her daily income after expenses is $15 - $3 = $12 per day.

Since she spends 3 days, her total income after expenses is $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she works in 3 days. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her total income after expenses by the number of hours she works: $36 / 18 = $2 per hour.

The final answer is $2."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to make each move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack. 

First, we need to find the total number of apples in two boxes. 
Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples per box = 80 apples

Now, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.
Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money: $50 - $40 = $10.

She will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000 * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000 per year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of the fabric is length times width, so 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2. 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many letters were delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add up the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736.

The post office delivered 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the summer.

Xavier's new height is 4 feet + 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Adding 3 inches, Xavier's new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches, which equals 52 inches.

Now, we subtract Xavier's new height from Cole's new height to find the difference: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find out how much money each person took.

Let's say the first person took x dollars. 
The second person took x + 80 dollars.
The third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by 3: 9 hours * 3 = 27 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters: 27 hours / 4 painters = 6.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 6.75."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in each set. Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books. 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance remaining = 1955 - 325
Distance remaining = 1630 kilometers

The answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days. 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide 240 cups by 16 cups/gallon.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train. 
So, the total number of people on the train is now 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. 
So, the total number of people on the train is now 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train. 
So, the total number of people on the train is now 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles needed. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles needed, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 200 / 1 = 200 tiles.

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12 = $2400.

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is 2304."
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 + 1 = 3 loads.

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies they watch in a week and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a week, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation: 
Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can set up another equation:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by all three:
Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is 31."
"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, so we need to convert it to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour, so the total cost of the visit is 0.5 * $300 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the parking. The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the total cost of the parking is 2 * $6 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find out how many emails he receives that require a response. 

James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require a response, so we need to find 20% of 80.

20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16

This means 16 emails don't require a response. The rest of the emails require a response. 

80 - 16 = 64

So, James responds to 64 emails per day. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add them up: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. 

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. 
The football team ate 80% of 40 pizzas (twice 20). 
80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the pizzas eaten by both groups. 
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60. 
Now, subtract the pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered. 
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

There are 14 pizzas left."
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 26200 cents is 262 dollars.

The total cost of postage is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 4 pounds (2 pounds * 2) and get 2 pounds for free. 

The cost of 4 pounds of butter is 4 * $4 = $16. 

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21. The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests. So, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they had initially. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = 120 dollars.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * 60 = 15 dollars. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * 60 = 20 dollars.

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35 dollars.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had: 120 - 35 = 85 dollars.

The two of them have 85 dollars left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas per day, the remaining bananas for the third monkey per day is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles is 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses first. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen is 12, 15 roses is 1 and a half dozen. So, the cost of 15 roses is 1.5 * $15 = $22.50.

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $22.50 - $5 = $17.50.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $17.50 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 17 dollars is 17 * 4 = 68 quarters. For 50 cents, we need 2 quarters. So, 17.50 is 68 + 2 = 70 quarters.

Jenny will leave with 70 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

9 burger platters * $11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total sales from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul will wait. He arrives at the station at 10 minutes and boards the fourth train at 145 minutes. So, the time Paul waits is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected from the total number of toothpicks required. 200 - 120 = 80.

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to divide 80 by 10 to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks. 80 / 10 = 8.

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

The sale price is 75% of the original price. 
Let's call the original price 'x'. 
75% of x is 0.75x. 
Since the sale price is $2000, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 2000 
To find x, we divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 2000 / 0.75 
x = 2666.67 

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
He bought it for $2666.67, so 120% of that is 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200. 

The original price was $2666.67, and the friend bought it for $3200. 
The discount is 3200 - 2666.67 = 533.33. 
To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: 
(533.33 / 2666.67) * 100 = 20%"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, it creates 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 times the number created by one spring in 4 hours, which is 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is 195."
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, the total distance is twice the distance to the store. So, the total distance is 2 x 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total time it took him to reach the store:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost of 10 bananas is 10 x $0.80 = $8.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of 10 bunches is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying 10 bunches from the cost of buying 10 bananas individually: $8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00. Since the result is negative, it means Jenny actually spent more money by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

However, if we consider the question as asking for the amount of money she saved, we can say she saved $22.00.

The final answer is: $22."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence: 
100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is 8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. 300 * 0.15 = 45. So, 45 bikes were BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB. We already know that 150 were Trekking bikes and 45 were BMX bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. We can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike by its price and adding them together.

The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so the earnings from Trekking bikes is 150 * 450 = $67,500.

The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. So, the earnings from BMX bikes is 45 * 250 = $11,250.

The price of an MTB is $500. So, the earnings from MTB bikes is 105 * 500 = $52,500.

Now, we add the earnings from each type of bike to get the total earnings. $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is 131,250."
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to add the extra time. 
1/16 of the total minutes in a week is spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
There are 1680 minutes in a week (60 minutes * 28 days). 
1/16 * 1680 = 105 minutes

Now, we add the extra time to the total class time. 
200 minutes + 105 minutes = 305 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
305 minutes / 60 = 5.0833 hours

The final answer is 5.0833."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10). 

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. The velociraptors ate half of 'x', so they ate x/2 kilograms. 

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x - x/2 = 270

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 2: 2x - x = 540

This simplifies to x = 540

So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. 

Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 540

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 2: x = 1080

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144."
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 cans. Then, her brother took 1 shaken can, leaving 2 shaken cans. 

Ellen's friend can get sprayed from any of the remaining cans, which are 2 shaken cans and 9 unshaken cans. 

The total number of cans left is 2 (shaken) + 9 (unshaken) = 11 cans.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/11.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/11) * 100 = 18.18%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first calculate the total number of days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31. 

20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day. 

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day. 

25 * 6 = 150 

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
30 minutes + 2 x 15 minutes = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes per day.

Since there are 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
60 minutes * 5 = 300 minutes

Now, we convert the total minutes to hours:
300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sheila bought:
Frying pan: $16.00
Towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information step by step. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age. 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age = 2 * 4 = 8 years.

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. 
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age = 3 * 8 = 24 years.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary. 

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren wants to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

Total amount needed = $20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Lauren will live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year. 

So, the amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This means she is actually spending more than she saves. However, we will proceed with the calculation as if she saves the full $20,000 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $400,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year.

Number of years = Total amount needed / Amount saved per year
= $400,000 / $20,000
= 20 years.

Since Lauren already has 20 years of savings, she doesn't need to work any more years to reach her goal.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by 4, then divide the result by 5.

First, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, that means 60% of the students are girls. 

We know that 40% of x is equal to 240 boys. We can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 60% of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 600 by 0.6:

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of heels.

The total height of the heels is 3 x 4 inches (for the 4-inch heels) + 3 x 2 inches (for the 2-inch heels) = 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are a total of 6 heels (3 of each height).

Now, we divide the total height by the total number of heels: 18 inches / 6 heels = 3 inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we need to first calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily miles: 310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day.

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 / 4 = 3 kg. 
1/3 of 12 kg is 12 / 3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre gets 3 kg and Paul gets 4 kg. 

To find out how much is left for Jacques, we need to subtract the total amount given to Pierre and Paul from the total amount of apples. 
12 kg - 3 kg - 4 kg = 5 kg.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 

Since the order is for 400 toys and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys in 10 hours. 
The remaining 200 toys will be produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours. 

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the remaining 200 toys by 10 hours: 200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply the total ounces by 30.

30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 900 M&M's. 

Each small bag has 10 M&M's. 

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide 20,000 kilometers by 400 kilometers (the distance Alfie flies per day) to find out how many days it will take.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the way around the earth.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number y. We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can set up the equation:

y + y + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms:

2y + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2y = 26

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 13

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, and Nik has 200 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 by 16 to get the weight in pounds: 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. Since the boxes also weigh 8 ounces each, and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Converting this to pounds, we get 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find out how much Valerie's brother earns. 

Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, and she earns half of what her brother earns, her brother earns twice as much as Valerie. 

So, her brother earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, we need to add Valerie's and her brother's salary first. 

$5000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we multiply this combined salary by 2 to find out how much their mother earns. 

$15,000 x 2 = $30,000

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together. 

$5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add that to the time it takes her to walk on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 40 minutes on the beach, we can divide 40 minutes by 2 miles to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. 

40 minutes / 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile

Now, we know it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 20 minutes * 2 = 40 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we add the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk and the time it takes her to walk on the beach. 

40 minutes (sidewalk) + 40 minutes (beach) = 80 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take. 
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding that Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. 

Initially, he has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, he can drink the water. This means the total amount of water he has now is 5 ounces. 

Since he can drink the water, the temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the unknown mug has x ounces of water. After pouring 1 ounce from it, the amount of water left in the unknown mug is x - 1 ounces. 

The total amount of water Donny has now is 5 ounces, so the amount of water in the 33-degree mug after pouring is 4 ounces. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 

4 + (x - 1) = 5 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x = 2 

This means the unknown mug had 2 ounces of water initially. 

Since the total amount of water Donny has now is 5 ounces, and he poured 1 ounce from the unknown mug, the temperature of the unknown mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

However, we can't determine the exact temperature of the unknown mug, but we can say that it must be at least 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in three weeks there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. So, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks, there are 21 days, so the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell paid. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is $4."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 6 potatoes make. Since 3 less than 6 is 3, we can say that 3 potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide 18 scoops by 1 scoop. 

18 / 1 = 18

So, Gomer ate 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs. 

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 17 - 34 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the ratio of men to women is 5:9. We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus:

(9/14) = x/84

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially.

Now, 20 women alight from the bus, so the number of women who remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total amount he earns from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. 

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Total cost = 100 / 5
Total cost = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find out how many rocks he sells.

Number of rocks sold = Total number of rocks * 0.6
Number of rocks sold = 20 * 0.6
Number of rocks sold = 12 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earns from selling the rocks.

Total earnings = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
Total earnings = 12 * 7
Total earnings = 84

Now, we can find out how much money he loses.

Money lost = Total cost - Total earnings
Money lost = 100 - 84
Money lost = 16

The final answer is 16."

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The maximum number of days is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a single unit. Since one dozen is 12, three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 

27 - 5 = 22

This means Carlos collected 22 seashells. 

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide 22 by 2.

22 / 2 = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 weekend days, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

Now, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

The first song is 5 minutes, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes. 

Now, we add the length of both songs together: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from Monday is $40 - $40 = $0.

Next, let's calculate the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from Tuesday is $40 - $80 = -$40.

Now, let's add the profits from Monday and Tuesday. $0 + (-$40) = -$40.

The total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is -$40."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to find Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = -1740 bottles

However, since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can do this by subtracting the current production from the total demand:

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

Let's assume y is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

y = 2300 * 0.2

y = 460

Now, we can find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand:

y - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the maximum number of bottles Hortex can produce to meet the total demand. We can do this by dividing the total demand by the current production:

460 / 4200 = 0.109 (approximately)

Now, we can multiply the result by the current production to find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand:

0.109 * 4200 = 462

So, Hortex needs to produce approximately 462 bottles more to meet the total demand.

The final answer is: 462"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of purple babies wearing a bow.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplet). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the total number of babies, which is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

Probability = (2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 75.2%

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from selling his land.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

Abraham initially sold 40 square meters for $50 and 10 square meters for $30. So, he earned 50 + 30 = $80 from the first two sales.

He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $90. So, his total earnings will be 80 + 90 = $170.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to first calculate how many eggs each person found.

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, we subtract the eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Now, let's find 60% of 400 apartments. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments.

So, the last complex has 240 + 400 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know the total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week, so he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so he makes 3120 * 0.40 = $1248 per week.

Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y, the blue rope is B, and the red rope is R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: R = 4(Y - 7).

We know that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write another equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R into this equation, we get: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 28 = 37.

Add 28 to both sides: 6Y = 65.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 10.83 (approximately).

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 10.83 - 7 = 3.83.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(3.83) = 15.32.

The length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she gave 15 / 2 = $7.5 to her sister.

Now, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. To find out how much she has left, we need to multiply 15 by 4/5. 

15 * 4/5 = 12

So, Rissa is left with $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money, but the problem doesn't mention anything about Ronnie giving any money to her sister. Therefore, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given initially.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. 

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'. 

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can write an equation to represent this:

x + x + x + x = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, the amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3 pints each.

Since the amount of yellow paint is also 'x', it's also 3 pints.

The question asks for the amount of red paint used, which is 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

First, we find the area of one bedroom: 
Area = length * width
Area = 20 * 12
Area = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240
Total area of bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
Area of living room = 5 * 240
Area of living room = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
Total area = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it contains. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.2). 

Number of pods in the new box = 100 * 1.2 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with 120 pods for $1. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box.

The cost of the new box is the same as the regular box, which is $12. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we can divide the total number of cycles by the cost of the new box.

Number of cycles for $1 = 120 / 12 = 10 cycles.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. This means he used 2.25 inches out of the original 5 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Since the teacher has 2.25 inches left, we can set up the equation: 1 * x = 2.25

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 1: x = 2.25 / 1 = 2.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. The teacher will have 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 1/3 * 12 = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24. 
The number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first calculate how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we need to multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3 and then add 2. 

3 * 5 = 15
15 + 2 = 17

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund will be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is 5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

Now, let's consider the second statement. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into this equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27,000) by the number of schools (3) and then divide the result by the cost of one book ($500).

First, we divide $27,000 by 3:
$27,000 / 3 = $9,000

Then, we divide $9,000 by $500:
$9,000 / $500 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. He put 1 in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, now he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.

Then, he picked up these 5 apples, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw the remaining 1 at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. So, now he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.

Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples and went home. So, he brought home 1 (in his pocket) + 6 (on the ground) = 7 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find out how many bags he ordered.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends ate.

For the cheese pizza, each friend ate 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend ate 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24 slices.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas."
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay can build in a certain amount of time, considering the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate how many snowballs he can build in 60 minutes:

20 snowballs/hour * 1 hour = 20 snowballs

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 60 minutes:

60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 intervals

Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, 4 intervals will result in 4 * 2 = 8 snowballs melting.

Now, we subtract the melted snowballs from the total:

20 snowballs - 8 snowballs = 12 snowballs

So, Jay will have 12 snowballs after 60 minutes.

It will take Jay 60 minutes to have 12 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from John's age. 

We know John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out. 

Let's say Jim's age at that time was x. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at that time was 2x.

We also know that the time difference between now and when Digimon came out is the same as the time difference between John's age at that time and his current age. 

So, 28 - x = 2x

Now, let's solve for x. 

28 = 3x
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to 9. 

So, Jim was 9 years old when Digimon came out. 

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the years that have passed since then. 

Jim's current age = 9 + 20
Jim's current age = 29"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6

So, they ate 6 slices of apple in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total earnings for the month of April.

First, we need to calculate her total hours worked in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week and the number of weeks.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked in April = 7.5 * 6 * 4
Total hours worked in April = 180 hours

Next, we need to calculate her total earnings for the hours worked. Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Total earnings for hours worked = Total hours worked in April * Hourly rate
Total earnings for hours worked = 180 hours * $1.5
Total earnings for hours worked = $270

Since Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, we add this amount to her total earnings for the hours worked.

Total earnings for April = Total earnings for hours worked + Additional attendance pay
Total earnings for April = $270 + $10
Total earnings for April = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and then add them together.

For doing his laundry, he earned $3.00.

For taking the trash out, he earned $1.50 per time. Since he took the trash out twice, he earned 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

For cleaning his room, he earned $1.50.

Now, let's add up the total amount he earned: $3.00 + $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 = $10.50.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. 

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. Since the scotch costs $600 for 10 bottles, the cost of one scotch bottle is $600 / 10 = $60. 
The cost of one cognac bottle is $60 + 50% of $60, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 
2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen needs to pay back is the initial amount plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in those months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he needs to pay back. 
$306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to know the total number of diapers. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, that means she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

So, Jordan changes the other half of the diapers, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is the area of the base times the height. The area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans. 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans. 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to subtract the true number from the estimated number. 202.5 - 900 = -697.5.

The final answer is: -697.5"
"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop. 

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, we need to find the number of people who entered at the second station. We know that 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first stop entered at the second station. 

Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30
So, 30 people entered at the second station.

Now, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. So, the number of people on the bus after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the total number of people on the bus after the third stop from the capacity of the bus.

Remaining spaces = 200 - 180 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is 5 * $2 = $10.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. So, the total cost for 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years: $10 + $15 = $25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, the number of groups that can be formed is 10 / 8 = 1.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 1 group of 8 students and 2 groups of 1 student each.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 1 group of 8 students is 45 minutes. The total time required for 2 groups of 1 student each is 2 * 45 minutes = 90 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required for everyone to try the escape room is 45 minutes + 90 minutes = 135 minutes.

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the items.

The cost of 4 wooden tables is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5. 

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x. 

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, so we can write the equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combine like terms: 5x = 40.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to first find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning he needs.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday. 

Rain on Monday = 2 inches
Twice the amount of rain on Monday = 2 * 2 = 4 inches

It's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total, so we add 1 inch to the result.

Total rain on Tuesday = 4 + 1 = 5 inches

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how many brownies and cupcakes Carly made. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is 'x'. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The salon offers a 20% discount for getting both. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 

$75 * 0.20 = $15

The total cost with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for each of the 10 fingers (5 fingers for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. 
Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has K + 8 paintings. 
Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (K + 8) - 12 paintings. 
We know that Samantha has 27 paintings, so (K + 8) - 12 = 27.

Now, let's solve for K:
K + 8 - 12 = 27
K - 4 = 27
K = 27 + 4
K = 31

Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, we calculate the price in December after the 80% increase:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Then, we calculate the price in January after the 50% decrease:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

For the standard lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so he earns:
4 * $80 = $320

For the lessons with veterans, Charlie charges 25% less, which is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons, so he earns:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores:

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate that as follows:

Original amount of pomelos = 20
Amount left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since she had 5 pomelos left, she must have given away the rest. 

Amount given away = Original amount - Amount left
Amount given away = 20 - 5
Amount given away = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.

Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. The number of apples he sold is 27.

The amount of money Walter received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is 81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters is the same as 3/4.

9 * 4 = 36

Regina has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he is traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total hours traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother. So, the initial number of grapes is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he uses one box per week. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00. 
So, the total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is 520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since a middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. 

To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase has 45 books. 
110 books / 45 books per bookcase = 2.44 (round up to the nearest whole number since you can't have a fraction of a bookcase)

So, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Since Rose will sell each egg for $1, we multiply the total number of eggs by the selling price per egg:

60 * $1 = $60

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price to find the profit:

$60 - $12 = $48

The final answer is 48."
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate 1/2 of 100, which is 50.

2. Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats. 100 - 50 = 50.

3. Next, we find 3/5 of the remaining hats that are blue. We calculate 3/5 of 50, which is (3/5) * 50 = 30.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats. 50 - 30 = 20.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions in both tests. 
The total questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the questions she got right on the first test from the total questions she needs to get right to pass. 
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this as an equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is 96."

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the steps:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He found one more marble, but it was a bead, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles and the other half have 5 medium candles. Since there are 4 rooms in each half, there are 2 rooms with 4 small candles and 2 rooms with 5 medium candles.

For the 2 rooms with 4 small candles, the total number of candles is 2 * 4 = 8 candles. 
For the 2 rooms with 5 medium candles, the total number of candles is 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 8 (small candles) + 10 (medium candles) = 18 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights: 18 (candles) + 4 (flashlights) = 22.

The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 22."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply 2 by 55. 

2 * 55 = 110

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete all six sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to complete the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call, which is 15 minutes. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works for 5 days, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5.

24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish from the time it takes for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 
4 * 0.5 = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 
8 * 1 = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. 
20 - 12 = 8 plants

Since these 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we multiply 8 by 0.25:
8 * 0.25 = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Phineas needs to cover. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Since half of the distance is on land, Phineas will hop 100 yards on land. He will swim the other 100 yards in the water.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in the water. 

Time = Distance / Speed

For hopping on land: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For swimming in water: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two times are independent, we add them together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

The total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes.

"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicles. 

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost him. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since there are 30 days in June, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of doughnuts per day.

10 dozen doughnuts = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day

Since there are 30 days in June, Derrick sells:
120 doughnuts per day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:
3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can use the formula: time = total words / speed.

time = 4500 / 375
time = 12 hours

The time it would take John to speak 10 pages is 12 hours."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (4 days), the total number of people on those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the people from all the days: 
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon and he wants to make 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can divide the total cups of lemon juice needed by the cups of juice per lemon to find the total number of lemons required. 

5 cups / 1 cup per lemon = 5 lemons

However, his friend wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. So, for the extra gallon, he will need 2 cups of lemon juice. 

Now, we need to add the lemon juice required for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon. 

5 cups + 2 cups = 7 cups

Now, we divide the total cups of lemon juice needed by the cups of juice per lemon to find the total number of lemons required. 

7 cups / 1 cup per lemon = 7 lemons

So, Tim will need 7 lemons in total."
"To find the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first find the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks is 32 - (4 + 8) = 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. 
There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies. 
There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43 pink candies.

"To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights. 

Cost of one night at the hotel = $80
Number of nights = 3
Total cost of hotel = 80 * 3 = $240

Now, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. Since it's 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, we can calculate it as follows:
Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80 = 0.1 * 80 = $8

Now, we need to find the total cost of the bus trips. 
Number of bus trips = 7
Total cost of bus trips = 8 * 7 = $56

Now, we can find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels by adding the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips.
Total cost = Total cost of hotel + Total cost of bus trips
Total cost = $240 + $56
Total cost = $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4.

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16. 
Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 
The price of the first T-shirt is $8. 
The price of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. 
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, let's add the new cookies to the remaining cookies:
11 + 12 = 23

Randy now has 23 cookies."
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount he would get from selling the two halves of his collection.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toys for $5 each and 6 toys for $7 each.

For the 6 toys sold for $5 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the 6 toys sold for $7 each, Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes Nate's dog dug while Nate was on vacation. 

Since Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day and he was on vacation for 14 days, the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day: 84 / 3 = 28.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to convert 28 days into weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We know that the total number of items on the lab bench is 29. Since Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance, which is 2 miles. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate Vanessa's time by dividing Aaron's time by 2.

Vanessa's time = Aaron's time / 2
Vanessa's time = 16 / 2
Vanessa's time = 8 minutes

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock and add the line he already has.

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

He already has 6 feet of line. So, the total line he needs is 600 + 6 = 606 feet.

The caretaker needs 606 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. 
So, the total cost per reservation is 2 x $5 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the daily revenue is 6 x $15 = $90.

Now, let's multiply the daily revenue by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week):
$90 x 2 = $180.

The answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find 25% of the total cost and add it to the total cost.

25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $20.

Now, we add the profit to the total cost: $80 + $20 = $100.

Since there are 50 watermelons, we divide the total selling price by 50 to find the selling price of each watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2.

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person peels in an hour. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Since they start at the same time, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the installation. Mark hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of the installation is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the installation to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs for each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can set up the equation: 
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation: 
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends).

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
