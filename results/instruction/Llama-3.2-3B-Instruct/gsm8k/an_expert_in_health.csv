"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs per week.

James runs 60 meters per sprint. He runs 3 sprints per week. 

Total meters per week = 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The final answer is: 180"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to her chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to her chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups.

To find out how much feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given so far from the total amount needed for the entire flock.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given so far
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
Feed needed for the final meal = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. 

Since Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (loss in the first year)

However, we are interested in when the tree starts generating a positive net profit.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

To isolate x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry option ($250) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can simply add the distances covered by both trains, which is 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we can add the distances covered by both trains, which is 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, to find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered in both parts. Since both trains are traveling in the same direction (westward), we can add the distances covered westward, which is 160 miles. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is 160 miles (westward) + 300 miles (northward) = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 336 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 336 / 12 = 28.

Therefore, Claire will eat 28 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Required Speed = Total Distance / Remaining Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, we can set up an equation to find the amount of the orange drink in the mixture: 

Let x be the amount of the orange drink in the mixture. Then, (2/3)x + 9 = 24. Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Now, we can find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 18 liters of orange drink + 9 liters of pineapple drink = 27 liters of liquid. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 24 - 27 = -3 liters. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the amount of water in the mixture. We know that the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 18 liters of orange drink and 9 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the mixture is 46/3 liters. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, we can set up an equation to find the amount of the orange drink in the mixture: 

Let x be the amount of the orange drink in the mixture. Then, (2/3)x + 9 = 24. Solving for x, we get x = 18.

Now, we can find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 46/3 liters of water in the mixture + 9 liters of pineapple drink = 24 liters of mixture. Since the amount of water in the mixture is 46/3 liters, we can set up an equation to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 

Let y be the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Then, y + 9 = 24 - 18 = 6. Solving for y, we get y = 6 - 9 = -3 liters. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our steps.

"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's current age:

Raymond's current age - son's age = 25 - 23 = 2 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when he was born.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the first stop. 

The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. Since the first stop was 20 miles from the beginning, we can subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip (45 miles) from the distance from the beginning to the first stop (20 miles).

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 - 45 = -25 miles. However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

The first stop was 20 miles from the beginning, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end, so the distance from the first stop to the second stop is 20 - 15 = 5 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 5 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - $5 = $99. 

Solving for B, we get B = $99 + $5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

Number of gold coins = x + 30
= 40 + 30
= 70

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   - First, we find half of Raymond's jewels: 40 / 2 = 20
   - Then, we add 5 to this result: 20 + 5 = 25
   - So, Aaron has 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - We subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels: 25 - 2 = 23

Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5
Total points scored = 9 points"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, this means he must have had $35 - $5 = $30 before buying the video games.

Now, we know that he had $30 and he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide $30 by $15, which is 30 / 15 = 2.

However, this is not the correct answer because he had 13 Lego sets initially. The correct answer is that he still has 13 - 8 = 5 Lego sets left."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

- Day 1: 60 miles
- Day 2: 60 / 2 = 30 miles
- Day 3: 30 miles
Total distance run per week: 60 + 30 + 30 = 120 miles

Time spent running per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total time spent running per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's average running speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 20 miles per hour

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

In 6 hours, she will spend 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 12 = 24 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. We know she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is the sum of the ones she had initially and the ones she used at work: 80 (initial) + 220 (at work) = 300.

Since she had 23 remaining, the total number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is the difference between the total used and the ones remaining: 300 (total used) - 23 (remaining) = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40.
= $40 + 0.5 * $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs sold per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens sold:
1764 eggs / 12 = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen to find the total weekly earnings:
147 dozen * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
Total revenue for Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$480 - $520 = -$40

The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. The total number of kittens is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide his available budget by that amount.

The total cost of a movie outing is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of popcorn, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we can divide Peter's available budget by the total cost of a movie outing: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, her annual pension increases by 5% each year. 

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $57,863.75
Year 24: $57,863.75 * 1.05 = $60,750.9375
Year 25: $60,750.9375 * 1.05 = $64,000.984375
Year 26: $64,000.984375 * 1.05 = $67,340.328125
Year 27: $67,340.328125 * 1.05 = $70,857.3453125
Year 28: $70,857.3453125 * 1.05 = $74,493.858359375
Year 29: $74,493.858359375 * 1.05 = $78,261.19140625
Year 30: $78,261.19140625 * 1.05 = $82,136.20078125

The total pension after 30 years is the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years.

Total pension = $50,000 * 20 + $82,136.20078125
Total pension = $1,000,000 + $82,136.20078125
Total pension = $1,082,136.20078125

The annual pension after 30 years is approximately $1,082,136.20."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract that from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find the miles per gallon (mpg), we can divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the amount of gas left in the tank to find out how far she can drive on a single tank:

8 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. Since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 1 hour reading each time. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. With 4 schools, the total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for the first month will be 2% of $150, which is $3. 

The total amount to be paid for the first month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

For the second month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3. The total amount to be paid for the second month is $150 + $3 = $153.

For the third month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3. The total amount to be paid for the third month is $150 + $3 = $153.

So, Shiela will pay $153 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in the remaining 185 days of the year.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 cups/bag to find the number of bags needed:

910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, Cecilia will need 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does. 

Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls got. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got to the total amount the girls got:

8 + 6 = 14 liters

So, there were 14 liters of water left.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract 9 from 54: 54 - 9 = 45.

Then, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract 28 from 45: 45 - 28 = 17.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 shirts/year = 44 shirts.

Therefore, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them together.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600

Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

The final answer is: $1169.23"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed can be represented as x + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can calculate his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 110% of his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 9.22 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes. 

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the equation would be: 32 = x / 2.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes (64 ounces) by 16 ounces per can to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

She currently has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she currently has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and add them together.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water per meal, which is 3 meals per day. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water per meal, which is 2 meals per day. So, he drinks 2 glasses of water per day on weekends. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because we know Frankie watched some TV on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent watching TV on these days is 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

This means that the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 0 hours, but that's not possible. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. This adds up to 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The final answer is 12.8."
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can write another equation:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons per part

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by the value of one part (6 teaspoons) to find the total amount of sugar used.

7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons

The final answer is 42."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps Jennie put on from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps Jennie put on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

The total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has.

Lily has 50 friends.
Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

The total number of friends they have together is 50 + 70 = 120.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges $150 per hour, so the hospital's revenue per day is:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from patients per day is:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

The total revenue from both the hospital and the patients is:
$30,000 (hospital) + $100,000 (patients) = $130,000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost (which is the hospital's revenue):
Profit = $130,000 - $30,000 = $100,000

The hospital makes $100,000 in profit from these visits.

"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 
So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. 
So, 10 more elves quit, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes for Tom in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Number of car washes per month: 4
Number of months in a year: 12
Cost of each car wash: $15

Total cost per year = 4 * 12 * 15
Total cost per year = 720

Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

For the second test, we do the same: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

The total number of questions completed is 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, the total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to the result. 

48 + 22 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to get:
2B + B + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
3B + Q = 700

Now, substitute B = 2Q into the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
Expand and simplify:
6Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food cost: $2 + $3 = $5

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax amount to the total non-food cost:
Total non-food cost with tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the total food cost and the total non-food cost with tax to get the total cost:
Total cost = $5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide that by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests per year

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Now, all the bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive. So, 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet.
Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to reach home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home. 

Waiting time = Time taken by loser - Time taken by winner
Waiting time = 40 - 36
Waiting time = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since we can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate all the fries, and there are no fries left.
6. However, the problem states that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that before the ants took the last fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
7. Since the pigeons ate all the fries after the seagull, and before the ants took the last fry, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries, which is a total of 7 + 9 = 16 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. The total distance Blake runs is 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, the total distance Kelly runs in one round is 100 + 80 = 180 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is 34 * 180 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest. 

The difference in distance between the winner and the loser is 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial count: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the count: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Cost after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Cost after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Cost after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Cost after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Cost after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Cost after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Cost after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also know there are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. If she loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she loses $35/hour, her lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income:

$105 (lost income) - $90 (cost of hiring the accountant) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1423

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1423
Money left for clothing = €77

The final answer is 77."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 eggs / 9 eggs
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the total miles he walks on the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."

"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes: 95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation to find the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. The equation would be:

$10 (revenue per gallon) * number of gallons = $25 (profit) + C (total cost)

However, we don't know the number of gallons yet. We know that for each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons as G. Then, the total cost is $5 * G. We can now rewrite the equation:

$10 * G = $25 + $5 * G

Subtracting $5 * G from both sides gives us:

$5 * G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5 gives us:

G = $25 / $5
G = 5 gallons

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost:

Total cost = $5 * G
Total cost = $5 * 5
Total cost = $25

Since the total cost includes both the cost of lemons and sugar, we need to subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons. The cost of sugar is $2 * 5 = $10. 

Cost of lemons = Total cost - Cost of sugar
Cost of lemons = $25 - $10
Cost of lemons = $15

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.
4. The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.
5. The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.
7. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these is 200 + 700 = 900$.
9. The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since we don't have any information about other items, we can assume that the total number of items ordered is the sum of these three. 

So, the total number of items ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x.

However, we are not given the total number of items ordered, but we know that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the total number of items ordered is at least the number of missing red roses. 

Since we don't know the exact number of white carnations, we can't determine the exact number of red roses. However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of the number of white carnations. 

Let's assume that the number of white carnations is 'x'. Then, the number of red roses is 4x. 

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we can say that the number of red roses to be delivered is at least 4x.

However, we still can't determine the exact number of red roses without knowing the value of 'x'."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

Now that we know Mark's current age, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation: J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 legs, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, their times are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0 * 100) = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used for the rabbits from the total straw used. 

Total straw used among small rodents = Total straw used - Straw used for rabbits
Total straw used among small rodents = 160 - 20
Total straw used among small rodents = 140

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. The total number of rats is 3x. 

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used among the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total straw used among the small rodents is 140, so we can set up the equation:

18x = 140

To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 140 / 18
x = 7.78 (round down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a rat)

So, there are 7 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Since the cost per bag for transportation is $2, we can find the number of bags transported:
Number of bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags transported = $140 / $2
Number of bags transported = 70

However, this is the number of bags transported, not the total number of bags. Since the trader bought some bags and sold 13, the number of bags bought is:
Number of bags bought = Number of bags sold + Number of bags transported
Number of bags bought = 13 + 70
Number of bags bought = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To determine the amount of insects needed per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days. 

Weekly amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects needed per day = Weekly amount of insects needed / Number of days in a week
Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has, which is $20. 

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots to be distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are $104,500.

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and then add the pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she initially had is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the pens she initially had to the pens she bought: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after six tests. 

The total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores and the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 358 - 71 = 129.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 3 plates. 

So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 240 cups by 240.

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 = $70.

The final answer is 70."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn more from babysitting than from lawn mowing, we can conclude that she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the required amount."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). 

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. However, we are looking for the number of customers on the third day, which is x + 50. 

x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

Therefore, Sloane counted 183 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told this is equal to y, so we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses, so the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the tank now contains 90 liters of water.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and then add it to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (46 / 96) * 100 ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 48%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add the base cost of the burrito to the additional items and the upgrade.

Base cost of the burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of additional items: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Upgrade cost: $3.00
Total cost of the meal: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"To determine the time it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of completing the puzzle.

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can complete half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest is 30% of 120, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36.

This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. The remaining melons are 84, so 3/4 of 84 is 0.75 * 84 = 63.

This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest after the two weeks.

The final answer is: 21"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 
   12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

2. Tax on the cars:
   10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

3. Registration fees for the cars:
   12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add up the costs:
$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden:

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices needed by 8: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

In addition to the 25 new pens, Ram already has the 25 pens he bought initially. So, the total number of pens he has is:

25 (initial pens) + 25 (new pens) = 50 pens

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Robert = 54
Robert = 54 / 2
Robert = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James = Robert + 6
James = 27 + 6
James = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
Difference = John - James
Difference = 54 - 33

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He receives 2 letters per week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

The total number of letters he writes per week is 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used so far. 

He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. 

Total minutes used so far = 450 (for his boss) + 300 (for other people) = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes he has left.

Minutes left = 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. 

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 50%. We can calculate the total number of boys as follows:
Total number of boys = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, the total number of boys in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 boys

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys:
Boys in the third class = Total boys - Boys in the first two classes

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate. 

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% expressed as a decimal). 

Weight of eaten wood = 400 pounds * 0.3 = 120 pounds

Now, we need to find the weight of the remaining wood. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, the remaining wood is 70% of the total weight. 

Weight of remaining wood = 400 pounds * 0.7 = 280 pounds

The total weight of the redwood is the sum of the weight of the eaten wood and the weight of the remaining wood.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per 2 cups of flour = 3 times the amount of flour needed for 12 cookies
3 * 2 cups = 6 cups of flour

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Using the same calculation:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per 2 cups of flour = 2.5 times the amount of flour needed for 12 cookies

Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan amount) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in each house. 

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of bedroom windows in each house is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Additionally, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of windows in each house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

Therefore, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is 180."
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories. 
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks. 
Alani's total stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total stories: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360."

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
It has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 5-star rows. Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 + 5x. 

Since the total number of stars on a 76-star flag is 76, we can set up the equation: 
24 + 12 + 5x = 76 
36 + 5x = 76 
5x = 40 
x = 8 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T / 11

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T / 11

Combine like terms:

39 = 10T / 11

Multiply both sides by 11 to isolate T:

39 * 11 = 10T

429 = 10T

Divide both sides by 10:

T = 429 / 10

T = 42.9

Since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the total number of medals given out, which should be a whole number. Therefore, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

The total number of medals given out for counting is 43.

The final answer is 43."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = 16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars

"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she earns: 150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15. 

So, Susan earns $15 for the online task."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is 83."

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount Carmen paid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total increase in the price due to their bids is 3 * $50 = $150.

Carmen initially bid $200. After the 3 other people bid, the price increased by $150. So, the price after the 3 other bids is $200 + $150 = $350.

Carmen then bids after each of the 3 other people, meaning she bids 4 times. Since the price increases by $50 each time, the total increase in price due to her bids is 4 * $50 = $200.

Adding this to the price after the 3 other bids, the final price is $350 + $200 = $550.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $550.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
The total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper.

In this scenario, each piece of paper is folded in half, creating two pages.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss.

Weekly weight loss for Joey = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight lost by Sandy's weekly weight loss.

Number of weeks for Sandy = Total weight lost / Sandy's weekly weight loss
Number of weeks for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = 4 weeks

Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4."
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can see a pattern. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The person will grow 8 new limbs after 15 days."
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $4000 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eating three eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eating two eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was:

Population six years ago = 3000N
= 3000(26)
= 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can set up the equation:

Population six years ago = (1/2)Population now
78000 = (1/2)P

To find the population of Chile now, we can multiply both sides by 2:

P = 2(78000)
P = 156000

The population of Chile now is 156000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = V * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since we know the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation 3x = 45. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 15. 

So, the number of electric poles required is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we need to add the pencils in the boxes to the loose pencils. Since we don't know the number of pencils in each box, let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26. Solving for 'x', we get x = 8. 

Now, Jam has 3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 26 pencils. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is 26 + 46 = 72. 

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box. 72 / 8 = 9 boxes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the weakening effect of the cream. However, we can assume that the weakening effect of the cream is the same as the weakening effect of the ice cubes, which is 12 milliliters per milliliter. 

Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, the weakening effect of the cream is 15 * 12 = 180 milliliters.

However, we need to consider that the coffee is already weakened by the ice cubes, so we need to subtract the weakening effect of the ice cubes from the total weakening effect of the cream. The total weakening effect of the coffee is 60 + 180 = 240 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 240 milliliters weaker.

240"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Let's assume the 5 people brought x old records. Since the ratio is 2:1, the number of new records they would get is x/2.

We are given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought 14 old records into the record store."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $184000."
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 - 7 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

The customer spent $80 initially. They used their rewards for $1 off for every $20 spent, which is $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. So, they got $4 off.

However, the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off, which is $4 * 2 = $8. 

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

Therefore, the customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The job with the higher net pay rate is Job B, with a net pay of $32,400. To find the difference, subtract the net pay of Job A from Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which is the number of ruined castles, and then divide that by 2, since half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of 88 is 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)

The total number of legs of the animals is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we need to calculate how many balls he added to his act over the four weeks. 

Initially, Josh started with 3 balls. Each week, he added 1 ball to his act. 

So, after the first week, he had 3 + 1 = 4 balls.
After the second week, he had 4 + 1 = 5 balls.
After the third week, he had 5 + 1 = 6 balls.
After the fourth week, he had 6 + 1 = 7 balls.

However, Josh dropped 3 balls during the performance, and 2 of them were caught. This means he lost 1 ball. 

So, Josh started with 7 balls and lost 1, resulting in 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, the number of plant pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

$195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. 
The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of all the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so now Dean has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 

$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. 

Let's assume the cost per person is x. The total number of friends Morgan can invite is $60 / x.

However, we can make an assumption that the cost per person is the cost of one round of mini-golf, which is $5. 

Number of friends = $60 / $5 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, the amount she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

5.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance between services: 900 / 18,000 = 0.05 days.

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24: 0.05 * 24 = 1.2 hours.

So, the train goes between services approximately 1.2 hours."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Then, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for each part of the trip:
Total time = Time to friend's house + Time to friend's house + Time back home
Total time = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 hours

The total time taken for the trip is 9 hours."
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

87"
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, to find the total number of kids, we add the number of boys and girls together.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50.

Combine like terms: 13x - 20 = 50.

Add 20 to both sides: 13x = 70.

Divide both sides by 13: x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person).

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5), the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10), and the number of people kicked out for physical violence (3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30).

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence: 50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14. 

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into several components:

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   The total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. 
   11 seniors * $12 per cord = $132

Now, we add up the costs: $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the labor. However, the problem does not mention the labor cost. Assuming the labor cost is negligible or already included in the original cost, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials.

Total cost = $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Now, let's add the hours together: 
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Given that 40% of the equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000, the number of functioning pieces is:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is the cost of the total number of functioning pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece
= 240,000 * (400,000 / 400,000)
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount. 

First, we need to calculate the total interest for 5 months. 

Total interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Total interest = $3650 * 10% * 5 months
Total interest = $3650 * 0.1 * 5
Total interest = $1825

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3650 + $1825
Total amount = $5475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by 5.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $5475 / 5
Monthly payment = $1095

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1095."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To determine the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. She spent $18 on supplies.

To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will need 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

Now, we can calculate the profit per hour by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue and dividing by the total number of hours. 

Profit per hour = (Total revenue - Total cost) / Total hours
Profit per hour = ($36 - $18) / 9
Profit per hour = $18 / 9
Profit per hour = $2

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each of these services will be 80% of $10, which is $8 per month. 
So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 (cable) - $26 (streaming) = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Recording time: half of 240 minutes = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to this gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards given away: -29
Cards received: +17

Total cards now: 50 - 29 + 17 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny then eats 2 slices, leaving her with 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount he has in his bank account and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially and needs $300 for the bike. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more than $300.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save more money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, if Mark saves his earnings every day, it would take him 30 days to save $300."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference in age between Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total calories = Number of glasses * Ounces per glass * Calories per ounce
Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3
Total calories = 48

John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's yearly earnings, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and gets paid $50 per day. So, his weekly earnings are 6 * $50 = $300.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his yearly earnings would be 52 * $300 = $15,600.

The final answer is: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The new total energy usage in 30 days: 
2700 watts/day * 30 days = 81,000 watts

Now, we calculate the energy saved: 
216,000 watts - 81,000 watts = 135,000 watts

Converting the energy saved to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. 
There's one zebra with 36 stripes. 
The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the first two, so it has 17 / 2 = 8.5 stripes.

Now, we add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 8.5 = 78.5.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 78.5 / 3 = 26.17.

The average number of stripes is 26.17."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of each needed for 20 people as follows:

- Meat: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
  Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, we need 5 pounds of meat.
- Cheese: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
  Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

$50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

We also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
5% of 50,000 candles = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Now, we need to find 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog, which will explode:
1% of 2,500 candles = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

We know that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now, we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute C into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between 6,000 feet and Oliver's current elevation of 3,000 feet. 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: $4000 (twice as much as the first bank)
Total amount received from both banks: $4000 + $4000 = $8000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $8000 (total amount received) = $13000

So, Mr. Josue now has $13000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

There were 12 cats left on the rock."

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The final 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and 2/3 of the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

The total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x - (x + 6)) + (2/3)((x + 6) - x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3)(-6) + (2/3)(6) = 6

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 3x + 30 + 3x
= 6x + 30

However, we still need to find the value of x. Since the problem doesn't provide any additional information, we can assume that the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is a positive integer. Let's try x = 10.

If x = 10, then the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x = 30, and the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) = 3(20) = 60.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 30 = 90.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 90 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to use the rest of the money to buy a ticket to the amusement park. Since the ticket costs $100, he must have $50 left over after buying the ticket. This means he must have had $100 initially.

We also know that he sells the cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of them. Let's denote the total number of cards he starts with as 'x'. The amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $1.5x.

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The amount of money he gets from selling 2/3 of the cards is $1.5 * (2/3)x = $1x.

We know that the total amount of money he has initially is $100, so we can set up the equation:

$1x = $100 - $50
$1x = $50

Now, we can solve for x:

x = $50 / $1
x = 50

So, Kenny starts with 50 cards. 

50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests would not get a second hotdog. To find out how many, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 
The total number of letters is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how many gallons she needed. Since she needed 1/4 of a container, and there are 15 gallons in total, we can calculate the amount of gasoline she needed as follows:

15 gallons * 1/4 = 15 * 0.25 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the amount of gasoline she needed to pints:

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means that 380 cents is 99% of the money he had initially. To find the total amount of money he had initially, we can set up the equation:

99% of x = 380

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.99x = 380

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.99 to find x:

x = 380 / 0.99
x = 383.38

Since George started with $5, we can round down to the nearest dollar, as we can't have a fraction of a dollar. So, he initially had $5.

Now, we can find out how much money he spent on candy bars. We know that he spent $5 in total and had $0.38 left, so he spent:

$5 - $0.38 = $4.62

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars he bought:

$4.62 / 0.75 = 6.16

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 6 candy bars would cost 6 * 0.75 = $4.50, which is less than $4.62. Therefore, George must have bought 7 candy bars.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. 

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends: 

20 (shared lollipops) / 4 (number of friends) = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the pieces taken
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it's on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the total amount of money:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6"

Let's denote the regular price of a popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. So, the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $20 - $3 = $17.

We are also given that buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price saves $2. This means that the cost of the popcorn and the soda together is $12 + $2 = $14.

Since we know the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $17, and the total cost of the popcorn and soda together is $14, we can set up the equation:

17 = P + S

We also know that the soda costs $3, so we can substitute S = $3 into the equation:

17 = P + 3

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 17 - 3
P = 14

So, the regular price of a popcorn is $14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 45. This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11,050.

The final answer is 11050."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. 
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) = 350 cards.

Since she gives 10 cards to each student, we can divide the total number of cards by 10 to find out how many students she has: 350 / 10 = 35.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 35 students.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9.

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                    = 1/3 * 240

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The total length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we can multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

First, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Now, we can divide the total time in hours by the number of days:

4 hours / 4 days = 1 hour per day

So, Jason needs to walk for 1 hour each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks."
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book to find the total number of books:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child received:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting the kids who are allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

Number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

Daily consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds
Daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
Total oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag:

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will pay for only 1 pack. 

The total cost of 2 packs would be 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. However, since she's buying 2 packs but only pays for 1, the total cost will be $4.00 (for the pack she pays for) + $2.00 (coupon) = $6.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the total number of razors she buys is 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $6.00 / 8 = $0.75 per razor.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can set up the equation: 
Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * Brett's age in 4 years
18 = 3 * 14
18 = 42

However, this equation is incorrect because it assumes Angela's age in 4 years is 18, which is actually Brett's age in 4 years. We need to find Angela's current age.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Angela will be three times as old as Brett in 4 years, we can set up the equation:
Angela's current age + 4 = 3 * (Brett's current age + 4)
Let's denote Angela's current age as A. Then the equation becomes:
A + 4 = 3 * (14 + 4)
A + 4 = 3 * 18
A + 4 = 54
A = 50

So, Angela is currently 50 years old.

"To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To determine the cost of each venue, we need to consider the fixed cost and the variable cost.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The total cost of the first venue is the fixed cost of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. So, the total cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x.

The total cost of the second venue is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost of the second venue is $25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for x.

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:
$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:
x = 10

Therefore, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. 

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + 7 + B/2 = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards. 
Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Total yards used = 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and then add them together.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 * 5 = 10.

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 3 * 2 = 6.

Adding these together, we get 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid a total of $7, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible. 

Since he has $24 and each 2 x 8 costs $6, he can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood for $24. This will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

He can then use the remaining $0 to buy 2 x 4 pieces of wood, but since he has no money left, he cannot buy any 2 x 4 pieces.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed.

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs
24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes

Now, we can multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost.

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To calculate the weekly cost of bus trips without a pass, we need to multiply the cost of a single trip by the number of trips per week. 

Cost per trip = $2.20
Trips per week = 5
Weekly cost without pass = Cost per trip * Trips per week
Weekly cost without pass = $2.20 * 5
Weekly cost without pass = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost with the pass:
Weekly cost with pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the weekly cost with the pass from the weekly cost without the pass:
Savings = Weekly cost without pass - Weekly cost with pass
Savings = $11.00 - $20
Savings = -$9.00

Since savings can't be negative, it means that buying a weekly bus pass would actually cost Janet $9 more than not buying one."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of items Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of days: 
August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October (31 days) + November (30 days) + December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 or 29 days, depending on the year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 308 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, the total calories he needs to burn is:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:
105,000 calories / 308 days ≈ 340 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 340 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. In a week, he would earn 30 * 7 = $210.

However, he spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot, which is x + 3x = 4x. 

Given that the total cost is $120,000, we can set up the equation 4x = 120,000. Solving for x, we get x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000. 

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is 90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$64 - $32 = $32

The profit Tara earned on her bags is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total fight time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has initially, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total amount of money Ali has initially is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80.
The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the time Royce takes, we need to first find the time Rob takes in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60. 

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we multiply Rob's time by 2 and add 40 minutes.

2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

- 1 sweater: 12 skeins
- 1 pair of mittens: 1 pair = 2 skeins
- 1 pair of socks: 2 skeins

Since there are 3 triplets, the total number of items is 3 x 5 = 15 items.

Now, we multiply the total number of items by the number of skeins required for each item:
- Hats: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins
- Scarves: 15 x 4 = 60 skeins
- Sweaters: 15 x 12 = 180 skeins
- Mittens: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins

Martha will need 300 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

So far, Chris has completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, Chris completed 13 problems on Wednesday.

Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3 * 22 = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to get the number of CDs:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all items is $2,400. To find the cost of the monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 300 / 10 = 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down Elvis's monthly savings target into two halves. 

Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month would be 15 days (1-15), and the second half would be 15 days (16-30).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as 'x'. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half would be 2x.

The total savings for the month would be the sum of the savings in the first and second halves, which should equal his monthly target of $1125.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms: 3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3: x = 375

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 375 = $750 in the second half.

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we divide the amount he needs to save in the second half ($750) by the number of days in the second half (15): $750 / 15 = $50.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first. 

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps and calculate the number of letters in each step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. She writes half of it once: 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: 52 letters (from step 1) + 13 letters (from step 2) = 65 letters

Total number of letters written by Elise: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters

The final answer is: 130"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

The initial weight of Mark was 100 pounds."
"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2
The total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost of the items Carly ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her commission into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, her commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, her commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings: $300 + $150 = $450.

"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. Then, we multiply this time by 3 to find the time it takes to swim 3 miles: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). 

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 90 - 50
New angle = 40 degrees

"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many candles James needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James needs 12 candles for him and 8 candles for the younger son. 

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost of the candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received half of that amount for each of the last two teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can start by determining the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals, we can set up an equation to find the number of goals scored by Mark:

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can set up another equation to find the number of goals scored by Anna:

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Amount made by Liam = $63
Amount made by Mitchell = $84

Difference in the amount made by Mitchell and Liam = Amount made by Mitchell - Amount made by Liam
Difference in the amount made by Mitchell and Liam = $84 - $63

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spent: $20 (wooden) + $6 (plastic) = $26.

Since Peter started with $70, he has $70 - $26 = $44 left.

The number of wooden action figures Peter bought is $20 / $5 = 4.
The number of plastic action figures Peter bought is $6 / $2 = 3.

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4 (wooden) + 3 (plastic) = 7.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 7."

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly requirement by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 1 year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

For 2 years, the total amount removed would be $1200 * 2 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

$600"

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
450 * 1.04 = 468

However, the actual temperature is 468, so we need to find the temperature that is 4% lower than the actual temperature. 
468 * 0.96 = 447.12

So, Maggie should set the oven to 447.12 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) to the time of the second movie (125 minutes) to get the total time. 

90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts as follows:
Total cost / Total number of pairs = Cost per pair
$180.00 / 90 = $2.00

So, each pair of contacts will cost $2.00."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.
John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.
Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex initially invites 100 people. Each of these people invites 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invites 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total.

Now, we add the initial 100 people, the 200 additional guests, and the 18 additional friends and spouses: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert all the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 1: 10 + 12 = 22 games.

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 10 + 24 = 34 games.

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 58."
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year and then divide that by the number of rotations it can withstand.

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations per year:

Number of rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile
Total rotations per year = 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/year

Now, let's calculate the number of years the tire can withstand:

Total rotations the tire can withstand = 10,440,000 rotations
Number of rotations per year = 145,000 rotations/year

Number of years the tire can withstand = Total rotations the tire can withstand / Number of rotations per year
= 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/year
= 72 years

The tire will need to be replaced in 72 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we assume it's 8% of the total cost (this is a common sales tax rate). 8% of $52.50 is 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20.

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost: $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70. Since Joe can't spend a negative amount, he will be short $6.70.

Joe will have -$6.70 left after the purchase."
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4) = 18

Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18 = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3) = 18

Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones from the total number of street lights: 16 - 20 = -4. 

Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning street lights, this indicates that the initial calculation of total street lights was incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the total number of street lights. If each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the correct total number of street lights should be 4 * 4 = 16. 

However, the question states that 20 street lights are not working, which is more than the total number of street lights. This is an inconsistency. 

Assuming the question meant to say that there are 20 street lights that are not working, and the total number of street lights is indeed 16, we can proceed with the calculation: 16 - 20 = -4. 

However, since we cannot have a negative number of functioning street lights, we should re-evaluate the question. 

Let's assume the question meant to say that there are 20 street lights in total, and 4 of them are not working at each intersection. 

In this case, the total number of street lights is 20, and the number of non-functioning street lights at each intersection is 4. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of non-functioning street lights is 4 * 4 = 16. 

Now, we subtract the total number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To determine the total number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the number of pieces he chews throughout the day and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial 20 pieces: 20 - 6 = 14.

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

Then, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days to get the overall total:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches). 

First, convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Now, we know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
= 4/5 * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so S = 16.

We also know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Lastly, we know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is approaching Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from that total.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the total cost exceeds $100 (10 classes * $10 per class).

Let's calculate the number of classes Manny can miss:

Total cost of classes = $60
Maximum cost per class = $10
Number of classes = 10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can afford to miss, we can subtract the total cost from the maximum cost:

Maximum number of classes Manny can afford to miss = Maximum cost per class * Number of classes - Total cost of classes
= $10 * 10 - $60
= $100 - $60
= $40

Since Manny can afford to miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers each person processes per day. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed per day is 50 (by Jewel) + 100 (by Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50.

Now, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67 (approximately)

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current salary to get his new monthly salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $21666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$21666.67 * 12 = $26000

The final answer is: $26000"

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms: 
20000 + 2000 = 70x - x 
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69: 
x = 22000 / 69 
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now that we know the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes. 
Total likes = initial likes + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 319 + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 21919"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost for her was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for her was 20 * $30 * (1 - 0.10) = 20 * $30 * 0.90 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, let's calculate the total sales for two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the bank: Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount: $200 + $420 = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld is the difference between the total amount in the bank and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert 24 eggs into dozens. To do this, we divide 24 by 12, which gives us 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly rent: $5,000
Monthly fuel cost: 2 * $5,000 = $10,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total cost of rent and fuel for the year as follows:

Total rent for the year: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000
Total fuel cost for the year: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, we can calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year by adding the initial cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost:

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as R, the time to cook pork as P, and the time to cook beans as B.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

We also know that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50.

Additionally, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so B = (P + R) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40.

Now, we need to find the total time it took to cook all the food. The total time is the sum of the time it took to cook each food item: Total time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3.
Each person's share = Total money / 3
Each person's share = $360 / 3
Each person's share = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the additional 5 minutes for the extended quarter.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes. 

Adding the 5-minute extension, the total game length is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

"To find out how much candy each person would have if they pool and share it equally, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 

Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3.

12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each person would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 12 (first 8) + 3 (next 3) = 15
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 8

Total days = 15 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) = 31

Since there are 31 days in the month, and Christina has 15 good days, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since he already had 12 toys, he needed 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

But when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 21 toys.

So, in total, James needs 12 (initially needed) + 12 (additional needed) + 21 (final needed) = 45 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

The sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the total weight of the 9 adults exceeds the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then add the number of cookies Katarina and Summer have.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 68 + 5 = 73.

Max has 73 cookies, and Summer has 23 more than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add the number of cookies each person has to find the total: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 96 (Summer) = 237.

The total number of cookies is 237."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

We know the final length of the dress is 140cm. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. 

Converting 0.5 hours to minutes, we get 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, he can mow half the lawn in 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have spent walking so far and subtract it from the total time available.

They have spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time available = 30 minutes

Time left = Time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time left = 30 - 19
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked by each person. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, and there are 12 months in a year, he has been saving for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so the total number of coins he has saved is 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Since Neil has been saving for the same amount of time as Rong, he has also saved for 120 months. The total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Then, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

Now that we know the total cost is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost is $100, and John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs $1.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Now, we add the costs together: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of regular chairs and high chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
= 40 + 8
= 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add 57 chairs (42 + 15) to the total number of chairs. However, Mia already has 48 chairs. Therefore, she needs to get:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of chairs needed - Number of chairs already available

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

Total drinks consumed = 14 people * 2 drinks/person = 28 drinks
Total snacks consumed = 14 people * 3 snacks/person = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (Total drinks * $2) + (Total snacks * $2)
Total cost = (28 * $2) + (42 * $2)
Total cost = $56 + $84
Total cost = $140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying 3/5 of $100. 

Gerald's share = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

Amount still needed = Goal - Amount raised
Amount still needed = $6300 - $2100
Amount still needed = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours = Amount still needed / Hourly amount
Number of hours = $4200 / $700 (since $2100 was raised in 3 hours, the hourly amount is $2100 / 3 = $700)
Number of hours = $4200 / $700
Number of hours = 6

The firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."

The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she will eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she will eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Now, let's calculate the savings: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each with 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, with 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, with 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham together: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

Therefore, the total calories in the omelet are 770.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the time spent in that scenario.

When both hands are at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, the combined rate is 200 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total. She spends 2 minutes with her arms raised and 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.

The number of taps with her arms raised is 200 * 2 = 400 taps.

The number of taps with her arms at her sides is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

The total number of taps is 400 + 1650 = 2050 taps.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by doing something that would cause damage, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually incurs a loss of $195.

The final answer is: -$195"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 people, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices they ate is 2 * ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by all the friends: 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43 slices.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 

The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. 
So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. 
Average time = (time taken by cat + time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 

2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

The remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

Then, 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00, which is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 + 2000 = 4000.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 12 groups, we divide 54 by 12.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

So, we need 5 groups to accommodate all 54 students.

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed to form, not the number of groups already formed. Since the question states ""to form,"" it implies that we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form the required 12 groups.

We already have 12 groups, so we need 0 more groups to form the required 12 groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
Since a small sticker is worth 1 small button, she gets 27 small buttons from the trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from the trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
Since a large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from the trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:

"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the number of matches he played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To find the amount you will pay after the discount, you need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 * $140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, you will pay $133 after the discount."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists = 20
Number of songs in each playlist = 300
Length of each song = 10 hours

Total number of songs = 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours = 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find the remaining people after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - People who think horse #2 will win - People who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows: 
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = Total cases / 2 = 250 / 2 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * Cases needed by the first house = 2 * 125 = 250

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 200 + 90 = 290

Therefore, George has 290 fruits in total."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To determine the cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 20 kilograms.

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of kilograms required (20) by the cost per kilogram ($3).

Total cost = 20 kilograms * $3 per kilogram = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150). 

300 + 150 = 450

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra read. 

150 + 450 = 600

Therefore, they read 600 books altogether.

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her total earnings for Monday would be:
- 4 classes * $15 per class = $60
- 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75
- Total earnings for Monday = $60 + $75 = $135

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
- 2 classes * $15 per class = $30
- 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30
- Total earnings for Wednesday = $30 + $30 = $60

Now, we need to add the earnings from both days to get the total:
- Total earnings = $135 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $195

Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus for Monday. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the daily bonus.

Therefore, Tanya's total earnings for the two days are $195.

"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents.

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to earn $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to earn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we know the cost of the movies in series and the older movies. The cost of the normal movies is $10.

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $2000 + $800 + (400 * $10)
= $2000 + $800 + $4000
= $6800

The final answer is: $6800"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the speed at which they hiked. 

The speed at which they drove is given as 50 miles per hour. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate the hiking speed as follows:

Hiking speed = (50 / 2) - 5
Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we know that it took them 1.5 hours to hike. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they hiked:

Distance = Hiking speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

Since the total time they spent driving and hiking is 6 hours, and we know the time spent hiking (1.5 hours), we can find the time spent driving as follows:

Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
Time spent driving = 6 - 1.5
Time spent driving = 4.5 hours

Now, we can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they drove:

Distance = Driving speed * Time spent driving
Distance = 50 * 4.5
Distance = 225 miles

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

The final answer is: 255"
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's score:
- She collects 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 40 + 900 = 1020.

The difference between their scores is 1020 - 820 = 200.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.
On the extra days, they ride twice the usual amount, so that's 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times.
The total number of times they ride in a week is 9 times + 6 times = 15 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 17 = -14 (this is not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 14 orange fish, leaving 3 orange fish in the tank). 

Now, the number of white fish is 4 - 17 = -13 (this is also not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 13 white fish, leaving 4 white fish in the tank).

However, the problem states that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

Let's assume the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had 3 + 2x orange fish and 4 + x white fish.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had 3 + 2x orange fish and 4 + x white fish.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + 2x = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + 2x = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

3 = 8

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the number of white fish Bob bought is x is incorrect.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to first calculate the total miles driven per week. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Since Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by 0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 by 20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = $200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of $200, we multiply 200 by 3/5.

200 * 3/5 = $120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount she had from the twenties.

$200 - $120 = $80

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the remaining amount she spent from the twenties.

$35 + $80 = $115

Therefore, Carrie paid $115 for lunch.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine the total amount he needs to cover the trip. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Half of this amount is $300 / 2 = $150. 

John has $50. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs: $150 - $50 = $100.

John is missing $100."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is heated enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total people / Group size
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells as follows:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people on the train and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people on the train: 172
Number of people who got off at the first stop: 47
Number of people who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people who got off at the second stop: 38

First, subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop: 172 - 47 = 125
Then, add the number of people who got on at the first stop: 125 + 13 = 138
Finally, subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

Total amount of money = Number of bottle caps per day * Number of days in the month * Value of each bottle cap
Total amount of money = 10 * 30 * 0.25
Total amount of money = 75

Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. So, her special pay for 3 hours is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of male lions + Number of female lions + Number of lion cubs
= 6 + 12 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40 and subtract it from $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $40 - $10
Discounted price = $30

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over.

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to all employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000 per month.

To find the total amount paid over three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The final answer is: $3,120,000."
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so singing it twice will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so singing it once will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Adding these times together, we get 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time will be 540 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate 'x':

0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours. 
30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car is faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46, or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 18 marshmallows, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 17 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids. 

17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't make half a S'more, we round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is 8."

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter = $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters = $0.625. Since there are three friends, the total cost for them is 3 * $0.625 = $1.875.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $0.25 + $1.875 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, resulting in 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8Z + G = 10.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amount of salt, oil, and citrus zest together is 2Z + 4Z + Z = 7Z. This means that the amount of sugar is 10 - 7Z = 3Z.

Substituting G = 3Z into the equation 8Z + G = 10, we get 8Z + 3Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 11Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 11, we get Z = 10/11.

Now that we know Z, we can find O by substituting Z into the equation O = 4Z, resulting in O = 4(10/11) = 40/11.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 40 by 11, which equals approximately 3.636.

The final answer is: 3.636"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half the time she walked on the first day. 

Half of 8 hours is 4 hours. 

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that point: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

Production in the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000

The final answer is 14,000."

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings.

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can start by finding the height of the mountain that Saskay can lift. 

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, their combined speed is:

Combined speed of turtles = 6 hours per kangaroo / 2
Combined speed of turtles = 3 hours per kangaroo

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Combined speed of turtles
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 (the price of the laptop after trading in her old one) plus $50 (the remaining amount she needs). 

So, we can set up the equation: x + $150 + $80 = $400 + $50

Combine the constants on the left side: x + $230 = $450

Now, subtract $230 from both sides to solve for x: x = $450 - $230
x = $220

Therefore, Erika has $220 in her purse.

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters. 

Let's divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk one cow produces (5 liters). 

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as Peter, we can find out how many dishes Peter has by multiplying Jack's dishes by 2. 

Peter has 60 * 2 = 120 dishes.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying Jack's socks by 2. However, we don't know how many socks Jack has. We know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, and Jack has 60 dishes. 

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 2x = 60 (since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks). 

Solving for 'x', we get x = 60 / 2 = 30. 

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying Jack's socks by 2. 

Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Now that we know both Jack and Peter have their respective number of socks and dishes, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together. 

The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks.

The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 120 (Peter's dishes) = 180 dishes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = Total time to clean all rooms / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the first three equations into the fifth equation:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

A = S + 2, so S = A - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14

Now that we know the ages of all family members, we can verify the sum:

16 + 19 + 14 + (3*19 - 1) = 16 + 19 + 14 + 56 - 1 = 84

This is not equal to 87, which means the initial assumption that the sum of our ages is 87 is incorrect."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to have enough for all the students and some extra."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

The final answer is: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

784"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20: 10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2.

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total: $20 - $2 = $18.

Now, we add the amount Julieta received to Rafaela's amount: $18 + $20 = $38.

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips is $38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 
The number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides: 
x = 40 
Now that we know Gretchen had 40 silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate of pay. 

First, we divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3 hours). 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she will work (12 hours). 

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had (52) to the marbles his friend gave him (28). 

52 + 28 = 80

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend. 

1/4 of 80 is 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost (20) from the total marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend (80).

80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy answers 80% of 10 questions correctly, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her total score from multiple-choice questions is 8 * 1 = 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
Amy answers 90% of 20 questions correctly, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her total score from true/false questions is 18 * 1 = 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy answers 60% of 5 questions correctly, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her total score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the scores from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens will be:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to be sold * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Desired profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Now, to find the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we need to divide the total cost by the number of chickens he plans to sell:

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Number of chickens to be sold
= $7000 / 180
= $38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

32 glasses / 3 = 10.67 glasses per person

Since we can't have a fraction of a glass, we'll round down to 10 glasses per person.

Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 10 glasses. 

The difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and Micah sold is 14 - 10 = 4 glasses.

The final answer is: 4"

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is selling the rope to her for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total amount she will receive from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will receive: $40 - $30 = $10.

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

So, 8 + x = 3 * 8

8 + x = 24

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * (1/2 * $4) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, it means Kelly has overspent her budget. She does not have any money left in her budget.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to first calculate his new hourly wage. 

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = (new hourly wage) * (hours worked per day) * (days worked per week)
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3, which is approximately 2.33. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph. 

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2 notebooks. 
The difference between Martha and Joseph is 7 - 2 = 5."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first determine the total number of cookies left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. 

Total cookies initially = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4
Cookies left = 100 - 4 = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews (6) to find out how many each will get.

Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6 = 16

Each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. 
Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages in total.
Daniel read 13 pages in total.

The difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume the pot can fill 4 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 bowls, and there are 7 people, there will be 7 - 4 = 3 bowls of soup left for the children.

Now, we need to divide the leftover soup by the number of child's bowls the pot can fill, which is 8. 

3 bowls / 8 bowls per child = 0.375. 

Since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we round down to 0. 

Each child can have 0 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To determine the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
4 small masks require 2 yards of material each, so 20 small masks will require 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

For large masks: 
3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material each, so 8 large masks will require 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

Total material needed = 40 yards (for small masks) + 18 yards (for large masks) = 58 yards.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased. 

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, so she has purchased 9 * 3 = 27 tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
14 (remaining hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking hours) = 5 hours.

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number of each.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial blue shoe boxes = 7
Used blue shoe boxes = 3
Remaining blue shoe boxes = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial red shoe boxes = 9
Used red shoe boxes = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Remaining red shoe boxes = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

6"
"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a 30-day month. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance to spend $28, we can divide this amount by 2 to find out how much each girl received. $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total available time (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

However, Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he can only see 13 - 5 = 8 more movies."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria also had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 23."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

However, they already have 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat and then find the average.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average, we add the total distances and divide by 2:
Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

Therefore, Fern will make $67,200 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The additional hours are 5 hours. 

The cost of the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

After buying the pencils, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25. 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 students and each student received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

Since the teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor cost = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total cost of parts is $60.

Now, we add the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost to get the total cost.

Total cost = $40 (fixed charge) + $70 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the total revenue from each crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To calculate the total commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper and then multiply it by the commission percentage.

For the New York Times:
6 copies sold * $5 per copy = $30
Commission on the New York Times = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

For the Wall Street Journal:
10 copies sold * $15 per copy = $150
Commission on the Wall Street Journal = 8% of $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission = Commission on the New York Times + Commission on the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between Marcus, Leo, and Deanna's ages.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent Marcus's age as x and Leo's age as 2x. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can write the equation:

x = 26 - 5
x = 21

Now that we know Marcus's age, we can find Leo's age by multiplying x by 2:

Leo's age = 2x
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 30 reports.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to bed at 10 p.m. So, the total time she usually sleeps is 8 hours. 

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the usual wake-up time. 

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to bed at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. The time difference between these two times is 7 hours and 55 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 7 hours to minutes by multiplying 7 by 60, which equals 420 minutes. Adding the 55 minutes, we get a total of 475 minutes.

However, we need to subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom, which is 5 minutes. So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 475 - 5 = 470 minutes.

The final answer is: 470"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we first need to determine how many measuring spoons he initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen (24) cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24
= 2/3 * 24
= 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

Total number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6
= 10

Therefore, Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons remaining.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and cups, which is 24 (cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34."
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 7 work emails a day. 

The remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

The other emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then use the given information to calculate Shawna's age. 

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know Shawna's age, and we are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since you can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 225."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up back at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled. Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since Robert is building a fence around his garden, we need to consider the length and width of the fence. The formula for the perimeter is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given that the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 4 boxes. So, the number of oranges she gave away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept and gave away. So, the number of oranges she sold is 240 - 80 - 60 = 100.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

We are given the following information:
1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: 
D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B:
B = 24 / 2 = 12.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of football players and the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Number of football players = 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band = 25% of the remaining students (excluding football players)
First, we need to find the number of students excluding football players: 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players = 30 - 6 = 24 students
Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band = 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Total number of students leaving early = Number of football players + Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each flower plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each flower and the space between them:
- Each flower takes up 12 inches
- There is 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each flower
- Total space required for each flower and the space between them = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space required for each flower and the space between them:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a flower, she can fit 44 flowers in her bed.

Now, calculate the total cost of the flowers:
Number of flowers Pat can buy = 44
Cost of each flower = $6
Total cost = 44 * 6 = $264

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2 to find his brother's daily consumption.

1/2 * 18 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7.

9 pretzels per day * 7 days per week = 63 pretzels per week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes in a year, but practically, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute) to get the peeling time: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the peeling time to the cooking time. So, the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

However, the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, in the 2 hours after the air conditioner was turned off, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature (which is not given, but we can call it x) and then add the warming effect:
x - 18 degrees - 4 degrees = x - 22 degrees

Since we don't know the initial temperature, we can't find the exact final temperature. However, we can express the final temperature as a function of the initial temperature.

The question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature was. Since we can't find the exact final temperature, we can't find the exact difference. However, we can express the difference as a function of the initial temperature:
x - (x - 22 degrees) = 22 degrees

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total time in seconds by 60.

Total time in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children. 

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can calculate her age as follows:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, so we can subtract their ages from the total age to find Wilfred's age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 7
Wilfred's age = 13

The age of Wilfred is 13."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies were given to the church, so the number of cookies given is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, the total number of slices is 4.

Now, we know that each adult gets 2 slices, and there are 2 adults. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time. 

Serving time: 5:00 pm
Total time: 3 hours

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 
Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

64"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly earnings = (Cost to rent the studio per week) + (Cost per student per week)
Cost to rent the studio per week = $25 * 3 days = $75
Cost per student per week = $1.50 * 10 students = $15
Weekly earnings = $75 + $15 = $90

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $90 * 4
Monthly earnings = $360

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

8230 * 0.10 = $823

The cost to fill the pool will be $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The total number of male students is 375 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1125.

Now, subtracting the total number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x * (0.93)^3 = 0.28

Now, let's calculate the values:

(0.91)^5 ≈ 0.5905
(0.93)^3 ≈ 0.8571

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.5905 * x * 0.8571 = 0.28

Now, let's solve for x:

x ≈ 0.28 / (0.5905 * 0.8571)
x ≈ 0.53

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 53%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage from wages is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly income from tips is $15 * 40 = $600. 

Her total weekly income is $400 (wages) + $600 (tips) = $1000. 

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is 0.2 * $10000 = $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly income of $1000. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8. 

72 / 8 = 9

This means each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply this rate by the number of pages he read (18 pages) to find the total time spent reading.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'L' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'S'. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total amount earned from the sales can be represented as:

$12L + $4S = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$12L + $4(2L) = $120
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs not found by the Smith twins is 100 - 60 = 40.

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 40 eggs.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich based on the given information. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2 (since she found 8, but only 2 were added to her clutch)

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 2

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 (36%)
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 (36%)
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (10%)

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.36 + 0.1 = 0.82

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.82 * 100 = 82%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 82%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first determine the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Now, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

450"
"To calculate Melissa's total earnings, first, we need to find out how much she earns per day after expenses. 

She earns $15 per day but spends $3 on parking, so her daily earnings after expenses are $15 - $3 = $12.

Since she works for 3 days, her total earnings after expenses are $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she works in total. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her total earnings by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is $2."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move to the last bottle, which is 7 intervals (or spaces) away. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds

"To find the total number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first calculate the total number of apples he has. 

He has 2 boxes of apples, and each box contains 40 apples. So, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population of South America = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 0.375 days.

Now, multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day worked: 21 days x 0.375 days = 7.875 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total days worked by 24: 7.875 days x 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Now, divide the total hours worked by the number of painters: 189 hours ÷ 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: 
Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2007 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2008 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2009 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $9,865.58 = 0.21 * $9,865.58 = $2,066.12
Price in 2010 = $9,865.58 - $2,066.12 = $7,799.46

The price of the car in 2010 is $7,799.46."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total number of cups: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72.

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle at a time.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets Greg does in a week:
- 4 twin beds * 2 sets of sheets per twin bed = 8 sets of twin sheets per week
- 1 king bed * 1 set of sheets per king bed = 1 set of king sheets per week
- Total sets of sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sets per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets Greg does in a year is:
- 9 sets per week * 52 weeks per year = 468 sets per year

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year:
- His machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, so the maximum number of sets per load is 3.
- Number of loads per year = Total sets per year / Maximum sets per load = 468 sets per year / 3 sets per load = 156 loads per year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate: 
Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10. 
Solving for x, we get x = 7. 
So Jake ate 7 slices. 

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding the slices each of them ate: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers, so the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($120), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost is $150 + $200 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

Now, we subtract the emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails:
80 - 16 = 64 emails that require a response.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5:
64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 

315 - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Now, we divide the remaining bananas by 3 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day. 

291 / 3 = 97 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats 97 bananas each day."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces within an hour.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

A dozen roses costs $15, and she bought 15 roses. Since 15 is more than a dozen, we need to calculate the cost of 12 roses and then add the cost of 3 additional roses.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she has: $5 - $21 = -$16. Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x, and the selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs, the total rate at which they create jellyfish is 5 jellyfish per second.

Next, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we can multiply the rate at which the springs create jellyfish (5 jellyfish per second) by the number of seconds in 4 hours (3600 seconds) to find the total number of jellyfish created:

5 jellyfish/second * 3600 seconds = 18000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 18000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store (half of 4 miles). 

The time it took him to walk to the store is the distance divided by his speed, which is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. The time it took him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches, which is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of MTB price): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250."
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days (Saturday and Sunday) with 24 hours each. Each hour has 60 minutes, so each day has 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. 

Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days, we need to find 1/16 of 200 minutes. 1/16 * 200 = 12.5 minutes. 

Now, we add the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 200 + 12.5 = 212.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 212.5 / 60 = 3.542 hours.

The final answer is 3.542."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet high on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the amount left before the velociraptors ate was 135 kilograms * 2 = 270 kilograms.

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 270 kilograms * 2 = 540 kilograms.

"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time per day in hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

Total time for 5 days: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that when the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of each person based on the given information.

We know Chris is 4 years old.

Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000
Annual expenses = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Annual savings needed = Annual expenses - Annual savings
Annual savings needed = $40,000 - $20,000 = $20,000

Since Lauren wants to save for 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save:
Total savings needed = Annual savings needed * Number of years
Total savings needed = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Now, we can calculate how many years she needs to work to save the required amount:
Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
Number of years = $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Since she already has 20 years of savings, we need to subtract the current year from the total number of years:
Number of years to work = Total years - Current year
Number of years to work = 20 - 1 = 19 years

Lauren needs to work for 19 more years to save for her retirement period.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can write the equation as:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce at least 20 toys per hour to meet the demand.

However, we know that the order is for 400 toys, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour. So, in 10 hours, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys. This leaves 400 - 200 = 200 toys to be produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the remaining number of toys by the number of hours: 200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker must produce at least 20 toys per hour to meet the demand.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris initially had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 23 * 2 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5 to find the 2nd fastest car's speed.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know A is also 9.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie and her brother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries. 

Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, let's denote her brother's salary as x. Then Valerie's salary would be x/2. 

We know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. So, their combined salary is x + x/2. 

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, her salary is 2 * (x + x/2) = 2x + x = 3x.

Now, we know that Valerie's salary is x/2 and her brother's salary is x. Their combined salary is x/2 + x = 3x/2.

We are given that Valerie's salary is $5000. So, x/2 = $5000. 

Solving for x, we get x = $10000.

Now that we know x, we can find their combined salary, which is 3x/2 = 3 * $10000 / 2 = $15000.

Their mother's salary is 3x = 3 * $10000 = $30000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $42000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. We can set up the equation:

2x * 40 = 2 miles

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1 mile per minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 2x
Time = 1 mile / (2 * 1 mile per minute)
Time = 0.5 minutes

The total time spent on the sidewalk is 0.5 minutes. 

The total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = 40 minutes + 0.5 minutes
Total time = 40.5 minutes

The final answer is: 40.5"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the amount of water in each mug is not specified. However, we can use the information about the temperature to infer the amount of water in each mug.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Let's assume the unknown mug has x ounces of water. We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water (since 4 ounces were poured from it). 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 4 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

This means the unknown mug has 1 ounce of water.

Now, we know the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, and the temperature of the water in the other mug is x = 1 ounce. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 1 ounce from the other mug, the temperature of the water in the other mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks).
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows.

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days.
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of cows and chickens: 
Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he received 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 3 scoops require 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, 1 scoop requires 3 / 3 = 1 potato. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 1 scoop requires 1 potato, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1 potato/scoop = 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first calculate the total number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 3: 
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold: 
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. Since the revenue is $84, Adam loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

Each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information. However, we can express the number of seashells each person got in terms of 'x'."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per day

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

460 bottles (required) - 4200 (available) = -2740 bottles

However, this is not possible since Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This indicates that Hortex cannot meet the energy demands of 2300 people with its current production capacity.

The correct answer is that Hortex cannot meet the energy demands of 2300 people with its current production capacity."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearers is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearers with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple-wearers with bows) + 1/3 * 2 (blue-wearers with bows) = 2 + 2/3 = 8/3.

Now, we can find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 

The probability is the number of purple-wearers with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 8) * 100 = 75%

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold another 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 17100 = 342000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 34200

Adding the 342000 fruits produced in the 10th year, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is 34200 + 342000 = 343200.

"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the expressions for R and B from the first two equations into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand the equation:
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was given $15 and gave $3 to her sister. 

The amount left with Rissa is 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

The amount left with Ronnie is 5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are four colors of paint and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, let's denote the amount of each color as x. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided among the remaining three colors. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x. The total amount of paint used for the other half is 2x (x for red, x for white, and x for purple). 

The total amount of paint used for the entire mural is the sum of the paint used for the yellow half and the paint used for the other half: 2x + 2x = 4x. We know this equals 12 pints. 

So, 4x = 12. 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 3. 

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20)
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box for $1:

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Cost per pod
Cost per pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = 120 / $0.12
Number of cycles = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much he used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. 

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. 

He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. 

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 13 days."

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund for 1600 gallons would be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is 1,800."

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the rate at which snowballs melt per hour: 2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour.

The net rate at which Jay builds snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can express John's age at the time of Digimon's release as '2x'. 

We also know that the time difference between now and the time of Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 - 2x = x. 

Solving for x, we get: 28 = 3x, x = 28 / 3, x = 9.33. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, Jim was approximately 9 years old when Digimon was released. 

To find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon's release: 9 + 20 = 29.

The final answer is 29."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the height of the roof is not directly given, but we can find it by subtracting the height of the second floor from the total height of the house and then subtracting the height of the first floor.

The height of the roof is 420 - 240 = 180 inches. However, this is the height from the ground to the roof. To find the height from the second floor to the roof, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from this value.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 180 = 0 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells: 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first calculate the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Then, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

288"
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

For the first medicine, Saanvi uses 14 mL. 
For the second medicine, she uses 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, she uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine.

To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we add the two amounts together: 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the total amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $275 + $6 = $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. Half of 10 diapers is 10 / 2 = 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the total number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

Given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, Tim's guess was 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans off."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the initial 5 years and the cost of the additional 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for these 5 years is 5 * 3 * $2 = $30.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for these 3 years is 3 * 3 * $5 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since there are 3 grades (4-7), the total number of students is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 30 / 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish, which will take another 45 minutes. 

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 135 + 45 = 180 minutes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is $80 (tables) + $20 (roof frames) = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 4 and then multiply the result by 3, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To determine the amount of secret seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday and then add 1 inch.

Therefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure. 

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since Karen gets a 20% discount for getting both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 

20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3. 

The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art. 

The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, we need to find 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. The remaining number of apples is 60 - 24 = 36.

Walter then gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. 25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9.

The remaining number of apples after giving 9 to his sister is 36 - 9 = 27.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is 81."

"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

So, the total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. The total grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (for the pies) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the first test:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test:

Questions needed in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions needed in the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed in the second test = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 

For the other 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There is one flashlight for each of the 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights.

In total, Brianna's family is using 36 candles and 4 flashlights.

36"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8.

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

12"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

The time it takes to hop on land is the distance divided by the speed, which is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time it takes to swim in the water is also the distance divided by the speed, which is 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes (hopping) + 10 minutes (swimming) = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

15"
"To find the total cost, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00.

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts: 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

$7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7

Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To calculate Alicia's total dry-cleaning expenses for 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost for 5 weeks: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

The final answer is: $47.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages:

Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4500 words / 0.16 words per second
Time = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60
Time (minutes) = 4.69 minutes

The final answer is: 4.69"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 1/4 * 40 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons. 

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

So, the total number of lemons required is 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
- 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
- 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
- Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of Helen's trip is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus trip cost: $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, we can subtract the initial amount Dallas had from the total number of marbles Mazie had: 52 - 25 = 27.

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets is 2 adult tickets + 1 child ticket = 2 * $12 + $8 = $24 + $8 = $32.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

The total cost is $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total weekly consumption from the total amount ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, so she spends 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is: 360 minutes * 4 = 1440 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1440 minutes / 60 = 24 hours

The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can calculate how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive for selling 70,000 bars is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.

The total amount Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of the items they purchased.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: 335"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars = 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds
The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars = 20 pounds * $6 per pound = $120

The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars = 10 * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars = 15 pounds * $8 per pound = $120

The cost of honey for 10 jars = 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds
The cost of honey for 10 jars = 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $200

The total cost of making 10 jars = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440

The total revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

The profit from selling 10 jars = Total revenue - Total cost
The profit from selling 10 jars = $500 - $440 = $60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values of all the coins together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets for herself and her sister: 2 x $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total amount spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * $4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the cookies he ate, and then add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (unchanged)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. 

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * $7 = $42.

The total earnings would be $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks as follows:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Enrollment at Norman High School
Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in enrollment = Enrollment at Norman High School - Enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can calculate the time she took to run 4 miles as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can calculate the distance he ran as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance she ran would be 2 * 16x = 32x.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is equal to 32x. We can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

4 = 32x
x = 4 / 32
x = 1/8

Now that we know 'x', we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/8)
Time = 8 * 8
Time = 64

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required length: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to first calculate the daily revenue. 

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10, and the cost of wine is $5. 

So, the daily revenue is 6 * ($10 + $5) = 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is 2 * $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then determine how many oranges each can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Since Ana peels 20 oranges and Jane peels 15 oranges in an hour, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

The cost of labor is $50 * 3 = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to get the total cost. 

Total cost = $320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. Then, we subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. Solving for b, we get b = 15. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
