"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins, but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll assume she bakes 3 muffins.

Now, she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left. She sells these 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

So, Janet makes 10 * $2 = $20 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Since it takes half that much white fiber, it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The total number of bolts required is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the original value of the house after the repairs, and then subtract the initial cost.

The house was originally worth $80,000, and Josh added $50,000 in repairs, increasing its value by 150%. 

First, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. To do this, we'll calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

New value of the house = original value + increase in value
= $80,000 + $120,000
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = new value - initial cost
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The profit Josh made is $120,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance covered in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 sessions * 3 sprints/session = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance covered in a week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, we need to find out how much feed she needs for the final meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + Feed needed for the final meal

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, we can calculate the total feed needed for the final meal by multiplying the number of chickens by 3.

Feed needed for the final meal = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups

Now, we can calculate the total feed needed for the day by adding the feed given so far and the feed needed for the final meal.

Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + 60 cups
Total feed needed for the day = 860 cups

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances traveled in each segment: 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since John started 180 miles away from home and drove a total of 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of planting the tree: $90
Annual revenue from selling lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintaining the tree: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of $90 needs to be covered before the tree starts generating a net profit, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

-2x/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

-2x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by -3/2:

x = 9

So, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry option ($250) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as having covered the same distance on the westward journey.

On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. This distance is not related to their previous westward journey, so we can add it to their individual distances.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to know the initial distance between them. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. Let's assume the initial distance between the two trains is 'x' miles.

The total distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

The total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered on the second day to the initial distance 'x'. However, without knowing the initial distance 'x', we cannot determine the exact distance covered by each train.

But if we assume the initial distance 'x' is 0, then the total distance covered by each train is:

Day 1: 80 miles
Day 2: 150 miles
Total distance = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

If the initial distance 'x' is not 0, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

Since the question asks for the distance covered by each train in the two days, and we can't determine the exact answer without knowing the initial distance 'x', I will provide the answer assuming the initial distance 'x' is 0.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching is 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year = $35,000.

Her annual salary from coaching is 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats in 4 weeks: 336 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 28 dozens.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance covered so far. Marissa has covered 4 miles and 2 miles, for a total of 6 miles.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, the remaining time she needs to spend is:
Remaining time = Total time - Time spent so far
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Since Marissa needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we can calculate the required speed as follows:
Required speed = Total distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 46/3 ≈ 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's current age:

Raymond's current age - son's age = 25 - 23 = 2 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the first stop. 

The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours spent per week.

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins is 110. 

The equation can be written as: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt to find the total amount spent: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has after selling the Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. 

After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, the initial amount of money he had must have been $35 + $5 = $40.

Now, we know that he initially had $40 and he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount of money by the price of each Lego set: $40 / $15 = 2.67.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we can round down to 2 sets. But we need to consider that he initially had 13 sets, so he must have had more than 2 sets. 

Let's re-evaluate the calculation: $40 / $15 = 2.67. This means he had 2 full sets and 0.67 of another set. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we can round down to 2 full sets and 0.67 of another set is actually 1 set (because 0.67 is more than 0.5, so we round up to the nearest whole number).

Let's re-evaluate the calculation: $40 / $15 = 2.67. This means he had 2 full sets and 0.67 of another set. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we can round down to 2 full sets and 0.67 of another set is actually 1 set (because 0.67 is more than 0.5, so we round up to the nearest whole number). 

So, he initially had 2 full sets and 1 set, which is 3 sets.

"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed as follows:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 6 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 2 miles per hour

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Let's assume the total time is 6 hours. So, the time spent running is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walked = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as x. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther with the gemstone, the distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the distance the javelin can reach with the gemstone (3x) is still within the dragon's reach of 1000 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x ≤ 1000

To find the maximum distance Polly can throw with the gemstone, we divide both sides by 3: x ≤ 1000 / 3
x ≤ 333.33

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone. This distance is the difference between the distance with the gemstone (3x) and the dragon's reach (1000 feet). 

So, the distance outside the dragon's reach is 3x - 1000. 

Substituting the value of x, we get: 3(333.33) - 1000 = 1000 - 1000 = 0

"To find the total number of pieces taken by the guests, we need to first find the total number of pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces initially available is 5 x 8 = 40.

We know that 14 pieces were remaining at the end of the evening. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available: 40 - 14 = 26.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to first determine the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost = Cost of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles
Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles.
Cost of beeswax = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00
Cost of wicks = 20 candles * $0.50 (assuming $0.50 per candle for wicks) = $10.00
Total cost = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $30.00 = $10.00

The final answer is: $10.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. We know that she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. 

Let's denote the total number of Post-it notes Candice initially had as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we add 220 to both sides of the equation:

x = 23 + 220
x = 243

So, Candice initially had 243 Post-it notes.

Now, we know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse and 243 in total. To find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased, we subtract the initial number from the total:

Number of Post-it notes in the package = Total number of Post-it notes - Initial number of Post-it notes
= 243 - 80
= 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly earnings:
147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 * $60 (truck tires) + 4 * $40 (car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 * $40 (car tires) = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. The total number of kittens is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2. 

Initial number of lollipops = 30
Number of lollipops eaten = 2
Remaining lollipops = Initial number of lollipops - Number of lollipops eaten
Remaining lollipops = 30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

Number of bags = Remaining lollipops / 2
Number of bags = 28 / 2
Number of bags = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide his available budget by that amount.

The total cost of a movie outing is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we can divide Peter's available budget by the total cost of a movie outing to find out how many times he can go to the movies: 

42 / 14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down her pension into two parts: the initial 20 years of full pension and the remaining 10 years of partial pension.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, her annual pension increases by 5% each year. 

We can calculate the annual pension for the remaining 10 years as follows:

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $58,131.25
Year 24: $58,131.25 * 1.05 = $61,240.81
Year 25: $61,240.81 * 1.05 = $64,453.08
Year 26: $64,453.08 * 1.05 = $67,750.34
Year 27: $67,750.34 * 1.05 = $71,157.85
Year 28: $71,157.85 * 1.05 = $74,659.31
Year 29: $74,659.31 * 1.05 = $78,261.93
Year 30: $78,261.93 * 1.05 = $82,000.00

The total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the remaining 10 years:

The final answer is: $132,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial payment for the first half of the year and the reduced payment for the second half of the year.

The initial payment for the first half of the year is $140. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total payment for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less money. To find the reduced amount, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140. 

10% of $140 is 0.1 * $140 = $14. 

The reduced amount for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total payment for the second half is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the total payment for the first half and the second half to find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract the amount used from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We can do this by dividing the remaining gas by the miles she has already traveled since the last fill-up.

Miles per gallon (mpg) = Total miles traveled / Total gallons used
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gas to find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank.

Distance = Miles per gallon * Remaining gallons
Distance = 25 miles/gallon * 8 gallons
Distance = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches for each team and then multiply by the number of schools.

Each team has 5 players and 1 coach, so the total number of people per team is 5 + 1 = 6.

Since there are 2 teams per school, the total number of people per school is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 schools, so the total number of people sent by all schools is 12 * 4 = 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to first identify the number of rubies and emeralds. 

We know there are 175 diamonds. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Since there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:
Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we can calculate the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is 36."

"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to first calculate her daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Judy teaches 5 classes per weekday, so her weekday earnings are 5 classes/day * $15.00/class = $75.00/day.

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so her Saturday earnings are 8 classes * $15.00/class = $120.00.

Now, let's calculate her weekly earnings: 
$75.00/day * 5 days (weekdays) = $375.00
$120.00 (Saturday) + $375.00 = $495.00

Judy makes $495.00 in a week."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all units is 5 units * $3 per unit = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the amount of laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing Sarah's amount by 4. 

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's amount by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages.

For the 3-for-$2.50 package, we can calculate the cost as follows:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

For the 2-for-$1 package, we can calculate the cost as follows:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in the 2-for-$1 package is the better option.

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be written as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time can be represented as x + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 38.

Solving for x, we get x = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds. This means Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed is 36 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new speed by multiplying his original speed by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement). 

Gerald's new speed = 36 * 1.1 = 39.6 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds with his improved diet."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the jam is the total number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the jam in the first 15 minutes as x. We know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

The total number of cars that drove through the jam is x + 20. We also know that the total number of cars on the motorway is 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

She currently has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she currently has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and add them together.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages to be read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete the reading, we need to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

The fog bank will take 14 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find the number of pieces left, we first need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces placed is 250 (by Poppy) + 250 (by her mom) = 500 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces left to be placed is 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces.

"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we need to first determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookies as follows:

Cody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by both of them by adding their individual cookies:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5
Total cookies = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3. 

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to first calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can add the total number of roll-ups they had: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Given that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the time it will take Julia to row to the shore, which is 64 feet away:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: 12.8"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can write another equation:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of each type of board. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 per board.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

Since there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Now, we multiply the total sheets used per week by 4 to get the total sheets used per month: 60 * 4 = 240 sheets.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps Jennie put on from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps Jennie put on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are given that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on each patient and the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on each patient = 24 minutes
Total number of patients per day = 500
Total time spent on all patients per day = 500 * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the hospital:
Hospital's hourly charge = $150
Total revenue from the hospital = 200 hours * $150 = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the patients:
Patient's hourly charge = $200
Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200 = $40,000

Total revenue = Total revenue from the hospital + Total revenue from patients = $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Since the cost is not explicitly mentioned, we can assume that the hospital's cost is the same as the revenue from the hospital, which is $30,000.
Profit = $70,000 - $30,000 = $40,000

The hospital makes a profit of $40,000 per day.

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to express the number of bees in terms of the number of queens. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. Therefore, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140.

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Total income is given as $92. 

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned after the first 12 hours is 30 (initially returned) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (30) leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

However, only the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return in the next 6 hours. Since 45 bees had already returned, only 30 bees (initially left) are left to return.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 bees.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. 

Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time for Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Time for Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home. 

Waiting time = Time for Tim - Time for Steve = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 (remaining) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Adding these together, we get:
144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice, so his total distance is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering the entire length of the field, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 60 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 20 yards back). She does this 34 times, so her total additional distance is 60 yards * 34 = 2040 yards. Her total distance is 100 yards + 2040 yards = 2140 yards.

Since Blake's total distance (200 yards) is less than Kelly's total distance (2140 yards), Kelly is the winner. 

The difference in their distances is 2140 yards - 200 yards = 1940 yards.

Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $3 (cost of lemons and sugar) = $28.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar. We know that the total revenue is $28 and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Since they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons and sugar must be $28 - $25 = $3. 

Since the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, the cost of lemons must be $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

Since there are 80 Japanese participants, and the total number of participants is 240, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Number of Chinese participants = Total participants - Number of Japanese participants
= 240 - 80
= 160

We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these amounts from Zaid's total salary: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final amount of money Zaid will have left is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since we don't have any information about other items, we can assume that the total number of items ordered is the sum of these three. 

So, the total number of items ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x.

However, we are not given the total number of items ordered, but we know that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the total number of items ordered is at least the number of missing red roses. 

Since we don't know the exact number of missing red roses, we can't determine the exact number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm. However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of 'x'. 

The number of red roses is 4x. To find the minimum number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to find the smallest possible value of 'x' that satisfies the condition. 

Since we don't have any additional information, we can assume that the number of missing red roses is at least 1. This is a reasonable assumption, as it's unlikely that Sandra would order a fraction of a rose. 

So, 4x ≥ 1. 

Solving for x, we get x ≥ 1/4. 

Now, we can find the minimum number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm: 

4x ≥ 4(1/4) = 1 

Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 1 red rose by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

We already know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can find Jean's current age: J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we first need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 legs, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for the subsequent runners are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row can be calculated as follows:

- The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
- Assuming the first roll is even, the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is 2/5, since there are now 2 even numbers left out of 5 possible outcomes.
- The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of these two probabilities: (3/6) * (2/5) = 6/30 = 1/5.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/5

The difference in probabilities is (1/2) - (1/5) = 3/10.

To express this as a percentage, we can divide by 10 and multiply by 100: (3/10) * 100 = 30%.

Therefore, Jerry is 30% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mom, we add their individual shares:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total revenue from selling 'x' bags at $30 each is 30x.

The total cost includes the cost of buying the bags at $20 each and the transportation cost of $2 each. So, the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. 

So, we can set up the equation: 30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get 8x = 400.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has over the 10-year period.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of trees after 10 years.

First, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. We start with 50 trees and add the net gain of 80 trees over 10 years: 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Now, we calculate 30% of 130 trees: 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, 39 trees die. To find the number of trees left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the award on the first day of the year, so we need to add the award to his total earnings: $104,000 + $5000 = $105,000.

However, we also need to consider the raise. Since the raise is applied to his new salary, we need to calculate his earnings for the remaining 51 weeks of the year with the new salary. 

His earnings for the remaining 51 weeks would be 51 * $2100 = $107,100.

Now, let's add the award and the raise to his total earnings: $105,000 + $107,100 = $212,100.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $212,100.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after six tests. 

The total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 558 - (358 - 71) = 558 - 287 = 271.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We are also given that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Let's denote the total cost of half a dozen plates as x. Since half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates, we can write the equation:

20 * 12 = 6 * 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240 = 36000 - 1200

240 + 1200 = 36000

360 = 36000

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 36000 / 6

x = 6000

So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.

Now, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

6000 - 1200 = 4800

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost by 240:

Cost of one cup = 4800 / 240

Cost of one cup = 20

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $20.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

4x + y = 60, where x is the number of babysitting sessions and y is the number of lawn mowing sessions.

Since we know that 12 babysitting sessions will earn her $60, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

4(12) + y = 60
48 + y = 60
y = 12

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times to earn the remaining amount she needs to buy the jacket and shoes."

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the perimeter by his speed to find the time spent walking:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We are given that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

Third day customers = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

The final answer is 183."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the total amount of water lost is 16 gallons, the sum of the initial water in both pools minus the total water lost equals the current water in both pools. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + x - 16 = 4y + y

Combine like terms: 3x - 16 = 5y

We also know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so 4y = 2x. 

Substitute 2x for 4y in the previous equation: 3x - 16 = 2x

Subtract 2x from both sides: x - 16 = 0

Add 16 to both sides: x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y. Since 4y = 2x, 4y = 2 * 16, 4y = 32, and y = 8.

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

However, she will pay $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

$220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we can use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find the average age of the three in three years. To do this, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24
In three years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45
In three years, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66

Average age in three years = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3
Average age in three years = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 (Naomi) - 44 (Yuri) - 85 (Brianna) = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, which is 30 liters. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 90 liters.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first find the number of petunias he plants. 

Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 
90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

The total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and then add it to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To find the total cost of their rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour, so his total cost is:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Benji rented a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 per hour, so his total cost is:
5 hours * $18/hour = $90

Now, we add their costs together to find the total cost:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

The total cost for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The time taken to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the time taken to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the time taken for each leg: 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is 48%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add the base cost of the burrito to the additional items and the upgrade.

Base cost of the burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of additional items: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Upgrade cost: $3.00
Total cost of the meal: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces. 

Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + mom's rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle. 

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

Time in hours = 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest is 30% of 120, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36.

The remaining watermelons are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of melons ready for harvest, we multiply the remaining melons by 3/4, which is 84 * 3/4 = 63.

The number of melons not ready for harvest after the two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 
   12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

2. Tax on the cars:
   10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

3. Registration fees for the cars:
   12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add up the costs:
$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The total cost Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden:

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups have left. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he consumes per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. 

So, Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, they eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine produces per week to find the number of vines needed. 

Number of vines needed = Total tomatoes per week / Tomatoes per vine per week
= 63 / 3
= 21

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

Total slices required = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Now, we divide the total slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of pizzas needed:

Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram is essentially diluting the ink from the 25 pens to make new pens. Since he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make one full pen, we can calculate the total number of new pens he can make.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make new pens by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. 

So, for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen. 

To find out how many new pens he can make from 25 pens, we divide 25 by 5.

25 / 5 = 5

This means Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens. 

Now, we add the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens he made.

Total pens = 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

Robert = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James = Robert + 6
James = 27 + 6

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person has and the number of books they read.

Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

When Dolly reads Pandora's book, she adds 1 book to her collection. 
When Pandora reads Dolly's book, she also adds 1 book to her collection.

So, after reading each other's books, Dolly will have 2 (her original books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.
Pandora will have 1 (her original book) + 1 (Dolly's book) = 2 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they collectively read is 3 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 5 books.

"To find the total number of letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and sends.

He receives 2 letters per week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours per week writing.

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be the sum of these two:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. 

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 * 20 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We can calculate the number of boys in the third class as follows:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - (Number of boys in the first class + Number of boys in the second class)
We don't know the number of boys in the first and second classes, but we can use the fact that the school is 50% boys to find the total number of boys in the first two classes:

Number of boys in the first two classes = 50% of 2 classes = 0.5 * 2 * 20 = 20 boys

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class:

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves he killed is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 15 cougars the previous night. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves.

Total number of animals killed = 10 (previous night) + 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) + 36 (today) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

Mitchel's times = 30
Anne's times = Mitchel's times - (30% of Mitchel's times)
= 30 - (0.3 * 30)
= 30 - 9
= 21

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we can calculate Robert's times as follows:

Robert's times = 4 * Anne's times
= 4 * 21
= 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the new cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 * 20 = 400 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall will receive 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls is 400 (initial cows) + 2 * 20 (new cows) = 400 + 40 = 440 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 2 * 8 = 16 cows.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

The value of the coins is as follows:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

The total value of the coins is $1 + $2 + $2 = $5.

The value of the dollar bills is 40 x $1 = $40.

Adding the value of the coins and the dollar bills, we get $5 + $40 = $45.

Therefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate into it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height of the redwood (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood that was eaten, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30% expressed as a decimal): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

She also owes a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. 

The total amount Nancy owes is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of bananas Jamal has and then calculate the total number of fruits.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52: 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 44 (Jamal's apples) = 144 fruits.

The total number of fruits is 144."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

To find the total amount of flour Carla needs, we add the flour required for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is 62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she initially had to the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she had 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. 

Now, we add the marbles she initially had to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Maddison now has 270 marbles.

"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan amount) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes, we can calculate this as follows:

Time to heat up to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 0.4 * 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 8 minutes
= 28 minutes

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. Since it takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil, we can calculate this as follows:

Time to cook the chicken = Time to heat up to 400 degrees - 5 minutes
= 28 minutes - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

Finally, we need to find the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken. This is the sum of the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

Total time = Time to heat up to 400 degrees + Time to cook the chicken
= 28 minutes + 23 minutes
= 51 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in each house. 

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Additionally, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of windows in each house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater. 
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

Therefore, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining space is used by the sterling silver beads. 

To find the length occupied by the silver beads, subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the length occupied by the silver beads by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = Distance / Speed
= 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
= 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T / 11

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T / 11

Combine like terms:

39 = 10T / 11

Multiply both sides by 11 to isolate T:

39 * 11 = 10T

429 = 10T

Divide both sides by 10:

T = 429 / 10

T = 42.9

Since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number, but in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the exact number of medals given out, so we'll keep the answer as a fraction.

However, considering the context of the question, it's more logical to assume that the number of medals given out should be a whole number. Therefore, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is 43."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars"
"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we can multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

"To find the initial points of each player, we can start by determining the points of each player before the fourth round.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points before the fourth round: 
Mike + Jim + Tony = 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all three players have more than 20 points, they will each get an extra point.

So, the total points after the fourth round will be:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22
Jim: 18 + 1 = 19
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's calculate the total points after the fourth round:
Mike + Jim + Tony = 22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points.

In total, the two sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for both days and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the counts for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities done in two days: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370"
"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. 

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the desk, we need to consider the sequence of bids. 

The first bid is $200. The next three bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the three other people, so her bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

The final bid is $400, which is $200 (initial bid) + $50 * 3 (the number of other bidders) + $50 * 3 (Carmen's three bids) = $200 + $150 + $150 = $500.

The desk costs Carmen $500."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost of driving per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

The final answer is: $45,000"
"To find out how much time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

Time on Monday = 16 minutes
Time on Sunday = 23 minutes
Total time on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this case, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount.

Annika started with $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus he received.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. Since April has 30 days, he works a total of 50 * 4 = 200 hours in April.

His regular earnings for April would be 200 hours * $10 per hour = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus. Therefore, his total earnings for April would be $2000 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people. 

20% of 20 is 0.2 * 20 = 4.

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine the total number of loaves sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

The remaining loaves are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves. 

Half of these remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, which is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weight loss rate as follows:

Weight loss rate = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by her weight loss rate:

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight loss rate
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new limbs the person will grow in the first 15 days. 

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 5 days (total 8 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 5 days (total 13 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (total 16 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

So, in 15 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm and 2 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is 1 (arm) + 2 (legs) = 3.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that gives us $500 + $700 = $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost: $1950 - $2000 = -$50. However, since you can't spend a negative amount, we need to recalculate the total cost without the flight ticket.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was:

Population six years ago = 3000N
= 3000(26)
= 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is twice the population six years ago:

Current population of Chile = 2 * 78000
= 156000

The final answer is: 156000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and then add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people who had previous commitments from the total number of people who couldn't come: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 8.

Now, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, 16 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = V * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that the classroom has 30 boys. 

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, the number of wires will be 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the cost of the magazine first. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed: 120 / 24 = 5.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

This means the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker after adding the ice cubes.

Next, we need to add 15 milliliters of cream, which will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker. So, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought by the 5 people is x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. However, this is the total number of old records traded, not the total number of old records brought in. Since 5 people are involved, the total number of old records brought in is 5x.

We know that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, so the total number of new records obtained is 7. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained is equal to the total number of old records traded, which is 2x.

However, we are given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, not that they obtained 7 new records. This means that the 5 people traded their old records for 7 new records, not that they obtained 7 new records. Therefore, the correct equation is 2x = 7.

However, this equation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct interpretation is that the 5 people traded their old records for 7 new records, so the total number of old records traded is 7. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since the total number of old records traded is 14, and this is the total number of old records brought in, the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first calculate the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

We know that 20 people were on the bus at the third stop. 

At the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means that the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Since 5 people got in at the first stop, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in Oscar's lollipop count step by step.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 out to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: 2 * 14 = 28, so he buys 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we add the initial number of lollipops Erin has to the number her mother gives her: 7 + 10 = 17.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of net income
- Total tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate the number of ruined castles first. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins, so the number of ruined castles is 0.4 * 220 = 88.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens (2x = 2 * 20 = 40).

The number of legs of cows is 4 per cow, and the number of legs of chickens is 2 per chicken. So, the total number of legs is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. 

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240 pounds

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since this is 30% of the total time spent, we can set up the equation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do:

- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining budget: $60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $55 / $10 = 5.5

Since we can't invite half a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 5 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is equivalent to $0.25 * 4 = $1.

So, the amount of money she saves in her piggy bank per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount of money she saves in her piggy bank is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the total amount of money Billy had initially was $10, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

Number of pounds of candy = $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

The final answer is 1.33."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance between services: 900 / 18,000 = 0.05 days.

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24: 0.05 * 24 = 1.2 hours.

The train goes between services for 1.2 hours, but since we are looking for the number of days, the answer remains 0.05 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken to return home
= 3 hours + 3 hours
= 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87 - 43 (number of girls) = 44."
"To find the number of boys in the park, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5) and the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10).

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(10) = 30.

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5.

"To find Erin's initial score, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before Erin scored 14 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points, we can set up the equation:

Erin's score = 3 * Sara's score + 14

We know Erin's score is 14 and Sara's score is 8. 

14 = 3 * 8 + 14

14 = 24 + 14

14 = 38

This equation doesn't make sense, as Erin's score cannot be greater than Sara's score. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score. 

Let's say Sara's initial score is x. 

Erin's score = 3x

We know Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3

x = 4.67

So, Sara's initial score is approximately 4.67. 

Now, we can find Erin's initial score:

Erin's initial score = 3 * Sara's initial score
= 3 * 4.67
= 14

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin's initial score should be more than Sara's initial score. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. 

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score. 

Let's say Sara's initial score is x. 

Erin's score = 3x

We know Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + Sara's initial score

We know Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score, so we can set up another equation:

Erin's score = 3 * Sara's initial score

We can substitute Erin's score in the first equation:

3x = 14 + 3 * Sara's initial score

Now, we can substitute Sara's initial score in the second equation:

Erin's score = 3 * (14 - 3 * Sara's initial score)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for Sara's initial score.

3x = 14 + 3 * Sara's initial score
3x = 14 + 3x - 3 * Sara's initial score

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

0 = 14 - 3 * Sara's initial score

Adding 3 * Sara's initial score to both sides:

3 * Sara's initial score = 14

Dividing both sides by 3:

Sara's initial score = 14 / 3

Sara's initial score = 4.67

Now, we can find Erin's initial score:

Erin's initial score = 3 * Sara's initial score
= 3 * 4.67
= 14

However, this doesn't make sense, as Erin's initial score should be more than Sara's initial score. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. 

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score. 

Let's say Sara's initial score is x. 

Erin's score = 3x

We know Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + Sara's initial score

We know Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score, so we can set up another equation:

Erin's score = 3 * Sara's initial score

We can substitute Erin's score in the first equation:

3x = 14 + Sara's initial score

Now, we can substitute Sara's initial score in the second equation:

Erin's score = 3 * Sara's initial score

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for Sara's initial score.

3x = 14 + Sara's initial score
3x = 14 + 3 * Sara's initial score

Subtracting 3 * Sara's initial score from both sides:

0 = 14 - 2 * Sara's initial score

Adding 2 * Sara's initial score to both sides:

2 * Sara's initial score = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

Sara's initial score = 7

Now, we can find Erin's initial score:

Erin's initial score = 3 * Sara's initial score
= 3 * 7

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 44 * 0.25 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add up the costs for all the items:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY saves 20% after considering the materials cost, the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be 80% of the original cost, which is 0.8 * 400 = $320. 

Now, we need to find the cost of the materials. Since the DIY cost is 80% of the original cost, the materials cost is 20% of the original cost. 

Materials cost = 0.2 * 400 = $80.

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the sum of the materials cost and the DIY cost, which is $80 + $320 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then subtract the returns.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

The total number of pairs sold is 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of pairs sold is 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Given that 40% of the equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000, the number of functioning pieces is:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is the value of the functioning pieces, which is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Value of functioning pieces
= 240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

From the first half of the sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk per sheep, so she gets 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the second half of the sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk per sheep, so she gets 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are those who do not like blue, which is:
40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of 20 pupils like green:
20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Now, we can find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:
40 - 20 (blue) - 5 (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples Lucy picked each day and then add them together.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, which means she picked the same number of apples on Monday as she sold. Since she sold them for $4 each and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount made on Monday / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:

Total number of apples picked = 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday)
= 50 apples

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

Total cookies initially = 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away = 44 + 42 = 86

Cookies left = Total cookies initially - Total cookies eaten or given away
Cookies left = 65 - 86
However, since we cannot have a negative number of cookies, we need to re-evaluate the calculation.

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

M = 3650[0.008333(1+0.008333)^5]/[(1+0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.008333)^5]/[(1.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.043383)]/(1.043383 - 1)

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue from selling 36 cups of lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total cost of running the lemonade stand, we need to consider the initial cost of supplies. Since Millie spent $18 on supplies, this is her total cost.

Now, we can calculate the profit per hour by first finding the total profit. The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 12.8 hectares, which is 2/5 of his initial land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them would be 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: 
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 * 2 = $20. Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, the actual cost will be 80% of $20, which is 0.8 * $20 = $16.

Now, we can find the total cost of the streaming services by adding the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 + $16 = $26.

The initial cost of the cable package was $60. To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total work time by adding the time spent writing, recording, and editing:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2142857 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing ≈ 21.43%

The final answer is 21.43."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. Double the capacity is 2 * 36 = 72 books. To find 20 more than this, we add 20 to 72, which equals 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she initially had is 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica now has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards given away: -29
Cards received: +17

Total cards now: 50 - 29 + 17 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine the total number of slices that Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny then eats 2 slices, leaving her with 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48

"To calculate the builder's yearly earnings, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and gets paid $50 per day, so his weekly earnings are:
6 days/week * $50/day = $300/week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his yearly earnings are:
$300/week * 52 weeks/year = $15,600/year

The final answer is: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch.

For the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The new total energy usage in 30 days: 
2700 watts/day * 30 days = 81,000 watts

Now, we calculate the energy saved: 
216,000 watts - 81,000 watts = 135,000 watts

Converting the energy saved to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 

There's one zebra with 36 stripes. 

The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the first two, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed as follows:

Total number of sandwiches required = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Total number of sandwiches required = 20 / 4
Total number of sandwiches required = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:
Total amount of meat required = Total number of sandwiches required
Total amount of meat required = 5 pounds

Total amount of cheese required = Total number of sandwiches required
Total amount of cheese required = 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
Total cost of meat = Total amount of meat required * Cost per pound of meat
Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total amount of cheese required * Cost per pound of cheese
Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound
Total cost of cheese = $15.00

Total cost of ingredients = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese
Total cost of ingredients = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost of ingredients = $50.00

The final answer is: $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

We also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to the employees in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left the company. So, 10 employees left, and 30 employees remained.

The remaining 30 employees worked for the full 40 hours in June. The total amount paid to the employees in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items purchased: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two events. 

First, we know that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This means 5% of 50,000 candles will have this defect. 

5% of 50,000 = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles

However, we are also told that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles with the wet dog smell defect will explode. 

1% of 2,500 = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

= $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is A.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

T + S + A + 2T + 3S = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break down his journey into segments.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this day.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we can find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip by adding the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and 2/3 of the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

The total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x - (x + 6)) + (2/3)((x + 6) - x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3)(-6) + (2/3)(6) = 6

-2 + 4 = 6

2 = 6

This equation is not true, which means our initial assumption about the original price of the jogger jeans is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem by using the given information that Cole saved a total of $6.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x - (x + 6)) + (2/3)((x + 6) - x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3)(-6) + (2/3)(6) = 6

-2 + 4 = 6

This equation is still not true. However, we can try to find the original price of the jogger jeans by using the fact that the tattered jeans cost $28 and Cole saved a total of $6.

Let's assume the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount he saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 28). The amount he saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * 6 = 4.

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

1/3 * (x - 28) + 4 = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 28 + 12 = 18

x - 16 = 18

x = 34

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $34, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 34 + 6
= 40

The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$34 - $40
= -$6

Since we are looking for the difference in the original prices, we take the absolute value of the difference:

$6

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we still need to find the value of x.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same. We can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 30

This equation is true, but it doesn't provide any information about the value of x. However, we can use the information that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones to set up another equation:

3x + 10 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

10 = 30

This equation is not true, which means that our initial assumption is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. We can set up the equation:

3x + 10 = 3x + 30

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to use the rest of the money to buy a ticket to the amusement park. Since the ticket costs $100, he must have $50 in spending cash and $50 from selling the cards.

Let's denote the number of cards Kenny starts with as 'x'. He sells the cards for $1.5 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $1.5x.

We know that he has $50 from selling the cards and $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he has is $100. This can be represented as:

$1.5x + $50 = $100

Subtracting $50 from both sides gives us:

$1.5x = $50

Dividing both sides by $1.5 gives us:

x = $50 / $1.5
x = 33.33

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the number of cards must be a whole number. 

x = 33.33 is not a whole number, but we can check if 33 cards would work. 

33 cards * $1.5 = $49.5
$49.5 + $50 = $99.5

Since 33 cards would not be enough to cover the $100 ticket, Kenny must have more than 33 cards. 

Let's try 34 cards:

34 cards * $1.5 = $51
$51 + $50 = $101

Since 34 cards would be more than enough to cover the $100 ticket, Kenny must have at least 34 cards.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had to provide 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs in total.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 44 / 2 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which equals 7. 

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
- Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the amount in each container by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we can multiply 3/4 gallon by 8 pints per gallon.

3/4 * 8 pints = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 0.01 * 500 = 5 cents

This means he had 5 cents left. So, the amount he spent on candy bars is 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars:

375 / 75 = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. 

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends: 

20 (shared lollipops) / 4 (number of friends) = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the pieces taken
= 20 - 5
= 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti and Juris to the 6 friends, which gives us a total of 8 people.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges (34 + 22 = 56) by the total number of people (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and beef stock needed.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Since each pound costs $2.00, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open, and it is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we can calculate the final temperature by adding the initial temperature, the temperature increase due to the oven, and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the window. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. 

Given that the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes = 30/60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the total cost of the hay:
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 1/2 * $3
Total cost of hay = 16 * $1.5
Total cost of hay = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass requires 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses she can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score.

Joey's initial score: 214 points
Joey's score after scoring 26 points: 214 + 26 = 240 points
Marcy's score after scoring 10 points: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score: 240 - 235 = 5 points

Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the regular price of a popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the total cost of buying a movie ticket, popcorn, and soda at the regular price is 12 + P + S. 

We also know that the total cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and soda is 20 + 1 = 21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket, popcorn, and soda at the regular price is $2 less than the cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and soda. 

So, we can set up the equation: 12 + P + S = 21 - 2. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 12 + P + S = 19. 

We also know that the cost of a soda is $3, so S = 3. 

Substituting S = 3 into the equation, we get 12 + P + 3 = 19. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 15 + P = 19. 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get P = 4.

The regular price of a popcorn is $4."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received in the trade.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left, which are worth 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies in the trade, which are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week. 

Earnings from aluminum cans per week = 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total earnings per week by 4:

Total earnings in a month = 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) = 350.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10. 

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

She received a $1 discount, so the amount she paid is 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10% discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, the amount she paid is 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = $1.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = Total shoes before Saturday - Shoes given away on Saturday
= 100 - 180
= -80

However, since the number of shoes cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the calculation.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, but he only has 100 shoes. This means he can't give away more shoes than he has. So, he will give away all his shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = 0 shoes.

The final answer is 0."
"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                    = 1/3 * 240
                                    = 80

Therefore, there are 80 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time required to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (7 days). 

However, since Jason wants to break in the shoes in three weeks, we need to first calculate the total time available for walking in three weeks. 

Three weeks is equivalent to 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days per week). 

Now, we can calculate the daily walking time as follows:

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks."
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book to find the total number of books:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by the number of kids to find out how many books each child received:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting the kids allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts. 

So, the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything: 32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to at least one substance) = 20.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

Daily consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds
Daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
Total oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag:

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

Remaining amount = Total cost of the toy - Amount he already has
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Since he promises to save $2 daily, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

The child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Total capacity of the trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs
Total number of eggs Jaime has = 64 eggs

Number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place = Total number of eggs Jaime has - Total capacity of the trays
= 64 eggs - 48 eggs
= 16 eggs

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and there's a buy one get one free deal, the total cost for 2 packs will be the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50. 

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 * (64"" + 60"") = 3 * 124"" = 372"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 * (64"" + 60"") = 2 * 124"" = 248"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 372"" + 248"" = 876"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 876"" / 12 = 73. 

The final answer is 73."
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the number of times she got up and walked in 5 days. 

Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she walks 24 times in 5 days. 

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, the total number of minutes she walked is 24 * 5 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as A. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we can write the equation: 
A + 4 = 3 * (14)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To determine the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). 

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed.

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs
24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes

Now, we can multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost.

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs is $144.00."
"To calculate the weekly cost of bus trips without a pass, we need to multiply the cost of a single trip by the number of trips per week. 

Cost per trip = $2.20
Trips per week = 5
Weekly cost without pass = Cost per trip * Trips per week
Weekly cost without pass = $2.20 * 5
Weekly cost without pass = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost with the pass:
Weekly cost with pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the weekly cost with the pass from the weekly cost without the pass:
Savings = Weekly cost without pass - Weekly cost with pass
Savings = $11.00 - $20
Savings = -$9.00

Since we cannot have a negative savings, it means that buying a weekly bus pass would actually cost Janet $9 more than not buying one."
"To solve this problem, we need to first establish the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined. 
The total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows and sheep in both locations: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, the total calorie deficit needed is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 181 days ≈ 578 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 578 calories per day to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as L and the cost of the house as H. We know that H = 3L. The total cost is $120,000, so H + L = 120,000. Substituting H = 3L into the equation, we get 3L + L = 120,000, which simplifies to 4L = 120,000. Solving for L, we get L = 30,000. Since H = 3L, the cost of the house is H = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us the time it takes Royce:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3(22) = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Number of vlogs left to make = Total vlogs per month - Total vlogs made so far
= 72 - 54
= 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you paid, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left, which is $13. So, the amount he had left after spending $8 is tripled to $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as x. Then, he saves 2x in the second half. 

The total amount Elvis needs to save is $1125. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Now, we can find the amount he saves in the second half by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375 = 750

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $750 in the second half of the month.

To find the daily savings for the second half, we divide the amount by the number of days:

750 / 15 = 50

Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

1125"
"To find the total cost of the items Verna bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of six peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first. 

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. The total amount they have together is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

4x = 4 * 20
4x = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his workplace. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, for a total of 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

The initial weight of Mark was 100 pounds."
"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the base commission and the additional commission.

First, we calculate the base commission for the first $1000 in sales:
Base commission = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000:
Additional commission = 10% of $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Now, we add the base commission and the additional commission to get the total commission:
Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to first determine how many cups Octavia drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, we can calculate the number of cups Octavia drinks as follows:

Daily recommended cups / 2 = Octavia's daily cups
Daily recommended cups / 2 = 4 cups
Octavia's daily cups = 4 cups / 2
Octavia's daily cups = 2 cups

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, we can calculate Juan's daily cups as follows:

Octavia's daily cups * 10 = Juan's daily cups
2 cups * 10 = 20 cups

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we can subtract the recommended amount from his current daily cups:

Juan's daily cups - Recommended cups
20 cups - 4 cups

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). 

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 90 - 50
New angle = 40 degrees

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many candles James needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James needs 12 candles for him and 8 candles for the younger son. 

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she spent a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes reading in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes she spent reading (105) by 1.5 minutes per page, and then multiply by 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can add the pages she read in the first week (140) to the pages she read in the second week (100).

140 + 100 = 240 pages

Therefore, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth earned $3.00 each, half of that is $1.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $3.00 (for the last two teeth) = $11.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can set up an equation to find the number of goals scored by Mark:

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can set up another equation to find the number of goals scored by Anna:

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he buys 3 wooden action figures per day. 
3 * 5 = 15 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he buys plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he buys 5 plastic action figures per day.
5 * 2 = 10 plastic action figures per day
10 * 3 = 30 plastic action figures

Total wooden action figures = 15

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, the number of days one pair of contacts will last is:
45 days / 90 contacts = 0.5 days per pair

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 0.5 days per pair = $360.00 per pair

The final answer is: $360.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml of water.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex initially invites 100 people. Each of these people invites 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invites 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total.

Now, we add the initial 100 people, the 200 additional guests, and the 18 additional friends and spouses: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

The difference in cost between the two platforms is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since it doubles in height every day, we can calculate its height on each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Since 64 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve buys each year and add the 5 games he receives as a gift.

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, which is 12 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 12 + 5 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 24 + 5 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 48 + 5 = 53 games.

Now, we need to add the total number of games Steve has at the end of each year to find the total number of games he has after 3 years.

17 (end of year 1) + 29 (end of year 2) + 53 (end of year 3) = 99

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we can divide the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours). 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, if they worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz would make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa would make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year and then divide that by the number of rotations it can withstand.

First, we need to find the total number of rotations per year. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the total miles driven per year (400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year):

362.5 rotations/mile * 4800 miles/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can withstand (10,440,000) by the total number of rotations per year (1,740,000):

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in approximately 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the number of washings it provides. 

Cost of shampoo = $24.00
Number of washings per pump = 60

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 60 = $0.40

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.40 * 100 = 40 cents.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the amount from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost of the items. The sales tax rate is not specified, but we can assume a standard sales tax rate of 8% for this example. The sales tax on the total cost is 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20.

Now, we subtract the sales tax from the total cost: $52.50 - $4.20 = $48.30.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $48.30 = $1.70.

Joe will have $1.70 left after the purchase."
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of croissants per day by 7:

4 dozen croissants/day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of croissants to pounds of butter needed:

28 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the subsequent 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:

$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the next 5 months, the funding increased by 50% per month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the 6th month is $150,000, the 7th month is $225,000, the 8th month is $337,500, the 9th month is $506,250, and the 10th month is $757,812.50.

"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. So, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg/day.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find the number of days it will take him to sell the meat:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 491."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to first calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy sessions. 

Since John attended twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions. 

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Next, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 additional pieces.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day. We add the pieces he chews at school (4) and the additional pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner (2), so 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

Since Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum, we subtract the total number of pieces he chews (6) from the initial amount (20). 20 - 6 = 14.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we subtract 7 from 14. 14 - 7 = 7.

Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week. 

Total number of cars towed = 30 + 24 = 54.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches). 

First, we need to convert 4 feet into inches, as both measurements are in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price. So, the amount paid by the company is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500. 

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000. 

James also gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500. 

Therefore, James' total earnings are $175,000 + $17,500 = $192,500.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 25 by 0.6:

25 * 0.6 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought.

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, truck stamps as T, and rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, so T = 16 + 3 = 19.

We know that R = T - 9, so R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is approaching Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are interested in the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of fish caught by each person. 

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as follows:

Maximum number of classes = Total cost / Cost per class
Maximum number of classes = $60 / $10
Maximum number of classes = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to subtract the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for from the total number of classes to find out how many he can miss:

Number of classes he can miss = Total number of classes - Maximum number of classes
Number of classes he can miss = 10 - 6
Number of classes he can miss = 4

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers each person processes per day. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed per day is 50 (by Jewel) + 100 (by Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up an equation: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3 miles.

We know Reggie's distance is 20 miles, so we can set up the equation: 20 = Lynn's distance + 3.

To find Lynn's distance, we need to subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: Lynn's distance = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of one orange by 5.

Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The bonus amount is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67

Now, we add the raise amount and the bonus amount to his current salary to get his new monthly salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $21666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:

The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website separately and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites to get the overall total:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour in three bags is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half the speed through clay, so his rate is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time.

Total Time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total Time = 10 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since he wants to buy one of each type of cupcake, he needs 2 cupcakes for each person. 

Total cupcakes needed = 2 * 27 = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the total number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Then, she received 20000 more new likes.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it implies that Clara paid less than Sheila."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the sales of green hats in the first month. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, we need to find the total sales for the first month. We add the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as:

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Now, we add the total sales of both months to find the total amount she made in two months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the next two hours is 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first hour and the cost of the next two hours: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly rent: $5,000
Monthly fuel cost: 2 * $5,000 = $10,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total cost of rent and fuel for the year as follows:

Total rent for the year: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000
Total fuel cost for the year: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, we can calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year by adding the initial cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost:

Total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the known information:

- Cooking time for rice = 30 minutes
- Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
- Cooking time for beans = (Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for rice) / 2

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
Cooking time for beans = (50 minutes + 30 minutes) / 2 = 40 minutes

Now, we can find the total cooking time for all three items:
Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

Total cost for the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, the cost is:
(1/5 pound almonds) * $10/pound = $2
(1/3 pound walnuts) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost for the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70: 4s + 2g = 70
2. The total number of animal heads is 20: s + g = 20

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get: 2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation: (4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to: 2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: s = 15

Now that we know the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting 's' into the second equation: 15 + g = 20
Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: g = 5

Therefore, Lee has 15 sheep and 5 geese on his farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

First, we find the cost of the more expensive brand: 
20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee: 
7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42. 

Roger also buys a donut for $2. 
The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44."
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

Total class time = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the total class time by the number of weeks:
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks
Total class time = 48 hours

Now, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe (1.5 hours):
Number of recipes = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours
Number of recipes = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has initially. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find out how much money they have in total. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

If they decide to share their money equally among themselves, we can divide the total money by 3.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since he already had 12 toys, he needed 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

But when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he now needs 21 toys.

So, James initially needed 12 toys, then 12 more, and now he needs 21 toys in total.

Let's assume that the number of hash browns is directly proportional to the number of potatoes. 

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36 or 1:6.

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 36 * 96

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then determine how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally, calculate the total number of cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can calculate the total number of cookies:

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

We know the final length of the dress is 140cm. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked by each person. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for his homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies separately.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The final answer is: $36.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 months (10 years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of coins Rong saves in a year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
The total number of coins Neil saves in a year is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

After 10 years, Rong will have 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Neil will have 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after ten years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Then, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

Now that we know the total cost is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost is $100, and John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up. 

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. Therefore, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is 18 + 6 = 24.

The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Therefore, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is 68.

68"
"To find the number of regular chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5, as the problem states that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. 

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Total number of people attending = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since the total number of chairs required is 57, and there are 40 regular chairs, the number of additional chairs needed is:

Additional chairs needed = Total number of people - Number of regular chairs
= 57 - 40
= 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The final answer is 145."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great grand-babies. 

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each of whom has 3 children (her grandchildren). So, the number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great grand-babies). So, the number of great grand-babies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, we calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to calculate the total number of people and the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, there are 20 seats. 

The total number of drinks and snacks needed is 20 (people) * 2 (drinks per person) + 20 (people) * 3 (snacks per person) = 40 + 60 = 100.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is 100 * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Let's denote the weight that Gissela's truck can carry as 'x'. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can carry 'x + 800' pounds.

When Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total weight they can carry is 11,600 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine like terms:

2x + 800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Subtract 800 from both sides:

2x + Gary's truck capacity = 10,800

Since the total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600, we can set up another equation:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine like terms:

2x + 800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

This equation is the same as the previous one. We can use this information to find Gary's truck capacity. 

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (2x + 800)

Since we know that 2x + 800 = 10,800, we can substitute this value:

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 10,800

Gary's truck capacity = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

We also know there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females must equal the total number of dumplings Larry cooked. Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying his parts by the total amount of money: 3/5 * $100 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share: $60 - $10 = $50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Hourly rate = Amount already raised / Number of hours already worked
= $2100 / 3
= $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours needed = Amount still needed / Hourly rate
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

First, we need to convert 40% to a decimal: 40% = 0.4

Then, we subtract 80% (or 0.8) from 0.4:
0.4 - 0.8 = -0.4

However, since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to convert the result back to a percentage. To do this, we multiply by 100:
-0.4 * 100 = -40%

Since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to re-evaluate our approach. We should find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% (the total percentage of the river's water used by the city).

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is:
100% - 80% = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes ice cream per hour. 

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the factory makes both types of ice cream, we need to find the total rate at which it makes ice cream per hour. To do this, we add the rates for chocolate and vanilla ice cream: 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours by multiplying the total rate by the number of hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.

The total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts.

The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop to find out how many scoops she can buy:

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get:

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of the bathroom, we can calculate this as follows:

Two-thirds of 36 sq ft = (2/3) * 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we can multiply the area he wants to cover by the number of tiles needed per square foot:

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price

So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students') + 64 (teachers') = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100

= 0.4 * 100
= 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people voted by midday, we multiply 5000 by 2/5:

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

This means 2000 people voted by midday. The remaining people are:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we find the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00, we multiply 3000 by 2/3:

3000 * (2/3) = 2000

This means 2000 people voted by 16:00. The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he needs for 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs Parker will need:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes required:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together.
Combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received, as it is given that candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Since candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, candidate B received 20 + (0.50 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100, and the sum of votes received by candidate A and candidate B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, Carl has as C, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S = 4 * 56 = 224.

Additionally, we are given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = L/2. Since S = 56, we can find L by multiplying both sides by 2, giving us L = 2S = 2 * 56 = 112.

Now that we know the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. This is simply C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group

However, since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

To find the total number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

54 students / 4.5 students per group = 12 groups

Since we already have 12 groups, we don't need any more groups.

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one month by 2.

Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from this trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2(11) = 22

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts ordered:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as x. We can set up the equation:

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of the second house, so if we let x be the number of cases needed for the second house, then the first house needs x/2 cases.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house = 2 * (100) = 200

The third house needs 200 cases of shingles.

Total earnings for Wednesday = $30 + $30 = $60

Now, we need to add the total earnings for both days:
Total earnings = $135 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $195

Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus for Monday. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the daily bonus.

Total earnings = $195 + $5 (Monday bonus) = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents.

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we first need to calculate the remaining time after reading. 

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 7 + 5 - 3 = 9 hours.

Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, the time spent playing video games is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (6 / (7 + 5)) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours.

"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that Mike can get these series for $6 each. So, the cost of the series is:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost per series
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, we know that 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, the number of older movies is:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per older movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies, which are not in series and not older movies. These are the movies that are in series but not older movies. Since we already know the cost of the series, we can find the cost of the remaining movies as follows:

Cost of remaining movies = Total cost - Cost of series - Cost of older movies
= 600 * 10 - 1200 - 800
= 6000 - 2000
= $4000

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= 1200 + 800 + 4000
= $5000

The final answer is: $5000"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows: 
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour. 
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance they covered while hiking, we can multiply their hiking speed by the time they hiked: 
Distance = Hiking speed * Time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Since the total time they spent driving and hiking is 6 hours, we can find the time they spent driving by subtracting the time they spent hiking from the total time: 
Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance they covered while driving by multiplying their driving speed by the time they spent driving: 
Distance = Driving speed * Time spent driving = 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they covered while driving and hiking: 
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points can be calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on (8 - 8) = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level for 4 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 15 * 5 (for berries) + (60 - 4) * 30 (for time) = 0 + 75 + 56 = 131

Ava's points can be calculated as follows:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 3 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level for 60 + 4 = 64 seconds.

Ava's points = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 12 * 5 (for berries) + 64 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 60 + 1920 = 2780

The difference between their scores is 2780 - 131 = 2649.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars. 

64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 2 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times per day * 5 days = 15 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 times per day = 6 times per day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he already had 4 white fish, the total number of white fish after buying 'x' more would be 4 + x.

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish. So, the total number of orange fish after buying 'x' more would be 3 + (some number of orange fish from the pet store). However, we don't know the exact number of orange fish in the pet store, but we can represent it as 'y'. 

Since the total number of orange fish after buying 'x' more is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

We also know that the total number of fish after buying 'x' more is the sum of the initial fish (7) and the fish bought (17), which is 7 + 17 = 24. So, we can set up another equation:

4 + x + y = 24

Now we have two equations:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)
4 + x + y = 24

We can solve these equations to find the value of 'x'. 

First, let's simplify the first equation:
3 + y = 8 + 2x
y = 5 + 2x

Now, substitute 'y' in the second equation:
4 + x + (5 + 2x) = 24
Combine like terms:
9 + 3x = 24
Subtract 9 from both sides:
3x = 15
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

So, Bob bought 5 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles per week.

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven / Fuel efficiency
Weekly fuel consumption = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost as follows:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, we add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is heated enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total people / Group size
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Seashells per group
= 6 * 2

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

"To find the total number of square inches that Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches in one bag: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches in one bag by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know that Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we need to find the number of square inches in three inches. Since it takes 12 square inches to make one square inch, we multiply 12 by 3: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number of candies he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200).

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students on campus by the end of May.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

By the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower from the total:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 3 = 12 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 4 = 20 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 5 = 15 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 6 = 36 petals

Now, let's add the remaining petals for each type of flower: 
12 + 20 + 15 + 36 = 83 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 83."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used by both John and DeSean. 

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using 18 marshmallows, they had 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they had 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids. 

14 S'mores / 2 kids = 7 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The friend who is significantly better played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:
1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given information into the total equation, we get:
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
S + O + F + S + S = 10 (since S = G and Z = F)
2S + O + F + F = 10
2S + O + 2F = 10

Now, we can substitute O = 2S into the equation:
2S + 2S + 2F = 10
4S + 2F = 10

We also know that O = 2S and S = G, so we can substitute S for G in the total equation:
S + O + F + S + S = 10
S + 2S + F + S + S = 10
4S + F = 10

Now we have two equations:
4S + 2F = 10
4S + F = 10

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
(4S + 2F) - (4S + F) = 10 - 10
F = 0

Since F = 0, we can substitute F into the equation 4S + F = 10:
4S + 0 = 10
4S = 10
S = 10/4
S = 2.5

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * 2.5
O = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.

The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market.

"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required.

Total cupcakes required = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes required - Cupcakes already available
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Converting this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days to get the total time:

480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at the beginning of the lunch break: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game separately.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find Sasha's total points by adding the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the number of additional items Angela needs to have installed. 

She has 6 mirrors, but the firm offers installation for 4 mirrors, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the firm offers installation for 1 chandelier, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the firm offers installation for 10 pictures, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

Now, we can calculate the total number of additional items: 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 additional items.

The cost of installation for these additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The cost of the standard installation is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Eva's savings. 

Eva has saved $20.00.

Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, if we denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k', then the speed of a turtle would be 'k/2'.

We know that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours. So, the total distance covered by the kangaroos is 3k * 18. 

Now, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, the distance covered by 4 turtles in one hour is 4 * (k/2) = 2k.

To find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the distance, we can divide the total distance by the distance covered by 4 turtles in one hour. 

Time = Total distance / Distance covered by 4 turtles in one hour

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to increase his milk production by 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to have 10 / 5 = 2 more cows to produce 10 liters of milk a day.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts of all three glue sticks: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 0.5.

60 * 0.5 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes.

"To find the total time required for each group, we need to add the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. 

Time for each group = 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting the stage) = 10 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time for the intermission from the total concert time to find the available time for the groups. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Available time for groups = Total concert time - Time for intermission = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we can divide the available time by the time required for each group to find the number of groups that can perform.

Number of groups = Available time for groups / Time for each group = 110 minutes / 10 minutes = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Principal + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Principal + Interest = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Principal + Interest = $750 + $225 = $975

So, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

$975"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Total eggs = 900
Eggs per tray = 30

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

First, we need to find the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year. Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year is:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year ($2640) by the total number of pairs purchased in a year (24):

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the discount is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost is $75 + $54 - $6 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the total time required to clean all the rooms and then divide it by 2.

Total time to clean all rooms = Number of rooms * Time to clean each room
Total time to clean all rooms = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = Total time to clean all rooms / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the previous two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for a numerical answer. 

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the amount of water passing through the river doubles every day. 

On the first day, the river receives 4000 gallons of water. 
On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.

The problem states that the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day. However, this information is not necessary to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point. The correct total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 16000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 infected people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 infected people.

784"
"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is 20 * 40 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * 800 = $80.

Now, subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total, we get 800 - 80 = $720.

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is 720 + 800 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 3 x 2 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. Therefore, Amber earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices baked and sold. 

Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, the total number of loaves baked is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars. 

We know that the rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the sum of the other colors from the total number of cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, we add the points from each type of question:

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens will be:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to be sold * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= 9000

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so we can set up an equation to find the total cost:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
9000 - Total cost = 2000

Now, we can solve for the total cost:

Total cost = 9000 - 2000
= 7000

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, we can find the cost of one chicken by dividing the total cost by the number of chickens:

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Number of chickens
= 7000 / 180
= 38.89

Therefore, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale for approximately $38.89."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys (Micah and Mitchell) by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14 (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses
Number of glasses sold by each boy = 18 / 2 = 9 glasses
Number of glasses sold by Micah = 9 glasses

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.
Difference in sales = Julie's sales - Micah's sales = 14 - 9 = 5 glasses

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to sell the rope to her for $2 per meter. Since the rope is 20 meters long, the total amount she will get from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will get from selling the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. Therefore, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Therefore, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart by adding the costs of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. 

So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. This includes the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

where x is the cost of one carrot.

Now, we can solve for x:

2x + 9 = 11
2x = 2
x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To calculate Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total monthly hours are 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit: $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation to find Joseph's initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Joseph's initial number of notebooks as J. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation:

3J = 7

To find J, we divide both sides by 3:

J = 7 / 3
J = 2.33 (approximately)

Now that we know Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Martha has now. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has:

7 (initial notebooks) + 5 (additional notebooks) = 12 notebooks

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 (Martha's notebooks) - 2.33 (Joseph's initial notebooks) = 9.67

So, Martha now has 9.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

9.67"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, while Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup.

There are two children, so we divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To determine the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material per mask. To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material per mask. To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased. 

Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, she has purchased 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a 24-hour day, he sleeps for 10 hours. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on these activities is 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so Harold's free time is 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number of each.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial number of blue shoe boxes = 7
Number of blue shoe boxes used = 3
Number of blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial number of red shoe boxes = 9
Number of red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Number of red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial number of marbles Dean had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Adam's current age. 

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. 

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8
2A = 60
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since it is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can calculate it as follows:

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can add the sizes of both farms to find the total number of acres:

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres

The two farms have a total of 700 acres."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4 to get the time for the extreme sudoku: 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

y = 6

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons, and each balloon costs $0.5 for 2, the cost of 12 balloons is:

12 balloons / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
6 sets * $0.5 per set = $3

Now, let's add up the cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream:

$11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (2 * $7 ice cream) = $28

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them:

$28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up), we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours by dividing 8 by 4. 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the total money Colby has left. 

13 * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for other days cost $7, he can buy 4 / $7 = 0.57 tickets. However, he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, so he can buy 0 tickets on other days.

Therefore, Colby can see 13 movies.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 40,800 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 40,800 widgets * $6/widget = $244,800

To find the difference in earnings, subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $244,800 = $14,400

Therefore, Fern will make $14,400 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.

"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The additional hours are 5 hours. 

The cost of the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we can multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Craig's words: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we can add 50 to Craig's total.

Craig's brother's words: 300 + 50 = 350 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of Craig's and his brother's words.

Total letters = Craig's words + Craig's brother's words
Total letters = 300 + 350
Total letters = 650

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor cost = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total cost of parts is $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $70 + $60
Total cost = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

The revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.
The revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.
The revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

The total revenue is $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, we add the swimming time, rest time, and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after the events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, she now has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper and then multiply it by the respective commission rates.

The total revenue from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30.
The total revenue from the sales of 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Now, we can calculate the commission for each newspaper:
- Commission from the New York Times: $30 * 10% = $30 * 0.10 = $3
- Commission from the Wall Street Journal: $150 * 8% = $150 * 0.08 = $12

The total commission is the sum of the commissions from both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up equations. Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = 0.5L.

Additionally, we know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Now we can substitute the value of D into the equation M = D - 5 to get M = 26 - 5, which simplifies to M = 21.

Now we can substitute the value of M into the equation M = 0.5L to get 21 = 0.5L.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us L = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to get the total number of pages:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 30 reports.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 11:55 p.m. 

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 11:55 p.m. and woke up at 2:38 a.m. The time difference between these two times is 2 hours and 43 minutes. 

Now, we need to subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom (5 minutes) from the total time she was asleep. 

2 hours and 43 minutes - 5 minutes = 2 hours and 38 minutes.

Since we need the answer in minutes, we need to convert 2 hours to minutes. 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. 

Now, we add the 38 minutes to 120 minutes. 

120 minutes + 38 minutes = 158 minutes.

The final answer is: 158"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

2 dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left = 16 - 6 = 10

So, Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons and 24 measuring cups.

Total number of utensils = 10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (measuring cups) = 34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Shawna and her father, and Aliya.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age can be calculated as 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the relationships between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls that Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we have the value of A, we can find S by substituting A into equation 3:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then sum them up.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance covered in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance covered in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance covered in this direction is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird ends up back at her southern home, the total distance between her northern and southern homes is the sum of the distances covered in each direction:
Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn by his hourly wage.

$25 (amount still needed) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread and 6 + 15 = 21 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of dessert:

Gingerbread: 10 * $6 = $60
Apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $315 = $375

The final answer is: $375"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside over the 8 days.

Total hours outside = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

The number of bottles needed is 32."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 48, and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is: 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads from each person: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of football players and the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Number of football players = 20% of 30 students
= 0.20 * 30
= 6 students

Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band = 25% of the remaining students (excluding football players)
= 25% of (30 - 6)
= 25% of 24
= 0.25 * 24
= 6 students

Total number of students leaving early = Number of football players + Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band
= 6 + 6
= 12 students

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total space required for the flowers and the space left between them. 

Since Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, we need to convert this to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each flower. To find the total space required for the flowers and the space between them, we can use the following formula:

Total space = (number of flowers * flower width) + (number of gaps * gap width)

We know that Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to calculate the number of gaps. Since there is one gap between each pair of flowers, the number of gaps is one less than the number of flowers. Therefore, the number of gaps is 17 - 1 = 16.

Now, we can calculate the total space required:

Total space = (17 * 12) + (16 * 18)
Total space = 204 + 288
Total space = 492 inches

Since the flower bed is 1332 inches long, we need to check if the total space required for the flowers and the space between them is less than or equal to the length of the flower bed. If it is, we can proceed with the calculation. If not, we would need to adjust the number of flowers or the gap size.

In this case, the total space required (492 inches) is less than the length of the flower bed (1332 inches), so we can proceed.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the flowers:

Total cost = number of flowers * cost per flower
Total cost = 17 * 6
Total cost = 102

Therefore, Pat will spend $102 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate his brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

0.5 -> 0

So, Jessica can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook one shrimp. 

She can peel 6 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to peel one shrimp, we divide 10 minutes by 6 shrimp: 10 minutes / 6 shrimp = 1.67 minutes per shrimp.

Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes to sauté one shrimp by dividing 10 minutes by 30 shrimp: 10 minutes / 30 shrimp = 0.33 minutes per shrimp.

However, the problem asks for the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp. Since peeling and cooking are two separate tasks, we can assume that the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp is the sum of the times for each task. 

So, the time it takes to peel and cook one shrimp is 1.67 minutes (peeling) + 0.33 minutes (cooking) = 2 minutes per shrimp.

Now, we can find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by multiplying the time per shrimp by the number of shrimp: 2 minutes per shrimp * 90 shrimp = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 180 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

180"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effects:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

The final temperature is the initial temperature minus the net cooling effect plus the warming effect:
Final temperature = Initial temperature - net cooling effect + warming effect
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 6 degrees + 4 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 2 degrees

The difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature is 2 degrees.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up an equation to represent the time elapsed between the two events. 

The time elapsed between the two events is 75 years. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 3(30)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 0.75 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We are given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). We can write the equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20.

Substituting H = 10 into the equation, we get: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 17 + W = 20.

Subtracting 17 from both sides, we get: W = 3.

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3.

"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought: 100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies.

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 2: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as x. Since each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 6 slices in total, the equation can be written as:

2x + 2(2x) + 4x = Total size of the watermelon

Combine like terms:

6x + 4x = Total size of the watermelon
10x = Total size of the watermelon

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size 2x, we can divide the size of each adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(2x / 10x) * 100 = 20%

So, each adult gets 20% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time. 
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 

Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 8x = 64.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and it is rented 3 days a week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, so the total cost of renting the studio in a month is 12 * $25 = $300.

The dance studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. The total revenue from the students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15. The total revenue from the students in a month is 12 * $15 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total revenue from the students minus the total cost of renting the studio, which is $180 - $300 = -$120. However, since the cost of renting the studio exceeds the revenue from the students, the dance studio would incur a loss of $120 per month.

The final answer is -120."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines added each month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines added in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the new porcupines added. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can plug these values into the formula:

V = 14 * 25 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

8260 * 0.10 = $826

The cost to fill the pool will be $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo is 230 miles."
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are also told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means the other half of the students are 1500 / 2 = 750 students under 16 years old.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 750 / 2 = 375.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The total number of male students is the sum of male students over 16 years old and male students under 16 years old, which is 375 + 375 = 750.

Now, subtracting the total number of male students from the total number of students, we get 3000 - 750 = 2250.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 2250."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x + (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x + (0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

Combine like terms:

(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) * x = 0.28

Now, we can calculate the value of (0.91)^5 and (0.93)^3:

(0.91)^5 ≈ 0.5905
(0.93)^3 ≈ 0.8573

Substitute these values back into the equation:

0.5905 * (1 + 0.8573) * x = 0.28

Simplify the equation:

0.5905 * 1.8573 * x = 0.28

0.1097 * x = 0.28

Now, divide both sides by 0.1097:

x ≈ 2.54

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 2.54.

Final answer: 2.54"
"To determine the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, but the problem doesn't specify how many hours she works per week from tips. However, we can assume she works the same number of hours from tips as she does from wages, which is 40 hours. 

Her total weekly income from tips is $15 * 40 = $600. 

Her total weekly income is $400 (wages) + $600 (tips) = $1000. 

To save 20% of the cost of the car, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000, which is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000. 

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly income: $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks. 

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the total number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and there are 8 - 3 = 5 portraits. Since each portrait album has 9 pictures, the number of portraits is 5 * 9 = 45.

Therefore, Olivia had 45 portraits and 27 selfies.

45"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first determine how long it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read, which is 18 pages.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who checked out is now 24 + 15 = 39.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Now, we need to add the new guests to the remaining guests: 76 + 30 + 7 = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests.

"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

Therefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, we can set up the equation:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other individuals. 

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we can subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs left for the friends. 

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by the Smith twins) = 40 eggs.

However, we are told that 10 eggs were not found by the friends. So, we need to subtract these 10 eggs from the 40 eggs left for the friends.

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 12 = 480 pounds of ore per day.

Since the problem states that 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in a day. 

Let's denote the amount of ore that one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe as x. Then, 40 dwarves can mine 40x pounds of ore per day.

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can set up the equation:

40x + 50% of 40x = 480

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40x + 20x = 480
60x = 480
x = 8

So, one dwarf can mine 8 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, we can find the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in a day:

40 * 8 = 320 pounds of ore per day

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can find the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day:

320 + 50% of 320 = 320 + 160 = 480 pounds of ore per day

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with steel pickaxes, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

480 * 30 = 14400 pounds of ore per month

The final answer is: 14400"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. 

We know that the price of the package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the package with 4 sandwiches is $6. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of sandwiches to the price:

2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / $6 = 8 sandwiches / x

We can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 2:

1 / $3 = 2 / $6 = 4 / x

Now, we can cross-multiply:

6 = 2x
3 = x

So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $3."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of balloons Sally had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

Sally found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2 (since she only found 8, she can't add 6, so we assume she only adds 2 blue balloons)

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. 
Total number of balloons = Number of red balloons + Number of green balloons + Number of yellow balloons + Number of blue balloons
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: In this case, Marcus has to turn in his homework. The probability of this scenario is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 (since there's a 40% chance of an extension).
2. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect homework: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this scenario is 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher).
3. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this scenario is 0.4 (since there's a 40% chance of an extension).
4. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect homework, and Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this scenario is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher and a 20% chance of convincing the teacher).

Now, we add up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.1 = 1.6.

However, since the probabilities must add up to 1, we can subtract the sum from 1 to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework: 1 - 1.6 = -0.6. But this is not possible, as probabilities cannot be negative. This is because we've double-counted the scenario where the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension. This scenario is already included in the 0.4 probability of an extension.

So, we need to subtract the 0.4 from the sum of the other three scenarios: 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.2. Then, we subtract this from 1: 1 - 1.2 = -0.2. Again, this is not possible.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first calculate the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Her daily income is $15 per day. Her parking expenses are $3 per day. 

Total daily income = $15
Total daily expenses = $3
Total daily income after expenses = $15 - $3 = $12

Since she spends 6 hours a day, her hourly wage after expenses is:
$12 / 6 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is $2."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move between each bottle.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total length of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move to the last bottle, which is 7 intervals (or spaces) away. It takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle. Therefore, the total time it will take to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to first calculate the total number of apples in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box, so in two boxes, there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total cost is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5

Since there are 3 races, we divide the total amount lost by 3 to find the average: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that result by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height = initial height + growth
Xavier's new height = 4 feet + 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height = initial height + growth
Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
Difference in height = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference in height = 1 inch

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first determine the amount each person took. 

Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction of the day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days (3 weeks) = 189 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: 
Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2007 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2008 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2009 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $9,865.58 = 0.21 * $9,865.58 = $2,066.12
Price in 2010 = $9,865.58 - $2,066.12 = $7,799.46

The price of the car in 2010 is $7,799.46."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so the number of German books is 0.1 * 50 = 5.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, so the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with 1ft x 1ft tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets Greg does in a week. He does 4 twin sets and 1 king set, so that's 4 + 1 = 5 sets per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year is 5 sets/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 sets/year.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads he needs to do in a year. His machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, so the total number of loads per week is (2 + 1) = 3 loads/week.

The total number of loads he does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up an equation to find Jake's slices:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can calculate Silvia's slices:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of algebra. Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can represent Betsy's part as 'x + 18'. The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the cost of the visit, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, we can calculate the cost as follows:
$300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. Assuming the doctor prescribed 30 pills, the cost is:
$4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours:
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking:
$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

First, we find 20% of 80 emails that don't require a response: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responsive emails from the total:
80 - 16 = 64 emails

Now, we multiply the number of responsive emails by the number of days in a work week (5):
64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into two groups of 3 pounds each. 

For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price, which is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 
For the second 3 pounds, he will pay half price, which is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost will be $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which makes a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. 

The number of additional guests is 28 - 20 = 8. The cost for these additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48.

The total cost of the party is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $48 (for the additional guests) = $173.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. 

315 - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the remaining bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day.

291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

So, the third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed in the given time frame. 

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he completed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. This means he completed 500 pieces in that hour.

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed in the given hour, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75. 

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters. 

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: 162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the rate: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

80"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 0.75 * original price = $2000.

To find the original price, we can divide $2000 by 0.75: original price = $2000 / 0.75 = $2666.67.

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $2000 = $2400.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the price he sold it for: $2666.67 - $2400 = $266.67.

To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($266.67 / $2666.67) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs, the total rate at which they create jellyfish is 5 jellyfish per second.

Next, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we can multiply the rate at which the springs create jellyfish (5 jellyfish per second) by the number of seconds in 4 hours (3600 seconds) to find the total number of jellyfish created:

5 jellyfish/second * 3600 seconds = 18000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 18000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked halfway to the store, he would have walked 2 miles to get there. 

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk back home. Again, we use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home:

Total Time = Time to store + Time to home
Total Time = 1 hour + 0.5 hours
Total Time = 1.5 hours

Therefore, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then subtract the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch contains 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and Jenny buys 10 bunches, the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually to find the amount saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. The sum of their shares should equal the total length of the fence, which is 100 feet.

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we can divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its respective price.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply 300 by 0.15: 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them together: 
(105 * 500) + (45 * 250) + (150 * 450) = 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 106250.

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $106250."
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total minutes in a week is 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms of meat.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is also x. So, we can set up the equation: x = x/2.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies x = 0. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, which is x. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 2x. The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, which is x. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2x = x + 270.

Solving for x, we get x = 270.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, the initial amount is 2x. So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and then sum them up. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas remaining.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. Since the friend can choose any of the remaining sodas, the probability of choosing a shaken soda is 2/9.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 2/9 or approximately 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Jeff, Martha, and Mike. 

We know that Mike is 24 years old. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age: 
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

We also know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time per day in hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

Total time for 5 days: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to calculate 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
3.5 times 8 miles is 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three. 
52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles) = 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00 worth of merchandise. So, the new balance on her credit card is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
Adding the cost of the new items: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

Since the remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that the total number of jellyfish that change color is 6. This includes both the large jellyfish that change color and the small jellyfish that do not change color. Since the small jellyfish always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish that change color is 0. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is 6.

We can set up the equation: x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Lauren wants to save for a 20-year retirement period. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $1,200,000 at a rate of $60,000 per year. To do this, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide the number of years Lauren has already worked. 

Therefore, we can only determine the number of additional years she needs to work to save for her retirement. The answer is 20 years."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to break down the problem into steps. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means each part will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters.

Next, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. This means each of the 25 centimeters will be further divided into 5 equal parts. 

To find the length of each final cut, we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

The total height of heels is the sum of the heights of the heels worn by the 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and the 3 women wearing 2 inch heels.

Total height = (3 x 4) + (3 x 2)
Total height = 12 + 6
Total height = 18

There are a total of 6 heels at the party.

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels
Average height = 18 / 6
Average height = 3

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the initial amount he had.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He then spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. 

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

- Female goldfishes: 5

After Tate's purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 5

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their tasks: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times John visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say Brian walks x miles in 7 days. Then, we can write the equation as:

2x = 70

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 70 / 2
x = 35

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 5 workers are available, and 4 of them have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Now, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9 stickers. This means Luis had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis used half of his stickers, he must have had 2 times the number of stickers he kept. So, 16 stickers is half of the total stickers Luis had. Therefore, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. This means Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * average car's speed
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120
2nd fastest car's speed = 600 Miles per hour

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the faster car as follows:
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 2nd fastest car's speed
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600
Faster car's speed = 750 Miles per hour

The faster car can go 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
Difference = C - A
Difference = 21 - 9
Difference = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound). 

400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000.

40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can denote her speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2x * 40 = 2 miles
x = 1 mile per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
2x = 2 * 1 = 2 miles per minute

We know that the total distance is 3 miles, and we can set up the equation:

2 miles (beach) + 1 mile (sidewalk) = 3 miles

We also know that the time spent on the sidewalk is the distance divided by the speed, so the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 2 miles per minute = 0.5 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
Total time = 40 minutes (beach) + 0.5 minutes (sidewalk) = 40.5 minutes.

The final answer is: 40.5"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each tree and then add them together.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the total number of blue birds from all the trees: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he initially had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the total amount of water is not specified. However, we can infer that the total amount of water Donny has is at least 8 ounces, as he pours 4 ounces from each mug.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from each mug, the total amount of water in the second mug must be at least 4 ounces.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 ounces from the 33-degree mug) + (at least 4 ounces from the x-degree mug) = total amount of water Donny has

Since we don't know the total amount of water, we can't determine the exact amount in the second mug. However, we can determine the minimum temperature of the second mug.

Let's assume the total amount of water Donny has is 8 ounces. In this case, the second mug would have 4 ounces, and the temperature of the second mug would be at least 36 degrees (since 4 ounces of water at 33 degrees would be 132 degrees, and 4 ounces of water at 40 degrees would be 160 degrees).

However, we can't determine the exact temperature of the second mug without more information. But we can conclude that the minimum temperature of the second mug is at least 36 degrees.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks).
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows.

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days.
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of cows and chickens: 
Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 9 bagels in each pack. So, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

The total cost before the discount is 36 bagels * $10.00/bagel = $360.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $360.00, which is 0.10 * $360.00 = $36.00.

The total cost after the discount is $360.00 - $36.00 = $324.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each single bagel after the discount. To do this, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $324.00 / 36 bagels = $9.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of scoops as S and the number of potatoes as P. We can set up the equation: 
P = 6 - 3 = 3
S = P - 3

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we can set up another equation:
S = 23 - 5
S = 18

Now we can substitute S into the equation S = P - 3:
18 = P - 3
P = 18 + 3
P = 21

Therefore, Gomer ate 21 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus. 

9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus. 

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply the number of bouquets per day by 3 to find the total number of bouquets sold. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

Faraday sold 252 sunflowers in 3 days."
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. Since the revenue is $84, Adam loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

Each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information. However, we can express the number of seashells each person got in terms of 'x'."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the height of Carl based on the information given about his family members. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

The length of Carl's cane is half his height, so the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand for one person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that one bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 460 units of energy as follows:

460 units / 0.2 units per bottle = 2300 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce per day from the total number of bottles needed:

2300 bottles - 4200 bottles = -1900 bottles

However, this is not a feasible solution, as Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This indicates that the initial assumption of 20% of the daily energy demand per bottle is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, then 100% of a person's daily energy demand would be covered by 5 bottles (1 / 0.2 = 5).

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 5 = 11500 units.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 11500 units of energy as follows:

11500 units / 0.2 units per bottle = 57500 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce per day from the total number of bottles needed:

57500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 52300 bottles

The final answer is: 52300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing a bow. Since 1/3 of the total babies wear bows, the total number of babies wearing a bow is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2, since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow divided by the total number of babies wearing a bow, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 74.9%

The final answer is 74.9."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call it x. So, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can set up an equation for the 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 3 * 50 (since it produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree). Solving for x, we get x = 350.

Now that we know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree, we can calculate the total amount produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: 350 - 200 = 150 fruits
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 1600

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the expressions for R and B from the first two equations into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand the equation:
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to her sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

5 - 3 = $2

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the remaining three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining half by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

12 pints / 2 = 6 pints for the remaining half of the mural. 
6 pints / 3 = 2 pints for each of the colors red, white, and purple.

Since we are asked to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

First, we find the area of one bedroom: 
Area = length * width
Area = 20 * 12
Area = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
Total bedroom area = 4 * 240
Total bedroom area = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
Living room area = 5 * 240
Living room area = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
Total area = Total bedroom area + Living room area + Rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost per pod in the regular box. 

Cost per pod in the regular box = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.

Since the special box has 20% more pods, it contains 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Cost per pod in the special box = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles for $1 in the special box:

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * $5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed. 

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means his rate of building snowballs is 20 per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can find the rate of melting snowballs per hour: 2 / 0.25 = 8 snowballs per hour.

Since Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour and 8 melt per hour, the net rate of building snowballs per hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of building snowballs per hour: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can express John's age at the time of Digimon's release as 2x.

We also know that the time difference between now and the time of Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 - 2x = x.

Solving for x, we get: 
28 = 3x
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider the time of release as a specific point in time rather than a range. Therefore, we'll keep the exact value of x.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we need to add the time difference to Jim's age at the time of release. The time difference is the same as John's age at the time of release, which is 2x. 

Jim's current age = x + 2x = 3x
Jim's current age = 3 * 9.33
Jim's current age = 28.00

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Jim's current age = 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, so the remaining number of slices is 8 - 1 = 7.

Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by all three. We add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately. 

First, we calculate the cost of the haircut. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length of her hair decreased by 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the color. The cost of the color is $40.

Now, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color to find the total cost. Total cost = $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
= $270 + $40
= $310

The final answer is: $310"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply the frequency of each task by its respective payment and then sum them up.

For emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
For doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
For taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
For cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add up the total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

Blood in one shark = 3 * Blood in one whale
Blood in one shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in one shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

Total blood in ten sharks = Blood in one shark * 10
Total blood in ten sharks = 120 gallons * 10
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, making the total number of people 50 + 40 = 90.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 more people entered. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

Since Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted on both days: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 80.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so we need to divide the remaining amount by 3 to find out how much each person got. 

8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is 2.67."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the unknown number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

4x = 32

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
(1/3) * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
(5/11) * 44 = 20

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy loses 4 colors. 

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, we subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice the height of Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can set up an equation: 
Height of house = Height of first floor + Height of second floor
420 = 180 + Height of second floor

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract 180 from 420:
Height of second floor = 420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the house:
Height of roof from second floor = Height of house - Height of second floor
= 420 - 240
= 180 inches

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Therefore, team Gogetters found the remaining shells, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

"To find the total amount of exercise the dogs need per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles walked per dog. 

There are 4 dogs, and the average miles walked per dog is 3. 

Total miles per day = 4 dogs * 3 miles per dog = 12 miles

Since we know the total miles per day and the miles walked by the first three dogs, we can subtract those from the total to find the miles walked by the last dog.

Miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles per day - Miles walked by the first three dogs
= 12 miles - 8 miles
= 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in those months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is the initial $300 (including the interest), minus the $275 he already paid, plus the interest. 

So, the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height. Since the base is a square with sides of 6 inches, the area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches gives us a volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the total volume by this efficiency to get the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. This gives us 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3. This gives us 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, since we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900, we can calculate the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans. This is 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

Therefore, Tim's guess was 697.5 jelly beans off from the true number.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, this would mean that some grades would not be able to participate. To accommodate all grades, we need to consider the total number of students across all grades.

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is:

4 grades * 10 students per grade = 40 students

Now, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find the total number of groups:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Since each group takes 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must equal 40 feet. We can write the equation as:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric required = 2 * Total width
Total fabric required = 2 * 175
Total fabric required = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first express the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write the equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, and each person gets two treats. Since there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, we can write another equation:

C + B = 10

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure. 

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since Karen gets a 20% discount for getting both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 

20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3. 

The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, we need to find 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's denote the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can rearrange the equation:

Pomelos given away = x - x/4
= (4x - x)/4
= 3x/4

We know that Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. So, we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

Pomelos given away = 3x/4
= 3(20)/4
= 60/4
= 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

Number of novels written last year = 9
Number of quarters in a year = 4

Total number of novels written this year = 9 * 4
Total number of novels written this year = 36

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he spent traveling. Assuming he travels for 24 hours a day, the total time spent traveling is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total time spent traveling: 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 (the grapes eaten by Madeline) = 90 grapes.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = Number of classrooms * Time spent per classroom
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent cleaning classrooms to hours:
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (Total time spent cleaning classrooms / Total hours worked) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = 2.5 * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books each shelf can hold. 

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelf can hold as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, it can hold 2x books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the total number of books can be represented as: x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 110.

Combine like terms: 5x - 5 = 110.

Add 5 to both sides: 5x = 115.

Divide by 5: x = 23.

Now that we know the middle shelf can hold 23 books, we can find the number of books the bottom shelf can hold: 2x = 2 * 23 = 46 books.

The top shelf can hold 2x - 5 = 2 * 23 - 5 = 41 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Middle shelf: 23 books
- Bottom shelf: 46 books
- Top shelf: 41 books

To find the total number of bookcases needed, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. However, since the question asks for the number of bookcases, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because we can't have a fraction of a bookcase.

Total number of books: 110
Number of books per shelf: 23 + 46 + 41 = 110

Since the total number of books matches the capacity of the shelves, Elly only needs 3 bookcases."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue. Since Rose sells 3 eggs for $1, and she has 5 dozens of eggs (60 eggs), the total revenue is:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per sale = 20 sales
20 sales * $1 per sale = $20

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $20 - $12
= $8

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the total number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the minimum number of correct answers Audrey needs on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of correct answers she needs to achieve a 70% passing score on both tests.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 correct answers.

Since she needs to achieve a 70% passing score on both tests, we need to calculate the total number of correct answers required for both tests. 
Let's assume the total number of questions in both tests is x. 
The total number of correct answers required for a 70% passing score is 0.7x.

We know that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, so x = 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total number of correct answers required for a 70% passing score:
0.7x = 0.7 * 110 = 77 correct answers.

Since Audrey already got 42 correct answers on the first test, she needs to get:
77 - 42 = 35 correct answers on the second test to achieve a 70% passing score.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can express the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the expression 5x - 4:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, as a bead is not a marble.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 people * 2 flashlights/person = 8 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles. Since there are 2 small candles per room, the total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 candles. Similarly, since there are 5 medium candles per room, the total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

Now, we can add the total number of flashlights and candles together to get the total number of light sources. Total light sources = 8 flashlights + 8 candles + 20 candles = 36.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, we need to add up the time it takes to complete each side:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of helmets and then the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of helmets, robots, and footballs: 20 + 10 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes as follows:

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can divide the total minutes spent on calls per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call:

360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls per day

To find the total number of calls in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5:

24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants require a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8.

Since each of these 8 plants requires a quarter of a cup of water, we multiply 8 by 0.25: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

The time it takes Phineas to hop on land is the distance on land divided by his hopping speed: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time it takes Phineas to swim in the water is the distance in water divided by his swimming speed: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

7 boxes × $2.00 per box = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 * 2 = $40.

The cost of the four additional phones is $40 * 4 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, we can multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by 30.

Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, which is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day. 

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages:

Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4500 words / 0.16 words per second
Time = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60
Time (minutes) = 4.69 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people present on each day.

On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, which consists of 5 days. To find the total number of people for these 5 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add up the number of people present on each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 360.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 360.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 1/4 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:

1 gallon * 6 lemons/gallon = 6 lemons per gallon

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be:

5 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for this extra gallon. Since the original recipe is 1 cup of juice per gallon, the extra gallon will require 2 cups of juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons required for 2 cups of juice is:

2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 1/3 * 6 lemons = 2 lemons

Now, we add the lemons required for the original 5 gallons and the extra gallon:

30 lemons + 2 lemons = 32 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 32 lemons in total."

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the marbles dropped to the marbles he had left: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given away is 52. We know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles given away to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately and then add them together.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is one adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is $12. 

The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is one child, so the total cost for the child ticket is $8.

The cost of the popcorns is $3 each, and they bought 2, so the total cost for the popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and the popcorns together: $12 + $8 + $6 = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

First, let's add up the total number of seashells found:
214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Now, subtract the number of cracked seashells:
732 (total seashells) - 67 (cracked seashells) = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To calculate the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

For the bowls, Avery needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

For the salad plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, we add the costs of all the plates together to get the total cost:
$72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00."
"To find the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first calculate half of Steve's time. 

Steve's time = 10 hours
Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a day. 

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. 

Since there are 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs will consume 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the guests. 

There are 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we need to add those to the total. 40 + 4 = 44 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs required by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since we can't buy a fraction of a pack).

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, and John needs 8 packs. So, the total cost is 8 * $2 = $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money Frances has left:
$80 (total income) - $20 (total expenses) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making the total 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making the total 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 = 40 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

40 - 5 = 35

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals distributed = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals distributed

The total amount of money James has is 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. So, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks: 30 * 28 (days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes for meditation, and 1200 minutes for yoga. 

The total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5:

36 * 0.5 = 18

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 + 18 = 54

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of pens Timothy has, then determine the number of pens Sarah has.

Since George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has, which is half of Timothy's pens:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

4 tables * 4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws

Since James has 40 screws, we can subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has:

40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and her speed is V miles per minute. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, her time can be represented as 4 / V.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's, his time to run 1 mile is 16 / 2 = 8 minutes. Therefore, his distance is 8 miles.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran 8 miles. Since the total distance is 12 miles, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up a proportion to find Vanessa's speed: 4 / V = 8 / A. Since A = 2V, we can substitute A with 2V, resulting in 4 / V = 8 / 2V. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4 / V = 4 / V. This equation is true for any value of V, but we can use the fact that Vanessa's speed is twice Aaron's speed to find her speed. Since A = 2V, we can set up the equation 4 / (2V) = 8 / (2V), which simplifies to 2 / V = 4 / V. 

However, we can use the fact that Vanessa's speed is twice Aaron's speed to find her time. Since Aaron's time to run 8 miles is 16 minutes, his speed is 8 miles / 16 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute. Vanessa's speed is twice Aaron's speed, so her speed is 0.5 * 2 = 1 mile per minute. 

Now, we can find Vanessa's time by dividing the distance she ran (4 miles) by her speed (1 mile per minute). Vanessa's time is 4 / 1 = 4 minutes.

Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, since a person cannot be -1 years old, we need to re-evaluate the information.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then determine how many oranges each can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

Since they start at the same time, the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost separately.

The cost of the radiator is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320.

The labor cost is 3 hours at $50 per hour, which is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is: $470"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 40 - 2b + 4b = 70, which simplifies to 2b = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into c = 20 - b, which gives us c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
