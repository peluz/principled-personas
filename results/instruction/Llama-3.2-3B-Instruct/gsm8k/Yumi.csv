"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins, but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll assume she bakes 3 muffins.

Now, she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left. She sells these 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

So, Janet makes 10 * $2 = $20 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the number of sprints per session by the number of sessions per week.

3 sprints/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 sprints/week

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the total number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

The total meters James runs in a week is 540."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, we need to find out how much feed she needs for the final meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + Feed needed for the final meal

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, we can calculate the total feed needed for the final meal by multiplying the number of chickens by 3.

Feed needed for the final meal = 20 chickens * 3 cups
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups

Now, we can calculate the total feed needed for the day.

Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + 60 cups
Total feed needed for the day = 860 cups

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download again:

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. 

To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Now, we multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they travel at the same time and in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, they cover the same distance.

So, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts: 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from teaching would be: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $20/hour = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- So, her annual earnings from coaching would be: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year * $30/hour = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 336 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 336 / 12 = 28.

Therefore, Claire will eat 28 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent walking so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent walking so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the total distance is 12 miles, and we want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour. We also know the total time spent walking so far is 2 hours. 

Let's denote the time spent walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be 2 + t. 

We can set up the equation: 12 / (2 + t) = 4

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t) to get: 12 = 4(2 + t)

Expanding the equation, we get: 12 = 8 + 4t

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 4 = 4t

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: t = 1

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance in 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

To find the required speed, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the 24 liters of pineapple drink. Since the total amount is 24 liters, we can convert 26/3 to a decimal: 26/3 = 8.67 liters. 

Now, we can add 8.67 liters to 24 liters: 8.67 + 24 = 32.67 liters.

The final answer is: 32.67"
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond was 25 when his son was born. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

31 (Samantha's current age) - 25 (Raymond's age at son's birth) = 6 years

Raymond's son was born 6 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. 

So, 0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money John has:
$195 - $160 = $35

John has $35 left. Since he started with $195, we can subtract the amount he has left from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on the video games:
$195 - $35 = $160

Now, we know that John spent $160 on the video games. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we can divide the amount he spent on the video games by the price of each Lego set:
$160 / $15 per set = 10.67 sets

Since John can't sell a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that he has $5 left, which means he didn't sell all his Lego sets. 

Let's recalculate the number of Lego sets he sold:
$195 - $160 = $35. He has $5 left, so he must have sold 10 sets to have $35 left.

Now, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets:
13 - 10 = 3

John still has 3 Lego sets."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 60 miles
- Day 2: 60 / 2 = 30 miles
- Day 3: 30 miles
Total distance run per week: 60 + 30 + 30 = 120 miles

Time spent running per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total time spent running per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's average running speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 20 miles per hour

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance traveled while walking is 3 miles per hour * 4 hours = 12 miles.

The total distance traveled is 12 miles (running) + 12 miles (walking) = 24 miles.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find the number of servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams.

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total cost = Number of candles * (Beeswax + Wicks)
Total cost = 20 * ($10.00)
Total cost = $200.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The net profit is -$160.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. 

The total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 300 - 23 = 277.

277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 * $60 (truck tires) + 4 * $40 (car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 * $40 (car tires) = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000.

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.

10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half is:

$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the total amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons of gas. To do this, we can divide the remaining gas by the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car.

However, we don't know the miles per gallon of her car. We can find this out by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the remaining gas in the tank (8 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. There are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 to find out how many bags Cecilia will use in the first year.

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry = 400 pounds
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can calculate Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
Savings = $15 - $9 = $6

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (x = 7), we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them together.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

The final answer is: $1169.23"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, and she needs 12 gift bags, we multiply 0.75 by 12 to get the total number of gift bags needed.

0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed would be G - 2. 

We know that Lee's speed is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: G - 2 = 38. Solving for G, we get G = 40.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed is 40 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new speed by multiplying his original speed by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement). 

Gerald's new speed = 40 * 1.1 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 
9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes.

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce she made is half of the original volume, which is x/2 = 32 ounces.

To find the original volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the original volume of the tomatoes (64 ounces) by 16 ounces to find out how many cans she used, which is 64/16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used, which is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the ones that took an exit. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took an exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took an exit
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will remain with, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses from weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Total Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes
Time = 14 minutes

The fog bank will take 14 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has already placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because we know Frankie watched some TV on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. That's a total of 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's re-evaluate the time spent watching TV on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. We know that the total time spent watching TV on Wednesday is the difference between the total time and the time spent watching TV on other days. However, we also know that Frankie watched a 1-hour episode on Thursday, which is 0.5 hours more than the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday. 

So, the 1-hour episode on Thursday is actually 0.5 hours more than the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday. This means that the 1-hour episode on Thursday is actually 1 hour, and the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday is actually 0.5 hours less than the 1-hour episode on Thursday.

Since the 1-hour episode on Thursday is 0.5 hours more than the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday, we can say that the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday is actually 0.5 hours less than the 1-hour episode on Thursday. 

So, the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday is actually 0.5 hours less than the 1-hour episode on Thursday. This means that the 0.5 hours he watched on Wednesday is actually 0.5 hours less than the 1-hour episode on Thursday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and then determine the total amount of water taken on.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on per foot as 2/10 = 0.2 liters per foot.

Now, we know Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the rate at which she rows, we can divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate the total distance Julia rowed: 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Now, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water taken on per foot: 80 feet * 0.2 liters/foot = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of ducks in the photograph 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50x

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total amount of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps = 30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 profit per day."

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves, a third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, 20 elves quit after the first incident, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from 40, which is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, so Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home. 

Waiting time = Time for Tim - Time for Steve
Waiting time = 40 - 36
Waiting time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 (remaining) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is: 
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that came out) + 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 7

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth on Tuesday first. 

The depth on Monday was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. So, the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth on Wednesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3. 

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, let's calculate the price after 2 months: 
Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Next, we'll calculate the price after 4 months: 
Original price = $24
Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see a pattern here. The increase is doubling every two months. 
So, we can calculate the price after 6 months: 
Original price = $28.80
Increase = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the price after 8 months: 
Original price = $34.56
Increase = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

Now, we can calculate the price after 10 months: 
Original price = $41.472
Increase = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
Price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

We can see that the price is increasing by a factor of 1.2 every two months. 
So, we can calculate the price after 36 months: 
Original price = $49.7664
Increase = 20% of $49.7664 = 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328
Price after 12 months = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968
Increase = 20% of $59.71968 = 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936
Price after 14 months = $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616
Increase = 20% of $71.663616 = 0.20 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232
Price after 16 months = $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392
Increase = 20% of $85.9963392 = 0.20 * $85.9963392 = $17.19936784
Price after 18 months = $85.9963392 + $17.19936784 = $103.195706
Increase = 20% of $103.195706 = 0.20 * $103.195706 = $20.63971312
Price after 20 months = $103.195706 + $20.63971312 = $123.83541912
Increase = 20% of $123.83541912 = 0.20 * $123.83541912 = $24.76708384
Price after 22 months = $123.83541912 + $24.76708384 = $148.60250296
Increase = 20% of $148.60250296 = 0.20 * $148.60250296 = $29.72051019
Price after 24 months = $148.60250296 + $29.72051019 = $178.32301315
Increase = 20% of $178.32301315 = 0.20 * $178.32301315 = $35.6646023
Price after 26 months = $178.32301315 + $35.6646023 = $213.98761545
Increase = 20% of $213.98761545 = 0.20 * $213.98761545 = $42.79752309
Price after 28 months = $213.98761545 + $42.79752309 = $256.78513854
Increase = 20% of $256.78513854 = 0.20 * $256.78513854 = $51.457027708
Price after 30 months = $256.78513854 + $51.457027708 = $308.24216625
Increase = 20% of $308.24216625 = 0.20 * $308.24216625 = $61.64843325
Price after 32 months = $308.24216625 + $61.64843325 = $369.8905995
Increase = 20% of $369.8905995 = 0.20 * $369.8905995 = $73.9781199
Price after 34 months = $369.8905995 + $73.9781199 = $443.8687194
Increase = 20% of $443.8687194 = 0.20 * $443.8687194 = $88.76374388

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also know there are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. If she loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she loses $35/hour, her lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income:

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28. Combining like terms, we get 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we get B = 8.

Since S = 2B, we can find Seth's current age by multiplying B by 2: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the total miles he walks on the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."

Minimum monthly payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

To pay 50% more, we multiply the total by 1.5: $1000 * 1.5 = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

The yearly payment would be $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

First, let's calculate their total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's calculate their total cost. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 

To find out how many gallons they made, we can divide their total revenue by the revenue per gallon: $35 / $10 = 3.5 gallons.

Now, we can multiply the total cost per gallon by the number of gallons they made to find their total cost: $5 * 3.5 = $17.50.

So, they spent $17.50 on lemons.

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far: 
1500 + 2000 = 3500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, so we need to find the remaining amount after the donation:
6000 - 3500 = 2500

He then gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount:
2500 - 200 = 2300
2300 - 700 = 1600

Therefore, Zaid will have 1600$ left after all his expenses and donations.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of 28 is 14, and Mark was 5 years older than that, so two years ago, Mark was 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to 19, which gives us M = 21.

We already know that J = M + 2, so we can substitute M = 21 into this equation to find Jean's current age: J = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can simply multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since each member runs 400 meters.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time taken by the less well-rounded team. 

The first runner takes 60 seconds. 
The second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0 * 100) = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces.

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits: 20 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we divide the total transportation cost by the cost per bag to find the number of bags:
Number of bags = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags = $140 / $2
Number of bags = 70

However, this is the total number of bags transported, not the number of bags sold. Since the cost per bag is $20, and the selling price is $30, the profit per bag is $10. 

Number of bags sold = Total revenue / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $400 / $10
Number of bags sold = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount: 3.5 pounds
Days in a week: 7

Insects needed per day = Weekly amount / Days in a week
Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total number of trees planted is 10 * 10 = 100. The total number of trees chopped down is 2 * 10 = 20.

The total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 100 - 20 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which is 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39. The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is 91."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Amount of carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 20 + 60 = 80. Twice that number is 2 * 80 = 160 cards. So, now she has 120 + 160 = 280 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 280 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To get the total score of 558, we need to add the required score to the sum of the remaining scores (358) and subtract the lowest score (71). 

558 - 71 = 487

So, the required score on the sixth test is 487."

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Since a dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

Half a dozen plates is 0.5 * 12 = 6 plates.

The cost of 240 cups is $1200 less than the cost of 6 plates. So, the cost of 6 plates is 240 cups + $1200 = $1320.

Now, we can find the cost of one plate by dividing the total cost of 6 plates by 6. 

Cost of one plate = $1320 / 6 = $220.

Since we know the cost of one plate, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the cost of one plate by 12.

Cost of one cup = $220 / 12 = $18.33.

The final answer is 18.33."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn more from babysitting than from lawn mowing, we can conclude that she needs to babysit 12 times and mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first day. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50. 

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first day and the second day. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) = 500. 

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500. 

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450. 

Divide both sides by 2: x = 225. 

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day: x + 50 = 225 + 50 = 275. 

The number of customers on the third day is 500. 

The final answer is 275."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express x as x = 4y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 16 = 0

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4y = -16

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -4

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can start by setting up the correct equation for the amount of water in the small pool:

x - 16 = y

We also know that the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. This is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We can express x in terms of y from the first equation:

x = y + 16

Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

2y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 2y from both sides:

16 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = y

Now that we have the correct value for y, we can find the amount of water in the small pool:

x = y + 16
x = 8 + 16
x = 24

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we need to multiply the remaining amount by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining amount in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 90 (geraniums) - 40 (fewer petunias) = 50 petunias.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

The total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and then add it to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour, so his total cost is 3 * 30 = $90.

Benji rented a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 per hour, so his total cost is 5 * 18 = $90.

Now, we add their costs together: 90 + 90 = $180.

The total cost for both Carlos and Benji is $180."
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The time taken to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days. 
Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the time taken to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg: 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is 48%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the cost of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

The upgrade adds $3.00 to the total cost.
Total cost so far: $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total cost.
Total amount owed: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle:

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 / 60 = 1 hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, 36 watermelons were taken home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

To find the number of melons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the total remaining melons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for 12 cars is 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants

= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices needed by 8: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

In addition to the 25 new pens, Ram already has the 25 pens he bought initially. So, the total number of pens he has is:

25 (initial pens) + 25 (new pens) = 50 pens

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has: 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's amount: 27 + 6 = 33.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes per week. 

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week. He writes 30 pages per week, and it takes him 6 minutes to write one page, so he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate. 

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight of the redwood. 

First, we find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections. 

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds. 

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we multiply 8000 pounds by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money the girls have combined is $400."
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Finally, let's subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $18,000.

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $18,000."
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2 to find the number of golf balls.

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of bedroom windows in one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of additional windows in both houses is 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the total number of additional windows to find the total number of windows between the houses: 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"

2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter D: 5/8 of the remaining 24 = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 15."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * 15 = $180.

The final answer is 180."
"To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches. 

Now, subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used. 

17 / 0.25 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to add up the total number of stories they wrote in both weeks. 
Alani wrote 20 + 40 = 60 stories in total.
Braylen wrote 40 + 80 = 120 stories in total.
Margot wrote 60 + 120 = 180 stories in total.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to get the number of 5-star rows, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children. 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8. 16 / 8 = 2.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
The total points are 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is 83."

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day. 

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 (target) - 65 (total sold) = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made after the initial bid is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids are $200 (initial bid) + $50 (first increment) = $250, $300, $350, and $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 (initial bid) + $250 + $300 + $350 = $800.

The desk costs Carmen $800."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

Therefore, Sandy will also take 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 5 days (total 8 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 5 days (total 13 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 5 days (total 18 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 2 days (total 20 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

So, the person will grow 1 extra arm in the first 3 days, 1 extra leg in the next 5 days, 1 extra arm in the next 5 days, 1 extra leg in the next 5 days, and 1 extra arm in the last 2 days.

Total extra arms: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Total extra legs: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, after 15 days, the person will have 3 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, he has to spend $4000 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = V * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. We know that the total number of pencils Jam has is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

Now, let's solve for x: 
3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box is 8, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 
3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26

Now, let's add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can assume that each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. 

So, the total number of old records traded is 5 people * 2 old records/person = 10 old records.

The answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first calculate the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The total number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. 
To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to add the number of people who got off at the second stop to the number of people heading to the third stop: 20 + 7 = 27.

Now, we can find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal by subtracting the total number of people on the bus from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 27 - 13 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After eating 3 more that night, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find the total time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal. 

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 20 pounds (container) + 50 pounds (pink frog) + 50 pounds (blue beetle) + 50 pounds (green toad) + 60 pounds (yellow snake) + 30 pounds (red bird) = 300 pounds.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 

$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost of activities per person. However, we don't know the cost of activities per person yet. 

Let's assume the cost of activities per person is x. Then, the total number of friends Morgan can invite is $60 / x.

However, we can make an assumption that the cost of activities per person is the same for all friends. We can calculate the cost of activities per person by dividing the total cost of activities by the number of friends. 

Let's denote the number of friends as y. Then, the cost of activities per person is $30 / y.

Now, we can set up an equation: $30 / y = x. 

Since we know that the cost of activities per person is the same for all friends, we can set up another equation: 2 * $10 + $5 = $30. 

This equation is true for any number of friends, so we can't determine the exact number of friends. However, we can express the number of friends in terms of the cost of activities per person: y = $30 / x.

To find the maximum number of friends, we need to minimize the cost of activities per person. Since the cost of activities per person is $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can set x = $5.

Now, we can calculate the number of friends: y = $30 / $5 = 6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, let's convert the daily pocket money to cents: $5 = 500 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lollipops: 4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: 500 cents - 100 cents = 400 cents.

Since she saves this amount for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: 400 cents * 5 = 2000 cents.

To convert the total savings back to dollars, we divide by 100: 2000 cents / 100 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs and $2 on candy. So, the total amount he spent on candy is $8 + $2 = $10.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the total amount spent on candy ($10) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought: $10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds.

So, Billy bought 6.67 pounds of candy.

6.67"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: C = 2S - 5.

We also know that Carver is 45 years old. So, we can substitute C with 45 in the equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

To find S, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes 3 trips a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles). 

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Then, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, let's find the total number of boys. Since there are 96 students in total and 43 are girls, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Now, we know that 4 boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys: 53 - 4 = 49.

The final answer is 49."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2 since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters:

3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

Since Sara scored 8 points after the game, we can set up another equation: x + 8 = 14. 

Solving for x, we get x = 6.

So, Sara had 6 points before the game. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3: 3 * 6 = 18.

Erin had 18 points before the game.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan is making his own, he will save 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the materials is $400 - $80 = $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper, which is $320 + $400 = $720."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, the total hours for Saturdays is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week is 7 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 40% of x, which is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = (number of functioning pieces) * price per piece

We know that the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

Let's assume the price per piece is y. Then, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = 0.6x * y

However, we don't know the price per piece (y). We can express y in terms of x:

y = 400,000 / 0.6x

Now, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces in terms of x:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x * (400,000 / 0.6x)
= 400,000

This means that the total amount spent on functioning pieces is $400,000, regardless of the total number of pieces."

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. 

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

To find the total cost, we already know it's $18. 

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. 

$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade. 

$18 (profit) / 4 hours = $4.50 per hour

The final answer is: $4.50"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, 2/5 * x = 12.8

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 5/2:

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he's bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42 per month.

So, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time: 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to this gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she initially had is 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

She received 17 cards from family and friends. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica now has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards given away: -29
Cards received: +17
Total cards now: 50 - 29 + 17 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark. 

Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices.
Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so the number of slices left is 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days needed to save: $300 / $10 = 30

Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

First, we multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass: 
2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Then, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk."
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of working days in a year and multiply it by the daily wage.

First, we calculate the total number of working days in a year:
4 weeks/month * 52 weeks/year = 208 weeks/year
6 days/week * 208 weeks/year = 1248 days/year

Now, we multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage:
1248 days/year * $50/day = $62400/year

The final answer is: $62400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Then, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we convert the total energy used to kilowatts:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

The new total energy used in 30 days:
2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

Now, we calculate the energy saved:
216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

Converting the energy saved to kilowatts:
135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the total number of zebras.

First, let's calculate the total number of stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- A zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.
- A zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. 

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of:

5 sandwiches * 2 pounds per sandwich = 10 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 2 pounds per sandwich = 10 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
10 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $70.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
10 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $30.00

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$70.00 + $30.00 = $100.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's say the number of corns is x. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write the equation as:

x = 2 * 40
x = 80

So, Allan has 80 corns.

We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 (initial cannolis) + 60 (new cannolis) = 100 cannolis

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 (new cannolis) - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how long it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of these items is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog): 
5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Then, we find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:
1% of 2500 = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can find the discount amount by multiplying the regular price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = Regular price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $20 * 0.30
Discount amount = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
Discounted price = $20 - $6
Discounted price = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses to get the total cost.

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
Total cost = $14 * 4
Total cost = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples from the average trees is A.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

T + S + A + 2T + 3S = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between 6,000 feet and Oliver's current elevation of 3,000 feet. 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add up the costs for all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans, which is x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.

The difference in original price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 8 - 2 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we still need to find the value of x.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10, and the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is x.

We also know that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same. Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

We can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 3x

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 6x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders:

3(x + 10) = 3(10 + 10) = 3(20) = 60

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders:

60 + 3x = 60 + 3(10) = 60 + 30 = 90

So, Lillian can expect to see 90 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he's going to the amusement park, that means he has $50 from the sale of his cards. 

We know that he sells his cards for $1.5 each and he has $50 from the sale. To find out how many cards he sold, we can divide $50 by $1.5.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Now, we know that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. This means he sold 2/3 of his cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, 2/3 of x is 33. 

(2/3)x = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

36 guests * 1.5 (since half of the guests get two hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs

However, there were 40 guests, so the caterer actually prepared 54 hotdogs for 40 guests. This means that there are 14 extra hotdogs.

Since each guest gets two hotdogs, the caterer can give 40 guests two hotdogs each, which is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs. 

The 14 extra hotdogs can be distributed among the 40 guests, so each guest gets an additional hotdog. 

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 0.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 
Indras has 6 letters and her sister has 7 letters, so together they have 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount:

Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00
Discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon to get the total pints needed. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means that 380 cents is 99% of the money he had initially. To find the total amount of money he had initially, we can set up the equation:

99% of x = 380

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.99x = 380

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.99 to find x:

x = 380 / 0.99
x = 384.84

Since George spent $5, we can subtract this amount from the total amount he had initially to find the amount he spent on candy bars:

384.84 - 5 = 379.84

Now, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar (75 cents) to find the number of candy bars he bought:

379.84 / 0.75
= 507.11

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 507.11 is actually the amount he would have spent if he bought 507 candy bars, but he actually spent 379.84 cents, which is less than 507.11. 

To find the actual number of candy bars he bought, we can divide 379.84 by 0.75:

379.84 / 0.75
= 507.11

Since 507.11 is more than 507, we can try 506 candy bars:

506 * 0.75 = 379.5

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7 oranges per person.

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so James' swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' total time by adding his times for each segment: 36 + 85 + 60 = 181 minutes.

The final answer is: 181"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for 16 miles is:

Cost = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail
Cost = 16 * 0.5 * 3
Cost = 24 dollars

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
6 * 5 = 30 dollars

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars
Change = 6 dollars

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points he scored from the points Marcy scored. 

Marcy scored 10 points, and Joey scored 26 points. 

However, we need to consider the initial points of both players. Joey had 214 points initially, and Marcy had 225 points initially. 

First, let's calculate the net change in points for both players. 

Marcy's net change: 225 - 10 = 215 points
Joey's net change: 214 + 26 = 240 points

Now, we need to find the difference between their net changes. 

Joey's lead: 240 - 215 = 25 points

So, Joey is now winning by 25 points."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is 12 + P + S.

The cost of buying a super ticket is 20 + 1 (for the popcorn) = 21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation: 12 + P + S = 21 + 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + P + S = 23.

We know that the cost of a soda is $3, so S = 3.

Substituting S = 3 into the equation, we get: 12 + P + 3 = 23.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 + P = 23.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: P = 8.

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Now, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. 

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = $65 * 170
Total cost = $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards)
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards)
= 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 3700 / 2250 = 1.65.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. 

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, and Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. To do this, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the remoras to feet by dividing by 12: 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the total length of the remoras in feet: 1 foot.

The length of the shark is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we can divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%.

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to each substance to avoid double counting.

Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Total capacity of the trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs
Total number of eggs Jaime has = 64 eggs

Number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place = Total number of eggs Jaime has - Total capacity of the trays
= 64 eggs - 48 eggs

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will pay for only 1 pack. 

The total cost of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

However, she has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since she is buying 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 * 4 = 8. 

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 * (64"" + 60"") = 3 * 124"" = 372"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 * (64"" + 60"") = 2 * 124"" = 248"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 372"" + 248"" = 876"".

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

876"" / 12 = 73 feet.

The height of the human pyramid is 73 feet."
"To find the total minutes walked, we need to calculate the number of times Charisma gets up to walk in 5 days. Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she will get up 24 times in 5 days.

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, we multiply the number of times she gets up (24) by the duration of each walk (5 minutes).

24 * 5 = 120 minutes

Charisma walked for 120 minutes in 5 days."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find her age in four years. Since in four years she will be three times as old as Brett is now, we can set up the equation:

Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in 4 years = 42

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from her age in 4 years:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in 4 years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

The total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $224."
"To find out how many oranges Brianne brought, we need to add 20 to the number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many pies they can make. Each pie needs 3 oranges, so we divide the total number of oranges by 3. The total number of oranges is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges. 

120 / 3 = 40

They can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $432.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

There are 30 days in a month, so 8 months is 8 * 30 = 240 days. Adding the 20 days, he has a total of 240 + 20 = 260 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 105,000 / 260 ≈ 404 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 404 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation: 

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3 * Lot cost + Lot cost = 120,000
4 * Lot cost = 120,000

Now, we can solve for the lot cost:
Lot cost = 120,000 / 4
Lot cost = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can multiply the lot cost by 3 to find the house cost:
House cost = 3 * 30,000
House cost = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80.

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. Since there were 100 problems in total, one-quarter of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25 problems.

The total number of problems completed so far is 48 + 25 = 73.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 73 = 27.

Chris has 27 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Since we want to know how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can divide the total work by the number of people:

Total work = 1 house
Number of people = 5

Combined rate = 1/5 house per day / 5 people = 1/25 house per day per person

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = Total work / Combined rate
Time = 1 house / (1/25 house per day per person)
Time = 25 days

Therefore, it would take 5 people 25 days to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs, which is 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

Number of CDs = Total money spent on headphones / Cost of one CD

6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Initially, there are 48 passengers.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed to make: 72
Vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you paid, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Then, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 + $10 = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left, which is $13. So, the amount he saved is $13 * 3 = $39.

To find the total amount he has now, we need to add the amount he had left after spending $8 to the amount he saved. So, $13 + $39 = $52.

The final answer is 52."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 / 15 days (first half of April) = $75 per day

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 * 2 = $150 per day

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of April to hit his target.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. The total amount of money is the sum of what Jeff and Brad get, which is x + 4x = 5x. We know this sum is equal to $100.

5x = 100

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply x by 4 to find out how much Jeff gets:

Jeff's amount = 4x
Jeff's amount = 4 * 20
Jeff's amount = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The total number of families notified is the sum of the families notified in each round: 
1 (Ali) + 3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 121.

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy."

Total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * 1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * 1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To determine the total number of water bottles needed, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill already has. 

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time for 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time for 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time for 3 miles on a cold day from the time for 3 miles on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground over 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). 

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 90 - 50
New angle = 40 degrees

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

In total, James will need 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100). The total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his initial $70. He spent $20 + $6 = $26 in total. So, he has $70 - $26 = $44 left.

Since the plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can divide the remaining amount by $2 to find the number of plastic action figures he can buy. $44 / $2 = 22.

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures (4) and plastic action figures (22) to find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week. 4 + 22 = 26.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 26."

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 450 * 1.04 = 468.

However, the recipe calls for 520 degrees. Since the oven is 18 degrees higher than the set temperature, we need to add 18 to the correct set temperature: 468 + 18 = 486.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 486 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies to minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she must have brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 

First, calculate the discount: 
10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10
Discounted price of 1 box = $100 - $10 = $90

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be:
2 * $90 = $180

Now, we need to find the total number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes:
90 contacts / 2 = 45 pairs

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180 / 45 pairs = $4 per pair

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99 * 1500
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01 * 1500
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends, so the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 invited people, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 100 + 200 + 20 = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

The difference in cost between the two platforms is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height once more, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

On the 4th day, the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily protein intake and then multiply it by 7.

Daily protein intake = 200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per 100 grams) = 200 * 0.03 = 6 grams

Weekly protein intake = 6 grams * 7 days = 42 grams

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:
- 8 quarters = 8 * $0.25 = $2
- 6 dimes = 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
- 14 nickels = 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total value of the coins:
$2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
$3.45 / $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 34."
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to first find out how many times it rotates in a month. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it will rotate 725 * 2 = 1450 times per mile. 

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tire will rotate 1450 * 400 = 580,000 times per month.

To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12. 
580,000 * 12 = 6,960,000 times per year.

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it will undergo in a year to find out how many years it will last.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is a common rate in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20.

The total cost of the items with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70. Since Joe can't spend a negative amount, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit.

Joe will be short $6.70.

Final answer: $-6.70"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month was $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it was $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats after removing the seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 16 - 20 = -4. However, this is not possible as the number of functioning lights cannot be negative. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The correct calculation is: 
Total number of street lights = 4 * 4 = 16
Number of non-functioning street lights = 20
Number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
= 16 - 20
Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights, we need to recheck the given data. 

Let's recheck the number of non-functioning street lights. If 20 street lights are not working, it's possible that some intersections have fewer working lights. 

Assuming each intersection has 4 street lights, and 20 are not working, we can recheck the number of intersections with non-functioning lights. 

If 20 street lights are not working, and each intersection has 4 lights, we can divide 20 by 4 to get the number of intersections with non-functioning lights. 
20 / 4 = 5 intersections with non-functioning lights.

Now, let's recalculate the number of functioning street lights:
Total number of intersections = 4
Number of intersections with non-functioning lights = 5
Number of intersections with functioning lights = Total number of intersections - Number of intersections with non-functioning lights
= 4 - 5
= -1

Since we cannot have a negative number of intersections with functioning lights, we need to recheck the given data again.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he chews at school and at home: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum and chews 6 pieces, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Now, subtract the pieces he gave away from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, to find her speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds). 

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's current height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. 

Now, let's subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year.

Now, let's divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years.

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James also got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made a total of $175,000 + $17,500 = $192,500.

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 25 by 0.6:

25 * 0.6 = 15

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from it.

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $600. 

Let's assume he misses x classes. The total cost after missing x classes would be:
$600 - $10x

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we set up the inequality:
$600 - $10x > $10

Simplifying the inequality:
$600 - $10x > $10
-$10x > -$590
x < 59

So, Manny can miss 59 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

The first website publishes 20 articles per day, and the second website publishes 10 articles per day. 

Total articles per day = 20 (political) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is:

Total articles in February = 30 articles per day * 28 days = 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"To find Steve's son's wife's age, we need to break down the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. 

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his classmates.

Howie wants 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

First, we calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 classmates * 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we add the cupcakes for Howie, his teacher, and his classmates: 2 (Howie) + 2 (teacher) + 50 (classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Simplifying the equation:
x + 22000 = 70x

Subtract x from both sides:
22000 = 69x

Divide both sides by 69:
x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial likes, the 2000 likes, and the 20000 new likes:
319 + 2000 + 20000 = 23019

The final answer is 23019."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 (Tuesday) - $540 (Wednesday) = -$142

The difference is -$142, meaning Clara paid $142 less on Tuesday than Sheila paid on Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as 'x'. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, the sales of red hats can be represented as x/2. 

The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats, which is x + x/2. 

Since the sales of red hats were $400, we can set up the equation x/2 = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 800. 

So, the total sales for the first month is 800 + 400 = $1200.

In the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = $900.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account: $200 + $420 = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld is the difference between the total amount in the account and the expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs of renting the hangar and fuel.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly cost of renting the hangar is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hangar for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hangar, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial cost, the cost of renting the hangar, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: 330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each type of nut separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture, the cost is:
- 1/2 pound almonds at $10 per pound = 1/2 * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, the cost is:
- 1/5 pound almonds at $10 per pound = 1/5 * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
$10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and the bottle of soda ($1.00), we get: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

Now, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now that we know the amount of money each person has, we can add them together and divide by 3 to find the amount each person would have if they shared equally:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

Now, we divide the total money by 3 to find the amount each person would have:
Amount each person would have = Total money / 3
Amount each person would have = $360 / 3
Amount each person would have = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that have been recorded so far. 

Christina recorded 8 good days, 8 bad days, and 8 neutral days, making a total of 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days. 

Since there are 30 days in the month, we subtract the 24 days that have been recorded from 30 to find the remaining days: 30 - 24 = 6.

Since the next three days are good, we need to subtract these from the remaining days: 6 - 3 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 good days left in the month.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the target height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 600 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

600 inches / 12 = 50 feet

Now, we know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 50 feet, we can divide the target height in feet by the growth rate in inches per day.

50 feet / 30 inches/day = 50 / 30 days

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.

50 / 10 = 5
30 / 10 = 3

So, the bamboo will take 5 days to reach 50 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs became 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 9 toys. However, he already had 4 toys, so he needs 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 8 (initially bought) + 5 (additional needed) = 13 toys.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the number of lollipops by the cost per lollipop: 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4): 
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: 
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, we multiply the number of months in a year (12) by 10.

12 months/year * 10 years = 120 months

Now, we multiply the number of months by the number of coins Rong saves per month.

120 months * 20 coins/month = 2400 coins

Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we need to find 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings and add it to Rong's monthly savings.

2/5 * 20 coins = 8 coins

Now, we add the extra coins Neil saves to Rong's monthly savings.

20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins

Now, we multiply the number of months by the new monthly savings for both Rong and Neil.

120 months * 28 coins/month = 3360 coins

Now, we add the total coins saved by Rong and Neil.

2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 5760."
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total cost, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.

Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to find the total number of chairs needed.

Total chairs = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there are 57 attendees (42 adults + 15 babies), and Mia already has 48 chairs, we need to find out how many more chairs she needs to get.

Number of additional chairs needed = 57 (total attendees) - 48 (total chairs) = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of grandchildren and then multiply it by 3, and then multiply that result by 3 again.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each with 3 grandchildren, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first find the total number of pencils in the box. 

Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 pencils are missing, the total number of pencils in the box is 20 - 4 = 16.

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Total number of pencils / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially and 7 more friends meeting up, so the total number of people is 12 + 7 = 19.

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Since there are 19 people, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed as follows:

- Total number of drinks = 19 people * 2 drinks/person = 38 drinks
- Total number of snacks = 19 people * 3 snacks/person = 57 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:

- Total cost of drinks = 38 drinks * $2/drink = $76
- Total cost of snacks = 57 snacks * $2/snack = $114

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is the sum of the cost of drinks and snacks:

Total cost = $76 + $114 = $190

The final answer is: $190"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying 3/5 of $100. 

Gerald's share = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% of 40% is greater than 40%. 

Let's recalculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of 40% is 32%, we can set up an equation to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city:

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city by dividing 0.32 by 0.4:

0.32 / 0.4 = 0.8

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 0.8 from 1 (since 100% - 80% = 20%):

1 - 0.8 = 0.2

To convert 0.2 to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.2 * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the city uses 20% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Now, we apply the 10% discount. 10% of $50.00 is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Now, let's calculate the amount saved: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = original price + increase
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = new price * number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes, considering the time her arms were raised and the time they were not.

First, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised. Since her arms were raised for 2 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes, resulting in 2 * 200 = 400 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were not raised. Since her arms were not raised for 3 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes, resulting in 3 * 300 = 900 taps.

Now, we add the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised and when they were not raised to get the total number of taps. 

Total taps = 400 + 900 = 1300

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12, which is 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12, which is 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the extra 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Now, we can find the total number of spools by adding the number of spools of each color. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 

2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

The remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

Then, 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00, which is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 + 2000 = 4000.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day.

First, we multiply the number of days by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day: 30 days * 4 pieces/day = 120 pieces.

Next, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required: 24 / 8 = 3

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is 15 years. 
Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so it is 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together: 
15 (Dora's age) + 38 (father's age) + 34 (mother's age) = 87 years.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know that her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. 

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The weight of her history book is twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B received 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of apples they have after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

After Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

The difference in the number of apples Beck has than Boris now is 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The water left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has.

10 + 6 = 16

So, Alice has 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, 10-gallon jars will cost 10 * $5 = $50.

The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48.

The total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars = $50 + $48 = $98.

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The sum of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music is 10 + 5 + 10 = 25.

To find the number of students who like to play video games, we subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students. 

50 - 25 = 25

Therefore, 25 students like to play video games.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children. 

The cost for 2 adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52.
The cost for 2 children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24.
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children.

The cost for 2 adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28.
The cost for 2 children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20.
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's marbles. 

Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 12 groups, we divide 54 by 12.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

So, we need 5 groups to accommodate all 54 students.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we already have from the total number of groups required.

12 (required groups) - 6 (already have) = 6

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to know the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

The total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from the trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from the trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from the trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:

Cases needed by the first house = 250 / 2
Cases needed by the first house = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house.

Cases needed by the third house = 2 * 125
Cases needed by the third house = 250

The third house needs 250 cases of shingles."

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

However, she also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $65 + $30 = $95.

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we know the cost of the movies in series is $6 each, and the cost of the older movies is $5 each. We also know the cost of a normal movie is $10.

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * 10
= $2000

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the movies in series and the cost of the older movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies
= $2000 + $800
= $2800

The final answer is: $2800"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the time they spent driving. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

We know they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so we can find the distance by multiplying the hiking speed by the time spent hiking: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

However, the question asks for the distance to their vacation spot, which is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. Let's assume Emma jumps on x enemies. Then, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10 * x + 15 and Ava's score is 10 * (x + 8) + 12.

Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower, her time is x + 4 seconds. Ava's time is x seconds.

The time it takes to complete the level is the same for both players, so we can set up the equation:

10 * x + 15 = 30 + 10 * (x + 8)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 = 30 + 10x + 80

Combine like terms:

10x - 10x = 80 - 15
0 = 65

This equation is not solvable, which means we can't find the value of x. However, we can still calculate the difference in scores.

Ava's score is 10 * (x + 8) + 12, and Emma's score is 10 * x + 15. The difference in scores is:

Ava's score - Emma's score = 10 * (x + 8) + 12 - (10 * x + 15)
= 10x + 80 + 12 - 10x - 15
= 77

The difference in scores is 77."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
2 pizzas * 30 dollars/pizza = 60 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 dollars / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. Since he had 4 white fish initially, the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x).

We know that the number of orange fish he has now is 3 - x. Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + 17 - x)
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

So, 39 orange fish were taken out. Now, we can find the number of white fish taken out:

17 - x = 17 - 39 = -22, but again, we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the 17 fish taken out must have included some white fish. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We know that the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x). Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + (17 - x))

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by 0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 by 20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = $200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of $200, we multiply 200 by 3/5.

200 * 3/5 = $120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount she had from the twenties.

$200 - $120 = $80

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the remaining amount she spent from the twenties.

$35 + $80 = $115

Therefore, Carrie paid $115 for lunch.

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost minus the school's contribution: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups: 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back seashells: 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each of these 6 groups had 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by 2 to find the total number of seashells: 6 * 2 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people: 172
People who got off at the first stop: 47
People who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

People who got off at the next stop: 38
Number of people after the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 * 30 = 300

Then, we multiply the result by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 * 0.25 = 75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. So, her special pay for 3 hours is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we can add up the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of female lions + Number of male lions + Number of lion cubs
= 12 + 6 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid to employees after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate 'x':

0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. 
30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car is faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine the total number of candies he has. 

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has now is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he has left is 200 - 150 = 50.

To sell all of his candies, he needs to sell 200 - 50 = 150 more.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is 60."

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used: 
John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows: 
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used) - 3 (dropped) = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 
14 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 7 S'mores.

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he used 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they used 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, resulting in 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8Z + G = 10.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amount of salt, oil, and citrus zest together is 2Z + 4Z + Z = 7Z. 

So, the amount of sugar is G = 10 - 7Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation 7Z + G = 10.

Substituting G = 10 - 7Z into the equation, we get 7Z + 10 - 7Z = 10.

This equation is true for any value of Z, but we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Since the amount of oil is 4Z, we can try different values of Z to find the correct amount of oil.

If Z = 1, then O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4 ounces.

If Z = 2, then O = 4Z = 4(2) = 8 ounces.

If Z = 3, then O = 4Z = 4(3) = 12 ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can try Z = 2, which results in 7Z = 7(2) = 14 ounces, and G = 10 - 14 = -4 ounces, which is not possible.

However, if Z = 1, we get 7Z = 7(1) = 7 ounces, and G = 10 - 7 = 3 ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is 7Z + G = 7(1) + 3 = 10 ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4Z = 4(1) = 4 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half the time she walked on the first day. Half of 8 hours is 4 hours. 

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time.

480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is $129.00. 

For the additional items, Angela needs 2 extra mirrors, 2 extra chandeliers, and 18 extra pictures. The cost of the additional items is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the mirrors, 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers, and 18 * $15.00 = $270.00 for the pictures.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $30.00 + $270.00 = $330.00.

The total cost for Angela is the cost of the standard items plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $330.00 = $459.00.

The final answer is: $459."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. 

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can start by finding the height of the mountain that Saskay can lift. 

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. So, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since the distance remains the same, we can use the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway as the distance.

Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 18 hours / 4
Time = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 3 x 3 = 9 slices from the large apples.

He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 slices from the small apples.

In total, Adam initially had 9 + 15 = 24 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract 15 from 24: 24 - 15 = 9.

There are 9 apple slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find the milk production per cow. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. 

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract the current number of cows from the required number of cows to find out how many more cows he needs.

15 cows - 3 cows = 12 cows

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

12"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

5600"
"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

Total amount paid = 4 * $20 = $80

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks they have together, we add the number of dishes and socks.

60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1615.28."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs purchased:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The average cost per pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90 rooms.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the cleaning time:

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the first three equations into the fifth equation:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

A = S + 2, so S = A - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14

So, I am 16 years old.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need 7 packs of glue sticks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 * 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 
The number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides: 
x = 40 
Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We can subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the number of yellow cars: 
75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes are required.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate first. 

Her hourly rate is $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: 
$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points
For true/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points
For long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 3 = 29 points

The final answer is 29."
"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we need to first calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 300 is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is 180 * 50 = $9000.

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he wants to make. 

$9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Now, we know that Isaias needs to sell the 180 chickens for $11000. To find out how much he bought each chicken for, we divide the total amount he needs to make by the number of chickens he plans to sell.

$11000 / 180 chickens = $61.11 per chicken.

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for $61.11."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2 since they sold an equal number. 

32 total glasses / 2 = 16 glasses per boy

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from Julie's sales.

14 (Julie's sales) - 16 (Micah's sales) = -2

However, since Micah sold more glasses than Julie, the result is negative. This means Julie sold 2 fewer glasses than Micah.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah has the original rope, which is 20 meters long, and it costs $2 per meter, so the total amount she has is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she has: $40 - $30 = $10.

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

10"
"To find the answer, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

So, 8 + x = 3 * 8

8 + x = 24

x = 24 - 8

x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. So, 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since Kelly can't have a negative amount of money, this means she has overspent her budget by $91."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys = 200
Number of toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Number of toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that were successfully arranged. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones were successfully arranged. 

We can calculate the number of successfully arranged microphones as follows:
Total microphones = 50
Percentage of successfully arranged microphones = 80%
Number of successfully arranged microphones = Total microphones * (Percentage of successfully arranged microphones / 100)
= 50 * (80 / 100)
= 50 * 0.8
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of successfully arranged microphones by 2:
Number of pairs = Number of successfully arranged microphones / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

6 birds in the bushes * 2/3 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups.

6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we divide the remaining cookies by 5. 

50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the speed of a thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can express this relationship as:

Whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11 * Thingamabob's speed = 121

To find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob's speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob's speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:

Whirligig's speed = 5 * Thingamabob's speed
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. This includes the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We already know the cost of the salad and the yogurt, so we can subtract those from the total cost to find the cost of the carrots.

$11 (total cost) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we need to divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of one carrot.

$2 / 2 = $1

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x + x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * $6 = $54x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54x.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact amount she made from lemonade sales. We can only express it in terms of 'x'. 

But we can find the value of 'x' by using the information that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since she mowed Joe's lawn x times, and Joe paid her $6 for each time, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for 'x', we get x = 1.

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales: $80 - $54x = $80 - $54(1) = $26.

The final answer is 26."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total hours per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. 
We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3. 
However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 (since Joseph can't have a fraction of a notebook). 

So Joseph had 2 notebooks initially. 

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks. 

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks: 12 - 2 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding Dijana's and Anis's distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

18 - 13 = 5

Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume the pot can fill 4 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 bowls, and there are 7 people, there will be 7 - 4 = 3 bowls of soup left for the children.

Since each child can have one bowl of soup for lunch, each child can have 3 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards. So, 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material are needed for small masks.

For large masks: 8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards. To find the total yards, we can convert 8/3 to a decimal, which is approximately 2.67. So, 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material are needed for large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, we need to find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find out how many red and blue shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing.

For blue shoe boxes: Tim started with 7 blue shoe boxes and used 3, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

For red shoe boxes: Tim started with 9 red shoe boxes and used 1/3 of them. To find 1/3 of 9, we multiply 9 by 1/3, which is 3. So, Tim used 3 red shoe boxes for fishing. 

Now, we subtract the used red shoe boxes from the total number of red shoe boxes: 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is $64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 
Then, we calculate the time for the extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in a 30-day month. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days: 
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance to spend $28, we can divide this amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received. $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop, so the revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each student bought 10 lollipops at $0.5 per lollipop, so the cost per student is 10 * $0.5 = $5. Since there are 30 students, the total cost is 30 * $5 = $150.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit: $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be 5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen on this Friday, but we know he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. Let's assume he's seen 5 movies on this Friday. If he's seen 5 movies on this Friday, he's already spent $10 * 5 = $50. If he's seen 0 movies on this Friday, he's spent $0.

Since we don't know how many movies he's seen on this Friday, let's consider both scenarios.

Scenario 1: He's seen 5 movies on this Friday.
He has $134 left. He can buy 134 / 10 = 13.4 tickets. Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

Scenario 2: He's seen 0 movies on this Friday.
He has $134 left. He can buy 134 / 10 = 13.4 tickets. Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

In both scenarios, Colby can buy 13 tickets."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys before buying bouncy balls: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys before buying bouncy balls: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to find the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 23."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The cost for these additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay with additional hours.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

The fixed charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor charge is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
The parts charge is $60.

The total cost is $40 (fixed charge) + $78.75 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $178.75.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations:

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. 
Then, the points scored by Azibo would be 'x + 10'. 
The points scored by Bahati would be 'x + 20'.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

Now that we know Dinar scored 5 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
Azibo's points = x + 10
Azibo's points = 5 + 10
Azibo's points = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which means he stapled a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. To find the time she was asleep, we need to subtract the start time from the end time.

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours.
12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes.

Total time she was asleep is 2 hours + 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 hours and 55 minutes.

Now, let's convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes. 
7 hours is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.
Adding 55 minutes to that, we get 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

However, we need to subtract the 5 minutes she woke up early to go to the bathroom. So, 475 - 5 = 470 minutes.

The final answer is 470."

"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

The remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these are to her boyfriend, so 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is 600."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

339"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

The total distance traveled by the bird is the sum of the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled in the southern direction. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75. So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, John paid $2100 for all the phones.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since Robert is building a fence around his garden, we need to add the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

The final answer is 100."
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has $14 saved, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more money he needs. 

Remaining cost = Total cost - Amount saved 
Remaining cost = $39 - $14 
Remaining cost = $25

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount. 

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work. 

Number of hours = Remaining cost / Hourly wage 
Number of hours = $25 / $5 
Number of hours = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 * $6 (gingerbread) + 11 * $15 (apple pie) = $60 + $165 = $225
- Sunday: 15 * $6 (gingerbread) + 15 * $15 (apple pie) = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen. However, since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we need to divide 32 by 8 to get the number of bottles.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74.67 plants in the flower bed. However, since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 74 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = 0.5

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp:

90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a difference from the initial temperature. Let's call the initial temperature 'x'. 
Final temperature = x - 14 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so we can set up the equation:
x - 14 degrees = x - 2 degrees

Solving for x is not necessary, as we are asked for the difference. The difference is 14 degrees. 

The final answer is 14."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

Simplifying the equation:
90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides:
15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany combined.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice the average age, H = 2 * 5 = 10. 

Now, we know the ages of Akbar (3), Alessandro (4), and Helene (10). We can find the age of Wilfred by subtracting the sum of the known ages from the total age. 

The sum of the known ages is 3 + 4 + 10 = 17. 

The age of Wilfred is 20 - 17 = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

First, we find the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies.

Then, we divide the total number of cookies by 2 to find out how many cookies were given to the church: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were in the church: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, the total number of slices is 4.

Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time. 
Serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total earnings from the rental and the total earnings from the students.

First, let's calculate the total earnings from the rental:
The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of days the studio is rented in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 days.
The cost to rent the studio per day is $25, so the total cost to rent the studio in a month is 12 * $25 = $300.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the students:
There are 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. Assuming each student attends 3 sessions per week, the total number of sessions per month is 10 * 3 * 4 = 120 sessions.
The total earnings from the students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
The total earnings from the students in a month is 120 * $15 = $1800.

Now, let's add the total earnings from the rental and the total earnings from the students to get the total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month:
$300 (rental) + $1800 (students) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number from Peter's number: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

78"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

Cost = Total gallons x cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = 826

The cost to fill the pool will be $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x + (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x + (0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

Combine like terms:

(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) * x = 0.28

Now, let's calculate the values:

(0.91)^5 = 0.59049
(0.93)^3 = 0.8577
(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) = 0.59049 * 1.8577 = 1.1003

Now, we can solve for x:

1.1003 * x = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 1.1003
x ≈ 0.254

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 25.4%.

The final answer is 25.4."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly income is $400 + $15 * 40 = $400 + $600 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly income of $1000. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year and add it to the previous year's price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 6 portraits.

27"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

The final answer is 36."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by adding the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches.

Now, let's multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches would be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Now, let's add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.1 = 0.7

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first determine the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Now, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move between each bottle.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total length of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move to the last bottle, which is 7 intervals (or spaces) away. It takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle. So, the total time it will take to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds

"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost while in school, we need to consider the income Jim would have earned if he hadn't gone to college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money lost due to not working while in school. Since Jim worked for 4 years, and his annual income was $25,000, the total amount of money lost is:

$25,000 * 4 years = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned while in college. He received $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of money he earned is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

However, his college degree tripled his income, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000. 

The total amount of money he earned after college is:

$75,000 * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he needs to pay back, which is the sum of the money lost while in school and the money he earned while in college:

$100,000 (lost) + $200,000 (earned) = $300,000

Since he earned $300,000 after college, and he needs to pay back $300,000, it will take him 1 year to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter. Since it's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions will be:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 * 80 square feet
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total cost is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12:
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To solve for 'x', we first multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008: 
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009: 
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * Depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,318
= $12,482

Year 2010: 
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * Depreciation rate)
= $12,482 - ($12,482 * 0.21)
= $12,482 - $2,618.82
= $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 - 325
Remaining distance = 1630 kilometers

The answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. 

Area of a single tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt
Total tiles required = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles required by the cost per tile.

Total cost = Total tiles required * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles * $12
Total cost = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a week:

- 4 twin beds * 2 sets of sheets per twin bed = 8 sets of twin sheets per week
- 1 king bed * 1 set of sheets per king bed = 1 set of king sheets per week
- Total sets of sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sets per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year is:
9 sets per week * 52 weeks per year = 468 sets per year

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a year:
- 2 twin sets per load
- 1 king set per load
- Total sets per load = 3 sets per load
- Total loads per year = 468 sets per year / 3 sets per load = 156 loads per year

"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from each year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices each person ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10. 
Solving for x, we get x = 7. 
So Jake ate 7 slices. 
Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices. 

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by each person: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The visit is 30 minutes, which is half of an hour. The doctor charges $300/hour, so the cost of the visit is $300/2 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the cost of the parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 28 - 20 = 8 additional guests. 

The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48. Adding this to the initial fee, the total cost is $125 + $48 = $173."

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

A dozen roses costs $15, and she bought 15 roses, which is 1.25 times a dozen. So, the cost of 15 roses is 1.25 * $15 = $18.75.

Jenny has five $5 bills, which is $25. Subtracting the cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has, we get $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $6.25 by 0.25 to get 25 quarters.

The final answer is 25."

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

The sale price is 75% of the original price, so we can set up the equation: 
75% * original price = $2000
To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form):
original price = $2000 / 0.75
original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. 
120% of $2000 is 1.2 * $2000 = $2400

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100:
discount percentage = ((original price - sale price) / original price) * 100
discount percentage = (($2666.67 - $2400) / $2666.67) * 100
discount percentage = ($266.67 / $2666.67) * 100
discount percentage = 0.1 * 100
discount percentage = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches, which is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount of fence Sam gets from the total length of the fence: 100 - 20 = 80.

"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of MTB price): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 7 days in a week. So, the total minutes in a week is 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of it, the amount they ate is x/2. So, the amount left after the velociraptors ate is x - x/2 = x/2.

We know that the amount left after the velociraptors ate is 270 kilograms, so x/2 = 270. Solving for x, we get x = 540 kilograms.

This means that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. Let's call the initial amount 'y'. Since the T-Rex ate half of it, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is y/2 = 540. Solving for y, we get y = 1080 kilograms.

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00. So, the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This also means that the number of large jellyfish that stay blue is x/5 - 6.

Since the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6*15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given relationships. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age: 4 * 2 = 8.
Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3 to find Caroline's age: 8 * 3 = 24.

Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years. 

The total amount she needs to save is her annual savings multiplied by the number of years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. 

Assuming she has been working for 0 years, she needs to work for 60 years to save for her retirement."

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to first find the total number of boys and then use the percentage to calculate the number of girls.

Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches. 

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. So, the total amount she spent on the books is $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

So, the number of new students this year is 10.

4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total distance for one trip: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance for one trip by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift.

Let's calculate the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

However, since the fifth worker needs to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce 2 toys per hour to meet the demand.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight. Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of his stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

We know the average car goes 120 mph and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car can go 750 mph."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

28"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. Since he has two mugs, and we know one mug is 33 degrees, we can assume the other mug is also 33 degrees for now.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means he now has 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. 

Since he can now drink the water, the total amount of water he has is at least 5 ounces. 

Now, let's assume the second mug is x degrees. We know that the total amount of water in both mugs is at least 5 ounces. 

We can set up an equation to represent this: 4 + 1 + (x/8) = 5, where x/8 represents the amount of water in the second mug.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 5 + x/8 = 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get: x/8 = 0

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get: x = 0

However, this solution doesn't make sense because the second mug would be 0 degrees, which is not possible. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Since the second mug is x degrees, we can set up an equation: 4 + 1 + (x/8) = 40

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals: 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The total cost of the 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. To do this, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels. 

$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to divide 18 scoops by 3 scoops per 3 potatoes. 

18 / 3 = 6.

So, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans."

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons in a year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus: 
(9/14) = x/84, where x is the number of women on the bus.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first calculate the total number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 3: 
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold: 
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his money, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

The cost of 20 rocks is 20 * 5 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.

Now, we subtract the revenue from the cost to find the loss: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16.

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert the total number of eggs to a numerical value. Since a dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the total cost for one fish for the entire month would be 31 days * $1/day = $31.

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all the fish in May would be 3 * $31 = $93.

The final answer is 93."
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the total number of roses she initially had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial roses = 30
Roses given to her mother = 24
Roses bought = 15

Total roses now = Initial roses - Roses given to her mother + Roses bought
Total roses now = 30 - 24 + 15
Total roses now = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning to find the probability that both tickets are winners:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is 3 times the number each person gets. Let's denote the number each person gets as 'y'. Then, the total number of seashells is 3y.

Now, we can set up the equation:

5x + 5 = 3y

We also know that the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person, so we can write another equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 3y

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = 3y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

First, let's solve for x in terms of y from the first equation:

5x + 5 = 3y
5x = 3y - 5
x = (3y - 5) / 5

Now, substitute x in the second equation:

5((3y - 5) / 5) + 5 = 3y

Simplify the equation:

3y - 5 + 5 = 3y

This equation is true for any value of y, so we need to find another way to solve for y.

We know that the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 3y
5x + 5 = 3y

Now, we can substitute x in terms of y:

5((3y - 5) / 5) + 5 = 3y

Simplify the equation:

3y - 5 + 5 = 3y

This equation is true for any value of y, so we need to find another way to solve for y.

Let's go back to the original problem and try a different approach. We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, and Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, we can write:

Jim's seashells = Carlos' seashells + 5
Jim's seashells = 2x + 5
2x + 5 = 2x + 5

This equation is true for any value of x, so we need to find another way to solve for x.

Let's try to find the total number of seashells in terms of x. We know that the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells
5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Now, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find the number each person gets:

(5x + 5) / 3 = y

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can write:

2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number each person gets:

y = (5x + 5) / 3
y = (5(11) + 5) / 3
y = (55 + 5) / 3
y = 60 / 3
y = 20

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells. They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per day

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

460 bottles (required) - 4200 (available) = -2740 bottles

However, since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total energy demand in terms of the number of bottles.

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per day

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of days needed to meet the energy demand as follows:

460 bottles / 4200 bottles per day = 0.109 days

Since we want to know how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the energy demand, we can multiply the number of days by the number of bottles produced per day:

0.109 days * 4200 bottles per day = 460.8 bottles

Since we can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number.

460.8 bottles → 461 bottles

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 461 more bottles to meet the energy demand of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 461"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2/3 (blue) = 8/3.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 8) * 100 = 75%

The final answer is 75."

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold another 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the length of the blue rope as B, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: 4B + B + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 5B + Y = 37.

Now substitute the second equation into the previous equation: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Expand the equation: 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Initially, Ronnie had $5. After giving $3 to her sister, Ronnie is left with:

5 - 3 = 2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are four colors of paint and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, let's denote the amount of each color as x. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided among the other three colors. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x. The total amount of paint used for the other half is 2x (x for red, x for white, and x for purple). 

The total amount of paint used for the entire mural is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 2x = 12. 

Combine like terms: 5x = 12. 

Divide both sides by 5: x = 12/5. 

x = 2.4. 

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is x, which is 2.4 pints.

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs $12. We want to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. 

To do this, we can divide the total cost of the new box ($12) by the cost per cycle ($1) and then divide the number of pods in the new box (120) by the number of pods per cycle (1).

Number of cycles = Total cost / Cost per cycle
= $12 / $1
= 12 cycles

However, we also need to consider the number of pods in the new box. 

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Number of pods per cycle
= 120 / 1
= 120 cycles

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we can run 120 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left. 

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the remaining chalk to be smaller than 2 inches, we can divide the remaining chalk by 20% (or 0.2).

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. 

The teacher will have 13 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total refund amount.

The cost of milk per gallon is $3.5. 

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * 3.5
Refund amount = 5600

The final answer is: 5600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

$500 ÷ 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

$27,000 ÷ $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the money among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5,400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is 1,800."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. He put 1 in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Then, he picked up these 7 apples, put all but 1 in his pocket and threw the remaining 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The total miles Sam ran this week is 19."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from John's current age. 

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can represent Jim's age as x. Then, John's age would be 2x. 

We know John's current age is 28, so we can set up the equation 2x = 28. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

14"
"To find out how many slices of apple they all ate, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by each person.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate 6 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. 

The length of May's hair decreased by 2 inches, so the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance bonus.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus = $270 + $40 = $310

The final answer is: $310"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply the frequency of each task by its respective payment and then add them together.

For emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00

For taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
For cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add the earnings together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in two weeks."
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

40 gallons (whale's blood) * 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

The total amount of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 

So, the total number of people at this point is 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 more people entered. 

The total number of people at this point is 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

The number of black pens is twice the number of red pens, so the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400."
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract 22 from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation should be: 
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house's height after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this still doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation again.

The correct calculation should be:
The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
The height of the second floor is the remaining part of the house's height after subtracting the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since the height of the second floor is 240 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop.

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's calculate the number of people who entered at the second station. Since 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first stop entered the bus at the second station, we need to find 3/4 of 40.

3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30

Total number of people after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

Since the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, we need to multiply the current number of people by 2.

Number of people after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity.

Remaining spaces = 200 - 180 = 20

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since there are 3 grades (4-7), the total number of students is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 30 / 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't use the full 45 minutes, we'll assume they'll use the remaining time in the next group. 

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds needed by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is $4 + $4 = $8.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday and then add 1 inch.

Monday's rain: 2 inches
Twice of Monday's rain: 2 * 2 = 4 inches
Tuesday's rain: 4 + 1 = 5 inches

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of the nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. Since Karen is getting both, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services.

First, calculate the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues she receives from each magazine and add them together.

The first magazine sends 12 issues a year. 
The second magazine sends 6 issues a year. 
The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all three magazines: 
12 + 6 + 24 = 42

So, Susan gets 42 magazines every year.

42"
"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, we need to find 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to calculate 3/4 of the original amount, since she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos.

Let's calculate 3/4 of 20:
3/4 * 20 = (3 * 20) / 4
= 60 / 4
= 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

15"
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. The remaining number of apples is 60 - 24 = 36.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. The remaining number of apples is 36 - 9 = 27.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

9 * 4 = 36

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, he traveled for 3 days, which is 72 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (Distance / Total Distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick to the number of substitute teachers.

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

The final answer is: 22"
"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese separately and then add them together.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the sum of the books on all shelves should equal 110.

The equation can be written as: B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms: 1.5B - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides: 1.5B = 115

Divide both sides by 1.5: B = 77

Now that we know the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, we can find the number of books on the middle shelf: B/2 = 77/2 = 38.5

Since we can't have half a book, we'll round down to 38 books on the middle shelf.

The top shelf can hold 77 - 5 = 72 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books on the shelves: 38 + 77 + 72 = 187

However, we know that Elly has 110 books. This means we need to recalculate the number of books on each shelf.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 77/2 = 38.5 books. We'll round down to 38 books.

The top shelf can hold 77 - 5 = 72 books.

The total number of books on the shelves is 77 + 38 + 72 = 187. Since we know Elly has 110 books, we need to recalculate the number of books on each shelf.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 72 books.

Let's try again. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 72 books.

Since the total number of books is 110, we can see that the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books.

Now, let's calculate the number of bookcases needed. Each bookcase has 3 shelves. Since the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books, we can see that 3 bookcases can hold 77 + 38 + 38 = 153 books.

Since 153 is less than 110, we need more bookcases. We can add one more bookcase to hold the remaining 110 - 153 = -43 books. However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of books.

Let's recalculate the number of books on each shelf. The bottom shelf can hold 77 books. The middle shelf can hold 38 books. The top shelf can hold 38 books.

Since the total number of books is 110, we can see that the bottom shelf can hold 77 books, the middle shelf can hold 38 books, and the top shelf can hold 38 books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue. Rose will sell each egg for $1, and she has 60 eggs (5 dozen). So, the total revenue is:

60 * $1 = $60

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats from the remaining hats. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the first test:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test:

Questions needed in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions needed in the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed in the second test = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this as an equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5s - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4
Points scored per game: 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up one of the marbles and found it to be a bead, so he got rid of it. Therefore, he was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

First, let's calculate the number of small candles: 
4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles

Next, let's calculate the number of medium candles: 
4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 
16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people in the house. 
4 people * 2 flashlights per person = 8 flashlights

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights: 
36 candles + 8 flashlights = 44

The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 44."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week:
24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants require a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8.

Since each of these 8 plants requires a quarter of a cup of water, we multiply 8 by 0.25: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the water part: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00.

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

Therefore, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages:

Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4500 words / 0.16 words per second
Time = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60
Time (minutes) = 4.69 minutes

The final answer is: 4.69"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows: 1 cup / 0.5 cup = 2 lemons per gallon.

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons needed would be 5 * 2 = 10 lemons.

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups as follows: 2 cups / 0.5 cup = 4 lemons.

Now, we add the lemons needed for the main 5 gallons and the extra gallon: 10 lemons + 4 lemons = 14 lemons.

"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies. 

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

There are 43 pink candies."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find the age of Emma. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 = 40 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

40 - 5 = 35

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

We know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height. 

Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $8 + $24 = $32.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases:

- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 10 * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds. 
The cost of honey for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The total cost is 20 pounds * $6 per pound + 15 pounds * $8 per pound + 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $500 - $440 = $60.

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * 4 = $144.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total, leaving him with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 28 by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2)."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance, which is 2 miles. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, her speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Vanessa to run 4 miles. Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is 64."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 40 - 2b + 4b = 70, which simplifies to 2b = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into c = 20 - b, which gives us c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
