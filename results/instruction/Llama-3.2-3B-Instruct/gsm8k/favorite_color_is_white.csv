"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll round down to 3 muffins).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The total number of bolts required is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

The profit is the new value minus the original price: $200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000.

The profit Josh made is $120,000.

120,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance covered in a week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, we need to find out how much feed she needs for the final meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + Feed needed for the final meal

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, we can calculate the total feed needed for the final meal by multiplying the number of chickens by 3.

Feed needed for the final meal = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups

Now, we can calculate the total feed needed for the day.

Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + 60 cups
Total feed needed for the day = 860 cups

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we need to add up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home. Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

So, John is 355 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. 

To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial investment. We need to consider the revenue generated in the 12th year, which will be $10.5. 

So, the correct answer is 12 years."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

-2x/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

-2x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by -3/2:

x = 9

So, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is greater than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To determine the distance covered by each train, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can simply add the distances covered by both trains, which is 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we can add the distances covered by both trains, which is 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, to find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered in both directions. Since they traveled the same distance in both directions, we can simply add the total distances covered in each direction. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is 160 (westward) + 300 (northward) = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching is 50 weeks * $20/hour = $1000.

Her annual salary from coaching is 50 weeks * 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $2250.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $1000 + $2250 = $3250.

The final answer is: $3250."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 * 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Required speed = Total distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

Initially, the orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The total volume of the mixture after spilling is 10 liters (orange drink) + 15 liters (pineapple drink) - 1 liter (spilled) = 24 liters.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 16 liters.

"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age:

Age difference = Raymond's age - son's age
Age difference = 25 - 23
Age difference = 2

Since we want to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age difference from the current year. However, the current year is not provided. Assuming the current year is the same as Samantha's age (31), we can calculate the years that have passed since Raymond's son was born:

Years since birth = Current year - son's age
Years since birth = 31 - 23
Years since birth = 8

However, since Raymond was 23 when his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from the years since birth to find the correct answer:

Years since birth = Years since birth - Raymond's age at son's birth
Years since birth = 8 - 23
Years since birth = -15

Since we cannot have a negative number of years, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. The correct approach is to find the age difference between Raymond and his son, and then subtract that from the current year to find the years since Raymond's son was born.

Age difference = Raymond's age - son's age
Age difference = 25 - 23
Age difference = 2

Now, we subtract the age difference from the current year (Samantha's age) to find the years since Raymond's son was born:

Years since birth = Samantha's age - Age difference
Years since birth = 31 - 2
Years since birth = 29

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she buys in 60 days and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

There are 15 servings per carton, so the number of cartons she needs is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 25 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * 15 = $195.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 * 20 = $160.

He has $5 left after buying the video games. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount he earned: 195 - 160 = $35.

Since he has $35 left, we can set up an equation to find out how many Lego sets he still has: 35 = 15x, where x is the number of Lego sets he still has.

Dividing both sides by 15, we get x = 35 / 15 = 2.33.

Since John can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John still has 2 Lego sets."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, his weekly running distance is 6 miles.

To find his average speed, we need to know the total distance he runs in a year. Assuming a non-leap year (365 days), his total yearly distance would be 6 miles/day * 365 days = 2190 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 2190 miles / 2190 hours (since 60 miles/week * 37 weeks = 2190 hours)
Average speed = 1 mile/hour

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance traveled while walking is 3 miles per hour * 4 hours = 12 miles.

The total distance traveled is 12 miles (running) + 12 miles (walking) = 24 miles.

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find the number of servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 * 300 = 240g.

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles. The cost of beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds is $10.00. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used and the ones she had left.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used and the ones she had left: 220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243.

Now, we subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total to find the number of Post-it notes in the package: 243 (total) - 80 (initial) = 163.

The package she purchased contained 163 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Total number of floors = 15
Number of occupied floors = 3/4 * 15 = 11.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a floor, we'll round down to 11 occupied floors.

Number of units per floor = 8
Total number of occupied units = 11 * 8 = 88

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Total number of units = 15 * 8 = 120
Total number of unoccupied units = 120 - 88 = 32

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we can find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. The total number of kittens is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000. This is the annual pension for the remaining 10 years.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = 840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.
10% of 140 is 0.1 * 140 = 14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = 126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = 756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount she paid for the entire year:
840 + 756 = 1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596."
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The total capacity of her tank is 12 gallons. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, the remaining amount of gas in the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

We also know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to divide the remaining amount of gas (8 gallons) by the miles she has already traveled (100 miles).

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Total gallons
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 8 gallons
Miles per gallon = 12.5 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams/school * 5 players/team = 10 players/school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach for each team, so the total number of coaches is 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does. 

Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is 'x + 8', we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% annual increase for each year.

Initial salary: $600
Year 1 increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Year 1 salary: $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2 increase: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Year 2 salary: $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3 increase: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Year 3 salary: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4 increase: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Year 4 salary: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5 increase: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Year 5 salary: $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Since Sylvie has already clocked 5 years in the company, we can stop here. Her annual salary after three more years of service is $966.31.

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 10 * 20 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

28"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed would be G - 2. 

We know that Lee's speed is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: G - 2 = 38. Solving for G, we get G = 40.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed was 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement, his new speed would be 40 + (40 * 0.1) = 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes. 

So, the original volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces. Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the original volume by the volume of each can to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25.

Solving for x, we get x = 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

She currently has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she currently has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for all friends: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the remaining pages by 4:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we first need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of them on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because we know Frankie watched some TV on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. That's 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's re-evaluate the time spent watching TV on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. We know that the total time spent watching TV on Wednesday is the difference between the total time and the time spent watching TV on other days. However, we can't directly calculate the time spent watching TV on Wednesday because we don't know the exact number of episodes.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. That's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The boat took on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. We can set up an equation:

300 = 50x

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price is 10 * $15 + 5 * $24 = $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total amount of sugar used.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $55,769 (approximately)

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $55,769
= $128,569

The final answer is: $128,569"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Total hours spent on patients per day = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients per day - Total cost of doctors' time per day
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000
Profit per day = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 per day in profit."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

The remaining elves are 60 - 20 = 40.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

The number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final cost of the order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to get:
2B + B + Q = 700
Combine like terms: 3B + Q = 700

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
Expand and simplify: 6Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms: 7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the non-food items and then add the cost of the food items.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

Since there is a 10% tax on these items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars. 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. 

So, the total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The total cost of everything is 11 + 5 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Now, we can calculate Kim's profit by subtracting his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate the number of harvests in a year:
12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny needs to pick up 2125 legos.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

Now, two times as many bees as initially left (30) leave the hive in the next 6 hours, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

However, these bees are the ones that initially left and hadn't returned yet. So, we need to add them to the total number of bees that have returned so far. 

The total number of bees that have returned so far is 45 + 60 = 105 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, and 30 bees left initially, 60 - 30 = 30 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, let's calculate the price after 2 months:
Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Next, we'll calculate the price after 4 months:
Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We'll continue this pattern for 36 months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can multiply the price after 2 months by 2^18 (2^18 = 262,144).

Price after 36 months = $28.80 * 2^18

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we first need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation to find the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. The equation would be:

$10 (revenue per gallon) * number of gallons = $25 (profit) + C (total cost)

However, we don't know the number of gallons yet. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Let's denote the number of gallons as G. The total cost is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar, which is $5 * G.

Now we have two equations:

$10 * G = $25 + C
$5 * G = C

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:

$10 * G = $25 + $5 * G

Subtracting $5 * G from both sides:

$5 * G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5:

G = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost:

C = $5 * G
C = $5 * 5
C = $25

Since the total cost is $25, and the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, the amount spent on lemons is:

$3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to first determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese participants and a total of 240 participants. 

The number of Chinese participants is the difference between the total number of participants and the number of Japanese participants. 

Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far: 
1500 + 2000 = 3500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity, so we need to find the remaining amount after the donation:
6000 - 3500 = 2500

He then gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount:
2500 - 200 = 2300
2300 - 700 = 1600

Therefore, Zaid will have 1600$ left after all these expenses and donations.

1600"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has. 

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, we add the earnings for both weeks to find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then the number of red roses. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation: 
5 * white carnations = 200
white carnations = 200 / 5
white carnations = 40

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can set up the equation:
red roses = 4 * white carnations
red roses = 4 * 40
red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

Now that we know Mark's current age, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation: J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 legs, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, their times are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0) * 100 = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding Jenna's and her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used by the rabbits from the total straw used. 

Total straw used among small rodents = Total straw used - Straw used by rabbits
Total straw used among small rodents = 160 - 20
Total straw used among small rodents = 140

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'x'. The total number of rats is 3x.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used by rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total straw used among small rodents is 140, so we can set up the equation:

18x = 140

To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide both sides by 18:

x = 140 / 18
x = 7.78 (round down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a rat)

So, there are 7 rats in each cage.

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the debt after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.

Total interest = Interest for one month * Number of months
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we can find the total number of bags transported by dividing the total transportation cost by the cost per bag:
Total bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Total bags transported = $140 / $2
Total bags transported = 70

Since the trader bought the bags, the number of bags sold is the difference between the total bags transported and the total number of bags bought:
Number of bags sold = Total bags transported - Total bags bought
Number of bags sold = 70 - 13
Number of bags sold = 57

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost for the entire trip = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost for the entire trip = $36.00 + $66
Total cost for the entire trip = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost for the entire trip / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, now there are 18 - 6 + 6 = 18 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos. Now, there are 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. 

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots in total, we can find the pounds of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the pounds to be distributed from the total.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Pounds of carrots to be distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120 pounds

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the required total score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and then subtract the amount she already has saved.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + $20 (first pair of shoes) + $20 (second pair of shoes) = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so we subtract that from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, we need to find out how many times she needs to earn $60 by babysitting. Since she earns $5 per babysitting session, we divide the amount she needs ($60) by the amount she earns per session ($5): $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Sara needs to babysit 12 times to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express this as w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round down to 133 customers on the first day. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day:

Second day = 133 + 50 = 183

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day:

Third day = 500 - (133 + 183) = 500 - 316 = 184

The final answer is 184."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. Since the small pool now has y gallons, we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y:

y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she will return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 (Naomi) - 44 (Yuri) - 85 (Brianna) = 54 points.

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100: (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 48%.

"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. The remaining melons would be 120 - 36 = 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

"To find the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the initial number of apps and then add the number of new apps he downloaded.

Initial number of apps: 61
Number of apps deleted: 9
Number of new apps downloaded: 18

Current number of apps = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted + Number of new apps downloaded
= 61 - 9 + 18

The current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars last night. 

So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves he killed is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves last night and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves.

Total number of animals killed = 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) + 12 (cougars) + 36 (wolves) = 73.

The final answer is 73."
"To find the floor Bill is on now, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows were added to each stall. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 20 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in 8 stalls. 

The number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * (20 + 2) = 8 * 22 = 176 cows.

"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

The value of the coins is as follows:
- 100 pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2

The total value of the coins is $1 + $2 + $2 = $5.

The value of the dollar bills is 40 * $1 = $40.

Adding the value of the coins and the dollar bills, we get $5 + $40 = $45.

Therefore, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate. 

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% expressed as a decimal). 

Weight of eaten wood = 400 pounds * 0.3 = 120 pounds

Now, we need to find the weight of the remaining wood. Since the total weight of the redwood is the weight of the eaten wood plus the weight of the remaining wood, we can subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight.

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight - Weight of eaten wood
Weight of remaining wood = 400 pounds - 120 pounds
Weight of remaining wood = 280 pounds

Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the height by the weight per section.

Total weight = Height * Weight per section
Total weight = 200 feet * 400 pounds/10 feet
Total weight = 800 pounds

However, this is the total weight of the redwood, not the weight of the remaining wood. To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of the eaten wood to the weight of the remaining wood.

Total weight = Weight of remaining wood + Weight of eaten wood
Total weight = 280 pounds + 120 pounds
Total weight = 400 pounds

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to first calculate the cost of the overdue books and then add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she owes a flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount she owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
= 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
= 128

The final answer is 128."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is 62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she initially had to the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she had 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. 

Now, we add the marbles she initially had to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Maddison now has 270 marbles.

"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money the girls have combined is $400."
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid: 
Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Loan amount 
= $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 
= $282,000

Now, let's calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house: 
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid

"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater. 
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The number of stitches for each sleeve is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. Then, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A: 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Next, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. Then, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. The number of cards with the letter D is the remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter C: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots is (40 * 70) + (60 * 35) = 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests per team member: 2
Total number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24
Total number of people: 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be: 13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches. 

Now, subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used. 

17 / 0.25 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to first find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories. 
In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories. 
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each person in both weeks. 
Alani's total stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total stories: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360."

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of her quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of her dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of her quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to get the number of 5-star rows, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children = 16 / 8 = 2 bars"
"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we can multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is 83."

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so her bids would be: $250, $300, $350.

Since Carmen wins after the third bid, the final cost of the desk is $400."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1,800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1,800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss.

Weekly weight loss for Joey = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight lost by Sandy's weekly weight loss.

Number of weeks for Sandy = Total weight lost / Sandy's weekly weight loss
Number of weeks for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = 4 weeks

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Cera was half as old as Noah six years ago, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that the current population of Chile is 2P. We can set up the equation:

2P = current population of Chile

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the first equation into the second equation:

2(3000(N - 6)) = current population of Chile

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6000(N - 6) = current population of Chile

Now we can substitute C = 46 into the equation N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6):

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we have found N, we can find the current population of Chile:

6000(N - 6) = 6000(26 - 6)
6000(20) = current population of Chile
120000 = current population of Chile

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

Since x represents the number of electric poles, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's represent the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 + 46 = 26.

Now, let's solve for x: 
3x + 48 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month:

Total amount for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month:

Total amount for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = Total amount for junior programmers + Total amount for senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After eating 3 more lollipops that night, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which represents the number of ruined castles, and then divide that number by 2, since half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

First, calculate 40% of 220:
40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Then, divide the result by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100."
"To find out how many guns they would have if they were to share them equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people, so to share the guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by 4.

24 / 4 = 6

So, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar required for each type of candy separately and then add them together.

For suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces
For fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (suckers) + 70 ounces (fudge) = 310 ounces

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
Value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
Value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:
8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c'. 

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: c + 2c = 60. 

Combine like terms: 3c = 60. 

Divide both sides by 3: c = 20. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2c = 2 * 20 = 40. 

The total number of legs is the sum of the legs of all the animals. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. 

Total legs = (4 * 20) + (2 * 40) = 80 + 80 = 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we need to consider the number of balls he started with and the number he added each week. 

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

3 (initial balls) + 1 (first week) + 1 (second week) + 1 (third week) + 1 (fourth week) = 7

However, Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

7 (total balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel initially received 24 outfits from her friend.
At the baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 more outfits.

Now, let's add all the outfits together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

Laurel now has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To find the total distance covered in June, we need to calculate the daily distance after the coach's advice and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first determine the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

The tables with 4 legs have 40 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 40 * 4 = 160.

The tables with 3 legs have 50 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 50 * 3 = 150.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

9"
"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

36"
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= (100 / 1000) * 100
= 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total monthly expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the weekly expenditure and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly expenditure on food = $25
Weekly expenditure on treats = $20 * 4 = $80
Weekly expenditure on medicine = $100 / 4 = $25

Total weekly expenditure = $25 + $80 + $25 = $130

Total monthly expenditure = $130 * 4 = $520

Total yearly expenditure = $520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: 6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

"To determine the total number of plant pots April needs, we first need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

The total number of pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 pots.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, the number of pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10 pots.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5.
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20.
- Arcade tokens cost $5.

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will have $5 for arcade tokens, we need to divide the remaining budget by $5 to find out how many friends Morgan can invite:
$60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, let's convert the daily pocket money to cents: $5 = 500 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lollipops: 4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from the daily pocket money: 500 cents - 100 cents = 400 cents.

Since Marisa saves this amount for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: 400 cents * 5 = 2000 cents.

Now, let's convert the total savings back to dollars: 2000 cents = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs and $2 on gumballs, so he had $10 - $8 = $2 left. This $2 is his remaining change, which he must have used to buy candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the remaining $2 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

1.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = S
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services every 20 days."
"To determine the amount of stuffing needed, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 

For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken for the detour = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to come back home
Total time = 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5), the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10), and the number of people kicked out for physical violence (3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30).

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find Erin's initial score, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before Erin scored 14 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote Sara's initial score as x. 
Erin's score after scoring 14 points is 3 times Sara's initial score, so Erin's score is 3x + 14. 
Since Erin's final score is 14, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 14 = 14

Now, we can solve for x: 
3x = 0
x = 0

This means Sara had 0 points initially. 

Since Erin scored 14 points, we can find Erin's initial score by subtracting 14 from Erin's final score: 
Erin's initial score = 14 - 14 = 0

The final answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors will receive cords.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132
- Total cost for senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan is making his own, he will save 20% on the materials cost. 

Let's assume the cost of the materials is x. Then, 20% of x is 0.2x. 

The total cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is the sum of the cost of the materials and the cost of the labor. Since the labor cost is not provided, we can assume it's the same as the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper, which is $400. 

So, the equation becomes: x + 400 = 400 - 0.2x

Combine like terms: 1.2x = 0

Divide both sides by 1.2: x = 0

This means the cost of the materials is $0. Since the cost of the materials is $0, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $0 + $400 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours from each day. 

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 40% of x, which is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

Total amount spent = Number of functioning pieces * Price per piece
400,000 = (x - 0.4x) * Price per piece

Since we don't know the price per piece, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by x:

400,000 / x = 0.6 * Price per piece

However, we still need to find the total number of functioning pieces. We can do this by subtracting the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = x - 0.4x
= 0.6x

Now, we can substitute this expression into the previous equation:

400,000 / 0.6x = Price per piece

To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we can multiply the number of functioning pieces by the price per piece:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Price per piece
= 0.6x * (400,000 / 0.6x)
= 400,000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $400,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as follows:

40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who do not like blue. This is the remaining half of the class:

40 - 20 = 20 pupils do not like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we can calculate this as follows:

20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Now, we subtract the pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow:

20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies initially: 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away: 65 + 44 = 109

Now, let's subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 109 = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

-44"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for calculating monthly interest is: 
Monthly interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 12

Given values: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Monthly interest = (3650 * 0.10 * 5) / 12
Monthly interest = 146.88

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we add the monthly interest to the principal amount to get the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Principal + Monthly interest
Monthly payment = 3650 + 146.88
Monthly payment = 3796.88

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3796.88."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To determine the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade will be 36 cups * $1 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies.

The profit from selling all the lemonade is the total revenue minus the total cost of supplies, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x: 
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts

Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts: 165 / 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio:
- Betty's popsicles: 15 * 5 = 75
- Sam's popsicles: 15 * 6 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the savings, we need to first find the cost of the bundled services. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 * 2 = $20. Since Tim gets a 20% discount, the cost of the bundled services will be 80% of $20, which is 0.8 * $20 = $16.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10, and the cost of the bundled services is $16, so the total cost is $10 + $16 = $26.

The original cost of the cable package was $60. To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the original cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2142857 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 21.42857%

The final answer is 21.43."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch.

For the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe:
- Flour: 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups
- Milk: 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new daily usage: 
7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy saved in 30 days: 
4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135,000 watts

Converting this to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. 

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog):
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Since 1% of the defective candles will explode, we find 1% of 2500:
1% of 2500 = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 60 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + A = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

A = 410

So, Joanne gathered 410 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 410"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 6 days:
Total distance = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to this total.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 km every day for 7 days:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the second week to the total distance:
Total distance = 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total capital = Initial capital + Amount received from the first bank + Amount received from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $14,000

The final answer is: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

There were 12 cats left on the rock.

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: 424"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole saved a total of $6 from both jeans. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is (1/3)x. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of the savings, came from the tattered jeans. This amount is equal to the difference in price between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, which is (x + 6) - x = 6.

We can set up the equation: (2/3)x = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us x = 9.

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $9, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans, which is x + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15.

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 15 - 9 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The 6 minibusses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The 10 minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we can still solve for x.

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 30

This equation is true, which means that x can be any value. However, we can still find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders.

Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10). We know that the store-bought feeders attract 3x birds. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 6x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 10

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders:

3(x + 10) = 3(10 + 10) = 3(20) = 60

The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x = 3(10) = 30.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders:

60 + 30 = 90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he sells 2/3 of the cards, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

Since he gets $1 from selling 2/3 of the cards, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * $1.5 = $1
2/3 * x = 3
x = 3 * 3/2
x = 4.5

However, since we can't have a fraction of a card, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which equals 7. 

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Charlotte needs to pay. 
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. 

So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8.

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents.

Now, we can subtract the amount of money he had left from the amount he had after buying chips to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many he bought. 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 3*20 + 4*20 = 100 beads.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of beads each sister has. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 100 - 40 = 60.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it's on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Total hay = Distance * 0.5
Total hay = 16 * 0.5
Total hay = 8 bails

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * $3
Total cost = 8 * $3
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the price of a popcorn as P and the price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

We also know that you didn't buy the super ticket, so the total cost of the movie ticket and the snacks is $21.

We know that the price of the soda is $3, and you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the cost of the movie ticket and the snacks without the soda is $21 - $2 = $19.

Since you can buy a movie ticket for $12, the cost of the snacks without the soda is $19 - $12 = $7.

Now, we know that the cost of the soda is $3, and the cost of the snacks without the soda is $7. So, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 45. This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Now, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost by 170: 65 * 170 = 11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, half of those fairies (50 / 2 = 25) flew in from the east, so the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75.

After 10 minutes, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week. 

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents
Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. 

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. 

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's money and add it to Ali's initial amount.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9.

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = 100 - 180 = -80

Since Fireman Frank can't have a negative number of shoes, this means he will have 0 shoes on Sunday.

"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. 

Since Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans she needs: 48 / 12 = 4.

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                    = 1/3 * 240
                                    = 80

Therefore, there are 80 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can solve for total_students in the equation 1/4 * total_students = 20.

Multiply both sides by 4 to get total_students = 20 * 4 = 80.

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To determine the daily walking time, we need to divide the total walking time by the number of days available. 

First, we need to convert the total walking time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

Now, we can divide the total walking time in hours by the number of days available. Jason has 3 weeks, which is equal to 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

So, the daily walking time is 4 hours / 21 days = 0.19048 hours per day.

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60. 0.19048 * 60 = 11.4296 minutes per day.

The final answer is 11.43."
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book to find the total number of books:

$300 / $15 = 20 books

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4:

20 books / 4 kids = 5 books per child

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we need to subtract those to avoid double-counting. 

The total number of kids allergic to at least one substance is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class (32) to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel for 3 days. 

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive for a busy weekend, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 

The price of the hotel for 3 days is $1500 + $300 = $1800. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel. 

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. 

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 + $1800 = $11,800.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the cost per orange.
24 * 10 = 240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this consumption. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 

To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

"To determine the number of guests required for both venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The total cost for the first venue is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The total cost for the second venue is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

To find the point at which both venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can express the number of insects David found as B/2.

Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found can be expressed as B/2 + 7.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David's insects = B/2 = 24/2 = 12

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily's insects = B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this makes the couch 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber, as it provides more sticks per dollar. 

He can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of lumber for $24, as 4 * $6 = $24. This will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is 1600."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed.

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs
24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs

Now, we can multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost.

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To calculate the weekly cost of bus trips without a pass, we need to multiply the cost of a single trip by the number of trips per week. 

Cost per trip = $2.20
Trips per week = 5
Weekly cost without pass = Cost per trip * Trips per week
Weekly cost without pass = $2.20 * 5
Weekly cost without pass = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost with the pass:
Weekly cost with pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the weekly cost with the pass from the weekly cost without the pass:
Savings = Weekly cost without pass - Weekly cost with pass
Savings = $11.00 - $20
Savings = -$9.00

Since we can't have a negative savings, it means that buying a weekly bus pass would actually cost Janet $9 more than not buying one."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of items Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

There are 30 days in a month, so 8 months is 8 * 30 = 240 days. Adding the remaining 20 days, he has a total of 240 + 20 = 260 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 260 days ≈ 404 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 404 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance is 0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km.

Since Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer, she will need 60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot, which is x + 3x = 4x. 

Given that the total cost is $120,000, we can set up the equation 4x = 120,000. Solving for x, we get x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000. 

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

"To find the total cost of the canvas bags, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
$64 - $32 = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total fight time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has initially, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total amount of money Ali has initially is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80.
The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first find the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we can set up an equation:

Time taken by Royce = 2 * Time taken by Rob + 40

Substituting the value of Time taken by Rob, we get:

Time taken by Royce = 2 * 120 + 40
Time taken by Royce = 240 + 40
Time taken by Royce = 280 minutes

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and then multiply each item by the number of skeins required.

For each triplet, Martha needs:
- 1 hat: 2 skeins
- 1 scarf: 4 skeins
- 1 sweater: 12 skeins
- 1 pair of mittens: 1 pair = 2 skeins
- 1 pair of socks: 2 skeins

Total items per triplet: 2 + 4 + 12 + 2 + 2 = 22 items

Since there are 3 triplets, the total number of items needed is 22 * 3 = 66 items.

Now, we multiply the total number of items by the number of skeins required for each item:
66 items * 2 skeins (hat) = 132 skeins
66 items * 4 skeins (scarf) = 264 skeins
66 items * 12 skeins (sweater) = 792 skeins
66 items * 2 skeins (mittens) = 132 skeins
66 items * 2 skeins (socks) = 132 skeins

Total skeins needed: 132 + 264 + 792 + 132 + 132 = 1310 skeins

Martha will need 1310 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. Since there were 100 problems in total, one-quarter of 100 is 25. 

The total number of problems completed so far is 48 + 25 = 73.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 73 = 27.

Chris has 27 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29."

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we need to add the number of rows for each color of tulips. However, we can't plant a fraction of a row, so we need to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller number of rows.

6 (red tulips) is greater than 3 (blue tulips), so we can plant 3 rows of flowers.

"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Now, we need to find the rate at which 5 people paint the house. Since the rate is additive, we can multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs, which is 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we need to first determine how much he spent on the headphone set. 

We know Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

$44 (cost of headphone set) / $4 (cost of CD) = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since he didn't work out 4 hours for 2 weeks). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked out 5 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number who got off, 1/3 * 21 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the total cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the total cost of the monitors:

Total cost of monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Total cost of monitors = $2,400 - $700
Total cost of monitors = $1,700

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can divide the total cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls. Since the girls are divided into two equal groups, the number of girls is half of 20, which is 10.

300 shells / 10 girls = 30 shells per girl.

The final answer is 30."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. The total amount of money is the sum of what Jeff and Brad get, which is x + 4x = 5x. We know this sum is equal to $100.

5x = 100

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply x by 4 to find Jeff's share:

Jeff's share = 4x
Jeff's share = 4 * 20
Jeff's share = 80

The final answer is 80."

Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 = $10

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the additional commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Twice the time on a cold day is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes per mile. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $80, we divide the target savings by his weekly earnings:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to calculate thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub. 

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. 

Thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub is 3 * $40 = $120.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $120.

The total cost for both subs is $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, and each of these buttons has 4 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to calculate the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours.

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun is moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = rate * time
Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
Change in angle = 50 degrees

Since the sun is moving upward, the angle will increase. The new angle of the sun relative to the ground will be the initial angle plus the change in angle.

New angle = initial angle + change in angle
New angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
New angle = 82 degrees

The final answer is 82."
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the number of candles per pack is 5, we can divide the number of sons by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

12 (older son) / 5 = 2.4 (round up to 3 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)
8 (younger son) / 5 = 1.6 (round up to 2 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, James needs to buy 3 packs of candles for the older son and 2 packs for the younger son. 

3 (packs for the older son) + 2 (packs for the younger son) = 5 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost is 5 packs * $3 = $15.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number eaten from the initial number: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received half of that amount for each of the last two teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can use the information given. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A, the number of goals scored by Mark as M, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R. 

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20. 

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

Since we know Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation: 80 = M + 20. Solving for M, we get M = 60.

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute M = 60 into the second equation: 80 = A + 45. Solving for A, we get A = 35.

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can add up the goals scored by all three teenagers: 35 (Anna) + 60 (Mark) + 80 (Richie) = 175.

The total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Amount made by Liam = $63
Amount made by Mitchell = $84

Difference in the amount made by Mitchell and Liam = Amount made by Mitchell - Amount made by Liam
Difference in the amount made by Mitchell and Liam = $84 - $63
Difference in the amount made by Mitchell and Liam = $21

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spent: $20 (wooden) + $6 (plastic) = $26.

Since Peter started with $70, he has $70 - $26 = $44 left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money. For the wooden action figures, he can buy $44 / $5 = 8.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of an action figure, he can buy 8 wooden action figures.

For the plastic action figures, he can buy $44 / $2 = 22.

So, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

Total action figures = 8 (wooden) + 22 (plastic) = 30.

The final answer is 30."

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the total number of roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the shops per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in 2 years as follows:

$100 per month * 12 months per year = $1200 per year
$1200 per year * 2 years = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first determine how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

Now, we can multiply the number of muffins by the selling price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total area of the room and then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 450 * 1.04 = 468.

However, the recipe calls for 520 degrees. Since the oven is 18 degrees higher than the set temperature, we need to add 18 to the correct set temperature: 468 + 18 = 486.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 486 degrees.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, the number of days one pair of contacts will last is:
45 days / 90 contacts = 0.5 days per pair

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill's total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned, which is 1600 / 200 = 8 units.

To find the total ml of water needed, we multiply the number of units by 100 ml/unit, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends, so the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial guests, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 100 + 200 + 20 = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay would be 2 * $4 = $8.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay by adding the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $16 (Amazon) = $5.

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

We can set up an equation to represent the sum of the angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The angle twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
- The angle three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents: 
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add the values together: 
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 34."
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours separately and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year.

First, we need to find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a month. Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven per month to get the total number of rotations per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of rotations per month by 12 to get the total number of rotations per year:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the total number of rotations per year (1,740,000) to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will need to be replaced in approximately 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the total cost by the number of washings per pump. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 60
Cost per pump = $0.40

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $0.40 * 100
Cost per pump = 40 cents

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 

Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as follows:

Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit, including sales tax, is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase.

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to a total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not eat any meat, so their contribution to the total is 0 ounces.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine the total number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Substituting S = 16 into the equation for T, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting T = 19 into the equation for R, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is approaching Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are interested in the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum amount he can afford to miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Manny's total budget for the classes is $60. If he misses classes, the cost per class will increase by the amount he misses. 

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. The total cost for the classes he attends will be 10 - x. The cost per class will be (10 - x) / 10.

Since the cost per class should not exceed $10, we can set up the inequality:

(10 - x) / 10 ≤ 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

10 - x ≤ 100

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

-x ≤ 90

Multiplying both sides by -1 flips the inequality sign:

x ≥ -90

Since the number of classes cannot be negative, we can ignore the negative value. 

Therefore, Manny can miss 9 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

The answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, we need to calculate his new monthly salary including the bonus: 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: 372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500

The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

The first website publishes 20 articles per day, and the second website publishes 10 articles per day. 

Total articles per day = 20 (political) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day.

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is:

Total articles in February = 30 articles per day * 28 days = 840 articles.

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to break down the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags. 

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since he wants to buy one of each type of cupcake, he needs 2 cupcakes for each person. 

Total cupcakes needed = 2 * 27 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Simplifying the equation:
x + 22000 = 70x

Subtract x from both sides:
22000 = 69x

Divide both sides by 69:
x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial number of likes to the 20000 new likes:
319 + 20000 = 21919

The final answer is 21919."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila. The correct answer is $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of the green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales for the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4:

Total sales for the second month = 1200 * (3/4)
Total sales for the second month = 900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales of both months:

Total amount made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount made in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to get the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert 24 eggs into dozens. To do this, we divide 24 by 12, which gives us 2.

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice that, which is $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 (initial cost) + $15,000 (monthly cost) * 12 (months) = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: 330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each type of nut separately and then add them together.

For the first mixture, the cost is:
- 1/2 pound almonds at $10 per pound = 1/2 * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, the cost is:
- 1/5 pound almonds at $10 per pound = 1/5 * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound walnuts at $15 per pound = 1/3 * $15 = $5

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the target height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 600 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

600 inches / 12 = 50 feet

Now, we know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 50 feet, we can divide the target height in feet by the growth rate in inches per day.

50 feet / 30 inches/day = 50 / 30 days

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.

50 / 10 = 5
30 / 10 = 3

So, the bamboo will take 5 days to reach 50 feet.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since 3 dogs were gone, there were 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then determine how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally, calculate the total number of cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) = 202 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending the dress by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

First, we subtract the 20cm added to the bottom: x - 20cm.

Then, we divide the result by 1.5 (since the dress was extended by 50%): (x - 20) / 1.5.

We know the final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: (x - 20) / 1.5 = 140.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 1.5: x - 20 = 210.

Then, we add 20 to both sides: x = 230.

The original length of the dress was 230cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have spent walking so far and subtract it from the total time available.

They have spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

6 + 13 = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes available.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y:

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 5, then 3y = 15, and 2x = 19. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 6, then 3y = 18, and 2x = 16. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 7, then 3y = 21, and 2x = 13. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 8, then 3y = 24, and 2x = 10. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 9, then 3y = 27, and 2x = 7. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 10, then 3y = 30, and 2x = 4. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 11, then 3y = 33, and 2x = 1. This doesn't yield an integer value for x.

If y = 12, then 3y = 36, and 2x = -32. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 13, then 3y = 39, and 2x = -29. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 14, then 3y = 42, and 2x = -26. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 15, then 3y = 45, and 2x = -23. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 16, then 3y = 48, and 2x = -16. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 17, then 3y = 51, and 2x = -13. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 18, then 3y = 54, and 2x = -10. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 19, then 3y = 57, and 2x = -7. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 20, then 3y = 60, and 2x = -4. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 21, then 3y = 63, and 2x = -1. This doesn't yield a non-negative integer value for x.

If y = 22, then 3y = 66, and 2x = 2. This yields x = 1, which is a non-negative integer.

So, the age of the younger twin is 1.

The age of the older twin is x + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time before dinner: 
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 

10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of four candies is $3.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the cost of four candies by 4.

$3.20 / 4 = $0.80

Now, we can find the cost of 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one candy by 10.

10 candies * $0.80 = $8.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is the sum of their individual costs.

$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, and there are 12 months in a year, Rong has been saving for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, the total number of coins he has saved is 20 * 120 = 2400.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. Therefore, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 * 120 = 3360.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total bill. 

Let's denote the total bill as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

We also know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

We are told there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of square feet is 68."
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of regular chairs and high chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
= 40 + 8
= 48

Since there are 57 attendees (42 adults and 15 babies), Mia needs to get:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of attendees - Total number of chairs
= 57 - 48

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

Total drinks consumed = 14 people * 2 drinks/person = 28 drinks
Total snacks consumed = 14 people * 3 snacks/person = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (Total drinks * $2) + (Total snacks * $2)

Total cost = $56 + $84
Total cost = $140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = New price of each computer * Number of computers

"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave away, we need to calculate the number of sacks she gave to her cousin and brother, then multiply that by the weight of each sack.

She gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the time spent in that scenario.

When both hands are at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, the combined rate is 200 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total. She spends 2 minutes with her arms raised and 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.

The number of taps with her arms raised is 200 * 2 = 400 taps.

The number of taps with her arms at her sides is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

The total number of taps is 400 + 1650 = 2050 taps.

The final answer is: 2050"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have received from the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by doing something that would cause damage, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $195 (total cost) - $0 (no damage) = -$195.

The final answer is -195."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices.

Initially, there were 5 pizzas, each with 12 slices, making a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices in each pizza, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. 

The total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 8. 

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices in each pizza, they ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43 slices.

Therefore, 43 slices of pizza were left.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 

The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. 
So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. 
Average time = (time taken by cat + time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

For students' cars:

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people):
   2/3 * 3000 = 2000

4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs Parker needs, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he needs for 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, for 30 days, he will need 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack has 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 12. 

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, not the total number of groups.

To find the number of additional groups needed, we can subtract the number of groups already required from the total number of groups needed. 

Total groups needed = 54 students / 4 students per group = 13.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 14 groups.
Number of groups already required = 12

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from this trade.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. 
So, she has a total of 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of the second house, so if we let x be the number of cases needed for the second house, the first house needs x/2 cases.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house = 2 * (100) = 200

The third house needs 200 cases of shingles.

"To calculate the total amount spent, we need to add up the cost of the items purchased by each person.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them to make a salad for the potluck is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

60"
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read.

300 + 150 = 450

Therefore, Ezra and Ahmed have read 450 books altogether.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

However, she also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $65 + $30 = $95.

The final answer is: $95"
"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

The difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4.

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has, which is 25. 

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time spent driving.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and since Jack drives back, the total distance is 150 * 2 = 300 miles.

The time taken to cover this distance is given by time = distance / speed. So, the time taken for the round trip is 300 / 75 = 4 hours.

Adding the 6 hours spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.

"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he has 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he has 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we know the cost of the movies in series and the older movies. The cost of the normal movies is $10. We can calculate the total cost as follows:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies
= $2000 + $800
= $2800

The final answer is: $2800"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the time they spent driving. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's points:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715.

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took 17 fish from the pet store, Bob had 3 + x orange fish and 4 + y white fish.

Since the total number of fish after adding the new ones is not given, we need to find the total number of fish Bob had initially and the total number of fish he had after adding the new ones.

Initially, Bob had 3 + 4 = 7 fish.

Let's assume the total number of fish after adding the new ones is 7 + z.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x = 2(4 + y)

We also know that the total number of fish after adding the new ones is 7 + z, so we can set up another equation:

3 + x + 4 + y = 7 + z

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can simplify the first equation:

3 + x = 8 + 2y

Subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 5 + 2y

Now, substitute x into the second equation:

3 + (5 + 2y) + 4 + y = 7 + z

Combine like terms:

12 + 3y = 7 + z

Subtract 7 from both sides:

5 + 3y = z

Now, we need to find the value of y. We can use the fact that the total number of fish after adding the new ones is 7 + z. Since we know that 3 + x = 2(4 + y), we can substitute x = 5 + 2y into this equation:

3 + (5 + 2y) = 2(4 + y)

Expand and simplify:

8 + 2y = 8 + 2y

This equation is true for any value of y, so we need to use the fact that the total number of fish after adding the new ones is 7 + z. We can set up an equation using the fact that the total number of fish after adding the new ones is 7 + z:

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles * 5 days = 25 miles per week.

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven / Fuel efficiency
Weekly fuel consumption = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, we add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount he has from it. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost minus the school's contribution: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the house needs to be heated up to 32 degrees, and it's already 45 degrees during the day, we need to heat it up by 32 - 45 = -13 degrees.

However, since we can't heat the house down, we need to heat it up by 32 degrees to reach the freezing point. To do this, we need to calculate the number of logs needed to heat up the house by 32 degrees.

Each log heats the house up by 5 degrees. To heat up the house by 32 degrees, we need 32 / 5 = 6.4 logs.

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 7 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total people / Group size
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells as follows:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people: 172
People who got off at the first stop: 47
People who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off. 
Number of people after the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

The final number of people on the train is 100.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000.

The final answer is: $1,040,000."
"To determine the total caroling time, we need to add the time taken by each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they plan to sing it twice, so the total time for this song is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they plan to sing it once, so the total time for this song is 1 * 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the total time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, they will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours. 

Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so 1 week is 7 days. 

Total hours played in 1 week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours. 

Hours left to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car is faster, it will be ahead of the first car. The distance between them will be the difference in the distances they traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold and the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches that Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we need to first find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches in one bag: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches in one bag by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know that Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we need to divide the total number of square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has: 200 - 150 = 50.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his butterscotch candies.

Initially, they had 35 marshmallows. After dropping 3, they have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 32 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids. 

32 S'mores / 2 = 16 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.
- The better friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other two friends played for 10 minutes each, so they spent 2 * (10 / 20) = 1 quarter each.
- The better friend played for 30 minutes, so he spent 30 / 20 = 1.5 quarters.

Total cost: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.5 = 4.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 4.5 * $0.25 = $1.125."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:

Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time she walked on both days:

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (in minutes) = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok activities: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours

The final answer is: 38"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the number of additional items Angela needs to have installed. 

She has 6 mirrors, but the firm offers installation for 4 mirrors, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the firm offers installation for 1 chandelier, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the firm offers installation for 10 pictures, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

Now, we can calculate the total number of additional items: 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of installation for these additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings.

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance traveled = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, we can calculate the speed of each turtle as follows:

Speed of each turtle = Combined speed / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Speed of each turtle
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first determine the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of dishes by adding the number of dishes made by each of them: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
So, the total number of slices Adam initially had is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can calculate the milk production per cow as follows:

Milk production per cow = Total milk per day / Number of cows
Milk production per cow = 5 liters / 3 cows
Milk production per cow = 1.67 liters per cow

Now, we can calculate the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day:

Number of cows needed = Total milk per day / Milk production per cow
Number of cows needed = 25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow
Number of cows needed = 15 cows

The farmer needs 15 - 3 = 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks Jack and Peter have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks he has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks they have together, we add the number of dishes and socks.

60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is the total number of floral shirts minus the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for a numerical answer.

Initially, the river had 4000 gallons of water. After the first day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We are given that together, they have 85 books. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has:

Fawn has x + 12 books = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of jello needed, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. 

There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required. 

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we calculate 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

$33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had (52) to the marbles his friend gave him (28). 

52 + 28 = 80

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend. 

1/4 of 80 is 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost (20) from the total marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend (80).

80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add the scores from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens will be:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to be sold * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= 9000

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so we can set up an equation to find the total cost:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
9000 - Total cost = 2000

Now, we can solve for the total cost:

Total cost = 9000 - 2000
= 7000

Since Isaias is selling 180 chickens, we can find the cost of one chicken by dividing the total cost by the number of chickens:

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Number of chickens
= 7000 / 180
= 38.89

The final answer is: 38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people in total. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to buy the rope for $2 per meter, so the total amount she can get for the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she can get for the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. In 10 years, she will be 18. So, we can write the equation as:

x + 10 = 3x

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 

Subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation:
10 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:
5 = x

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 5, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 5 = 15. Since she is currently 5, we need to find the difference between 15 and 5:
15 - 5 = 10

So, it will take 10 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. So, 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert:

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones were successfully paired. 

We can calculate the number of successfully paired microphones as follows:
80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of successfully paired microphones by 2 to get the number of pairs:
40 / 2 = 20

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. This includes the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We already know the cost of the salad and the yogurt, which is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total daily cost to find the cost of two carrots. $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of two carrots by 2. $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To calculate Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

Mark makes $480 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 8x * $6 = $48x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $48x.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact amount she made from lemonade sales. We can only express it in terms of 'x'. 

But we can find the value of 'x' by using the information that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times, and she was paid $6 for it, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for 'x', we get x = 1.

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales: $80 - $48x = $80 - $48(1) = $32.

The final answer is 32."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Martha had 3x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 7

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: 
x = 7 / 3 
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph initially had approximately 2.33 notebooks. 

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks. 
Joseph still has 2.33 notebooks. 
Martha now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's: 
12 - 2.33 = 9.67

The final answer is 9.67."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding Dijana's and Anis's distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can hold 8 bowls of soup (the larger number).

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup.

There are two children, so we divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, the material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yards.
For 20 small masks, the total material needed is 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yards.
For 8 large masks, the total material needed is 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

The total material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks is 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4: 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total distance driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them.

$31 / 2 = $15.5.

The final answer is 15.5."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total.

56"
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold, then multiply it by the profit per lollipop, and finally multiply by the number of students.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students, so the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

The class raised $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea and there are 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since the tea is divided into 3 rows, and the amount of mint tea in each row is equal, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the amount emptied from the initial amount.

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen on this Friday, but we know he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. Let's assume he's seen 5 movies on this Friday. If he's seen 5 movies on this Friday, he's already spent $10 * 5 = $50 on tickets. 

Now, he has $134 - $50 = $84 left. 

Since he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, he'll spend $8 + $2 = $10 more. He'll be left with $84 - $10 = $74.

Now, we need to find out how many $10 tickets he can buy with $74. $74 / $10 = 7.4. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 7 tickets.

So, Colby can see 7 more movies on this Friday."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying this, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, and Maria had 1 balloon. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend + 1 balloon (Maria) = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 balloons (initial) + 15 balloons (additional) = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To determine the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated and the existing boxes.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes

Total boxes: 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat and then find the average.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance she spat is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance she spat is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances and divide by 2 (since there are 2 people):

(400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The cost for these additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay with additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also spent 10 dollars on 5 pencils, so he has 250 - 10 = 240 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 240 - 100 = 140 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25: 140 / 25 = 5.6.

Since John can't buy a fraction of a pen, he can buy 5 pens.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor cost = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total labor cost is $70. However, since the rate is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, the actual labor cost is $70.

The total cost of parts is $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $70 + $60
Total cost = $170

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The total revenue from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30.
The total revenue from the sales of 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Now, we can calculate the commission for each newspaper:
- Commission from the New York Times: $30 * 10% = $30 * 0.10 = $3
- Commission from the Wall Street Journal: $150 * 8% = $150 * 0.08 = $12

The total commission is the sum of the commission from each newspaper: $3 + $12 = $15

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

The total points scored by all three is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Since Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points, we substitute x = 15 into the equation: (15 + 10) - 20 = 5.

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of 15-minute intervals.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30.

60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to convert both times to minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes before 12 a.m.
5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes after 12 a.m.

Now, we subtract the wake-up time from the sleep time: 600 - 355 = 245 minutes.

However, she also slept from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to the total sleep time: 245 + 23 = 268 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we need to convert the number of cups to a numerical value. 

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups. 

Now, we can find the number of measuring spoons: 
2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons: 
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups. After gifting 6 measuring spoons, he still has 24 measuring cups.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and measuring cups: 
10 + 24 = 34.

The final answer is 34."

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then multiply it by 3. 

Since Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, we know Shawna's age and the fact that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 

So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

38.4"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of balls each boy picked up. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 1 ball. 

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins must have received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

The total distance traveled by the bird is the sum of the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years.

"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet and then add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we are looking for the difference in the number of cherries, we can take the absolute value of the difference.

Difference = | -10 |
Difference = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the respective cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

Gingerbread earnings on Saturday: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Gingerbread earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
Total gingerbread earnings: $60 + $90 = $150

Apple pie earnings on Saturday: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
Apple pie earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
Total apple pie earnings: $165 + $225 = $390

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $390 = $540

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:
1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

The average size of the two shoes is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between each plant (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches) from the total length of the flower bed. 

1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches

Since each flower is 12 inches wide, we can fit 1314 / 12 = 109.5 flowers in the bed. However, since we can't have half a flower, we'll round down to 109 flowers.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 92 flowers * $6/flower = $552.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate his brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

For the sunflowers, 4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
For the carnations, 10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = 0.5

"To determine the time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the peeling time:

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Since peeling and cooking time is the same, we can add the peeling time to the cooking time:

15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the two:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, and it was off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by:
2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we need to subtract the net cooling effect from the warming effect to find the final temperature difference:
6 degrees (net cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 2 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

15 = x

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

2. He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill.
3. He writes 2 checks per month for the church.
4. He writes 1 check every 3 months for the pest and lawn service, so in a year, he writes 4 checks for this service.

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks per month:
1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of checks per year is:

"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips made by the first plane, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane's flights are split between Greece, France, and Germany. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22, and then divided by 2, which equals 11 flights.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total time in seconds by 60.

Total time in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children. 

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find Helene's age by multiplying the average age by 2.

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4. Now, we can find the sum of their ages.

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 10 = 17

Since the total age is 20, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of the other three children's ages from the total age.

Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies were given to the church, so the number of cookies given is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices for the adults is 4. 

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of slices for adults / total number of slices) * 100
= (4 / 6) * 100
= 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

"To determine the total time spent on inpatient rounds, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. 

10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Again, we convert the total time spent on appointments to hours.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent.

3 hours (inpatient rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total available time to find the time left for updating records.

9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 
Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

64"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly earnings = (Cost of renting the studio per week) + (Cost of renting the studio per student per week)
Weekly earnings = $25 (renting the studio) + $1.50 * 10 (students) * 3 (days per week)
Weekly earnings = $25 + $45
Weekly earnings = $70

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $70 * 4
Monthly earnings = $280

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $280."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by the formula V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 7.48 gallons, we can convert the volume to gallons by multiplying by 7.48:

1400 * 7.48 = 10472 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed:

10472 * 5.9 = 61928 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the total amount of water needed by the cost per gallon:

61928 * 0.10 = 6192.80

The cost to fill the pool will be $6192.80.

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.09x * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
= 0.55x - 0.1025x
= 0.4475x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To determine the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Since Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her total hourly wage: $2,000 / $25 = 80 hours.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we divide the total hours needed by the number of hours she works per week: 80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to get the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to get the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages James read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

15 guests checked out late, leaving 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Now, we add the guests who checked in after dinner: 61 (remaining guests) + 30 (afternoon check-ins) + 7 (after dinner check-ins) = 98 guests.

"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, she will get 0.75 * 24 = 18 points from the easy questions.

The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since they are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by adding the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day. 

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30. 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. 

We know that the price of the package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the package with 4 sandwiches is $6. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion:

3 / 2 = 6 / 4

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 4 = 6 * 2
12 = 12

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $3.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2
Total number of blue balloons = 6 (already had) + 2 (added) = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school:
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 8
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 36

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Now, let's add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.1 = 0.7

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and we want to split them equally among the graduates, we divide 4750 by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

Total hours worked = 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total earnings = Total daily earnings * Total hours worked
Total earnings = $15 * 18
Total earnings = $270

Total expenses = Total daily expenses * Total hours worked
Total expenses = $12 * 18
Total expenses = $216

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move between each bottle.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost due to not working while in school, we need to consider the income Jim would have earned during those 4 years. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money lost due to not working: 
$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he would have earned during those 4 years with his new income: 
$75,000 per year * 4 years = $300,000

The total amount of money lost due to not working while in school is $100,000. To find out how much he needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to add the total amount of loans: 
$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

The total amount he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Now, let's calculate how long it would take to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000 per year: 
$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $32.5 / 3 = $10.83

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $10.83."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.08 feet."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920. 

We can write the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 4x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides: 4x = 1760

Divide both sides by 4: x = 440

So, the first person took $440.

The final answer is: 440"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the time to hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 3:

9 hours/day * 3 weeks = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters (4):

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: The car's price is $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. The new price is $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306. The new price is $15,800 - $3,306 = $12,494.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,494, which is $2,616. The new price is $12,494 - $2,616 = $9,878.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,878.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. However, since the tiles are square, we need to square the length of the tile to get the area of a single tile. 

Area of a single tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt

Now, we can calculate the total number of tiles required:

Total tiles = Total area / Area of a single tile
Total tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total tiles = 200

Since each tile costs $12, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost per tile:

Total cost = Total tiles * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food by the daily amount Imma feeds her cats.

First, we need to find out how many grams of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day. Since she feeds her 3 cats twice a day, the total daily amount is 3 * 2 = 6 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (6 grams):

720 grams / 6 grams/day = 120 days

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last 120 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate: 
Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10. 
Solving for x, we get x = 7. 
So Jake ate 7 slices. 

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by each person: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers, so the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($120), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost is $150 + $200 + $120 + $12 = $482.

First, we find 20% of 80 emails that don't require a response: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responsive emails from the total:
80 - 16 = 64 emails

Now, we multiply the number of responsive emails by the number of days in a work week (5):
64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store is offering a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter. 

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00."
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which makes 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. 

The number of additional guests is 28 - 20 = 8.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 

315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 is 1.25 times 12)
Cost of 15 roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can convert $6.25 into quarters as follows:

$6.25 = 6 * $1 + 0.25
= 6 * 4 quarters + 0.25
= 24 quarters + 1 quarter

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x. The selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and then back home, we need to double the time it took him to walk to the store. 

Time = 1 hour * 2
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store and return home.

"To determine the cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 bunches of bananas at $3.00 each. 

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Since each bunch contains 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. The sum of their shares should equal the total length of the fence, which is 100 feet.

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- MTB earnings: 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX earnings: 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Trekking earnings: 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: 131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a week. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 1440 is 1440 / 16 = 90 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 90 * 2 = 180 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total minutes spent on learning per week = 200 + 180 = 380 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total hours spent on learning per week = 380 / 60 = 6.33 hours.

The final answer is 6.33."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the amount left before the velociraptors ate was 135 kilograms * 2 = 270 kilograms.

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 270 kilograms * 2 = 540 kilograms.

"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise, and she returned $15.00. So, the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that when the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Lauren wants to save for 20 years. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $1,200,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year. To do this, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

Since Lauren already has 0 years of work experience, she needs to work 60 more years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x.

We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

Now, we can equate this to 2x: 2x = 70. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 35. 

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce at least 20 toys in 10 hours to meet the demand.

To find the minimum number of toys the fifth worker must produce per hour, we divide the remaining number of toys needed (20) by the number of hours worked (10). 

20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

The fifth worker must produce at least 2 toys per hour to meet the demand.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris initially had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 23 * 2 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed by multiplying the average car's speed by 5.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The faster car can go 750 Miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.

We know the following information:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A = M = S + 12

Now, we can substitute the value of A and M into the second equation:
(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now that we know C, we can find A:
A = S
A = 9

To find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold, we subtract A from C:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces, which is equivalent to 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume she walks at a speed of x miles per minute on the beach. This means she walks at 2x miles per minute on the sidewalk.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. So, we can set up the equation 2x * 40 = 2 miles to find her speed on the beach. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1 mile per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 miles per minute.

We know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 2 miles per minute = 0.5 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 minutes + 0.5 minutes = 40.5 minutes.

The final answer is 40.5."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he initially had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. Since he has two mugs, and we know one mug is 33 degrees, we can assume the other mug is also 33 degrees for now.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and he is now able to drink the water. This means the total amount of water he has is at least 5 ounces.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and the first mug has 4 ounces, the second mug must have 1 ounce. 

Now, we know the second mug has 1 ounce, and it's at least 40 degrees. Since the temperature of the water is directly proportional to the amount of water, we can set up a proportion to find the minimum temperature of the second mug.

Let x be the minimum temperature of the second mug. We can set up the proportion:

(33/33) = (x/1)

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

x = 33

However, this is not the correct answer. We know that the second mug has 1 ounce, and the temperature of the water is directly proportional to the amount of water. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If the second mug has 1 ounce, and Donny can drink the water after pouring 1 ounce, it means the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

The correct answer is 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals: 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 3 scoops require 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, 1 scoop requires 3 / 3 = 1 potato. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 1 scoop requires 1 potato, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1 potato/scoop = 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of non-blue jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is a multiplier for the ratio. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x. 

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus by multiplying the ratio of women (9) by x. 

Initial number of women = 9x
Initial number of women = 9 * 6
Initial number of women = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

Number of women who have remained = Initial number of women - 20
Number of women who have remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who have remained = 34

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his money, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

The cost of 20 rocks is 20 * 5 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The revenue from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.

Now, we subtract the revenue from the cost to find the loss: 100 - 84 = $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

"To determine the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand for one person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that one bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

To find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the energy demand, we divide the total energy demand by the energy covered by one bottle: 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we subtract the number of bottles needed from the production capacity to find out how many more bottles they need to produce: 2300 - 4200 is not correct, as it would result in a negative number. This is because the production capacity is greater than the required amount. 

The correct calculation is: 2300 - 4200 is not possible, but we can calculate the difference between the required amount and the production capacity: 4200 - 2300 = 1900."
"To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The number of blue babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2/3 (blue) = 8/3.

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows. 

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) = 3/4 or 75%.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13.

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day, he uses 2 face masks per day.

In 2 days, he will use 2 face masks/day * 2 days = 4 face masks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B. 

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the expressions for R and B in terms of Y into the equation, we get:
4B + B + Y = 37
5B + Y = 37

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation, we get:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that 15 - x = (4/5) * 15. 

Solving for x, we get:
15 - x = 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. 

Now, we know that Rissa was given $15 and gave $3 to her sister. So, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to his sister. So, the amount left with Ronnie is 5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as 'x'. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is divided among the remaining three colors. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'. The total amount of paint used for the other half is 'x + x + x = 3x'. Since this half of the mural is equal to the other half, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 12 / 3 = 4.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 'x', which is 4 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20)
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box for $1 by dividing the budget by the cost of one pod:

Number of cycles = Budget / Cost per pod
Number of cycles = 1 / 0.12
Number of cycles = 8.33

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of cycles = 8

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the total number of bills is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk he used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. 

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. 

He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. 

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 13 days."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of one set of 100 books ($500) to find the total number of sets he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books.

54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books Bob can buy per school.

First, we divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg) to get the total number of bags: 
850 kg / 50 kg/bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per unit ($18) to get the total cost:
17 bags * $18/bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of each type of pizza needed:

Cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
Pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's calculate the net rate of building snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt in an hour. So, the net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by the net rate (12). 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

It will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age when Digimon was released, and then find Jim's current age.

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can represent Jim's age as 'x'. Then, John's age would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 28.

To find Jim's age when Digimon was released, we need to know the year Digimon was released. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the exact release year of Digimon. However, I can provide a general solution.

Let's assume Digimon was released in year 'y'. Then, Jim's age at that time would be x, and John's age would be 2x.

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28 + (y - x), where 'y' is the year Digimon was released.

However, without knowing the release year, we can't find Jim's exact age. But we can express Jim's age in terms of 'x' and 'y'. 

If we knew the release year, we could find Jim's age by subtracting 'x' from it.

Assuming Digimon was released in 1999 (the actual release year is not provided), we can find Jim's age at that time: 

2x = 28 
x = 14

So, Jim's age when Digimon was released would be 14.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release. 

If we assume Digimon was released in 1999, Jim's current age would be 14 + (2023 - 1999) = 26.

However, without knowing the exact release year, we can't provide a precise answer.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

Next, divide both sides by 4: x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish without red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract 22 from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
5/11 * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 colors. 

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. So, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the house. However, the height of the roof is not directly given, but we can find it by subtracting the height of the first floor from the height of the house. 

So, the height of the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 - 240 = 0 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Therefore, team Gogetters found 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average miles walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles, we can set up an equation to find the total miles walked by all four dogs: 

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles walked per day * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find the miles walked by the last dog:

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles walked by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles walked by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first calculate the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine first. Since Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of the capacity of Ali's class and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

Capacity of Ali's class: 120 students
1/8 of Ali's class capacity: 120 * 1/8 = 15 students
Combined capacity of John's school: 15 * 2 = 30 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students."
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in those months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount ($300) plus the interest ($6), which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $306 in the twelfth month.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans off."
"To find the total number of people on the bus after the third station, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first station, 40 people entered, so the total number of people became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus now is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of people doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * 5 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. 

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. The total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * 3 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all groups to try the escape room. Each group has 45 minutes, and there are 3 groups:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

John has to pay Ali $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of secret seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of ground beef needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of secret seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of ground beef by 2 to find the total amount of secret seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric required = 2 * Total width
Total fabric required = 2 * 175
Total fabric required = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate the total inches of rain on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

The problem states that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. So, we need to calculate twice of Monday's total, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this result, which gives us 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure. 

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since Karen gets a 20% discount for getting both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 

20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3. 

The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art. 

The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The first magazine sends 12 issues per year.
The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.
The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all three magazines: 
12 (first magazine) + 6 (second magazine) + 24 (third magazine) = 42 issues per year.

So, Susan receives 42 magazines per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to first calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 lessons, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, so his reduced rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour
He has 2 lessons with the veteran, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran to get the total amount he will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

Walter had 36 apples left after eating 2/5 of them.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The total amount of money Walter received = 27 apples * $3/apple = $81.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all shelves is 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Next, we need to find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, and Rose bought 5 dozens, the total number of eggs is:

5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, we know that Rose will sell each egg for $1. So, the total revenue will be:

60 * $1 = $60

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $60 - $12

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4
Points scored per game: 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game
Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up one marble that wasn't a marble, but a bead. So, he got rid of that one, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make, we can break down the process into steps. 

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one customer to come into the dealership. This means that the conversion rate from calls to customers is 1/25 or 0.04. 

Next, we know that for every two customers, one buys a car. This means that the conversion rate from customers to sales is 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the conversion rate from calls to sales, we multiply the conversion rates: 0.04 * 0.5 = 0.02. This means that for every 25 calls, Jason gets 0.02 sales.

Now, we need to find out how many calls Jason needs to make to get 15 sales. We can set up a proportion to solve for the number of calls: 

0.02 = 15 / x
x = 15 / 0.02
x = 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of small candles = 8 / 2 = 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 candles
Number of medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 candles

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. So, the total number of flashlights = 4 flashlights

Total number of lights (candles and flashlights) = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we calculate the total number of chips: 2 bags * 55 chips per bag = 110 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week:
24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To determine the cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the total number of boxes Bob needs to buy. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 56 / 8 = 7.

Now, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost: 7 * $2.00 = $14.00.

The final answer is: $14."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 * 2 = $40.

The cost of the four additional phones is $40 * 4 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since June has 30 days, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts: 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words John can speak in 1 minute. Since his new speed is 375 WPM, he can speak 375 words in 1 minute.

To find out how many minutes it takes him to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can divide the total number of words by his speaking speed to find the time it takes him to speak 10 pages: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The time it would take John to speak 10 pages is 12 minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows: 1 cup / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 6 lemons per gallon.

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups as follows: 2 cups / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 12 lemons.

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon: 30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons.

The final answer is 42."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $8 + $24 = $32.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to add up the costs of the items they purchased.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: 335"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 2 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 20 pounds. 
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 1.5 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 15 pounds. 
The cost of honey for 10 jars is 2 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 20 pounds.

The total cost is 20 pounds * $6/pound + 15 pounds * $8/pound + 20 pounds * $10/pound = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is 10 jars * $50/jar = $500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $500 - $440 = $60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values of all the coins together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets for herself and her sister: 2 * $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total amount spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To calculate Josh's weekly earnings, we need to first determine how many days he is open in a week. Since he is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, he is open 5 days a week.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, his daily earnings are 3 cars * $4 per car = $12 per day.

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he is open in a week: $12 per day * 5 days per week = $60 per week.

Since we want to find his earnings for 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60 per week * 2 weeks = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the cookies he ate, and then add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
Now, he has 9 - 3 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies.

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has 6 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies.

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Now, he has 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has 4 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 4 + 7 + 6 = 17."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * $7 = $42.

The total earnings would be $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Enrollment at Norman High School
Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in enrollment = Enrollment at Norman High School - Enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in enrollment = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (the original number of beakers requested, 7, minus the number he gathered, 5).

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the total number of screws needed, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then multiply it by 2, since each leg needs 2 screws.

There are 4 tables, each with 4 legs, so the total number of legs is 4 x 4 = 16.

Since each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is 16 x 2 = 32.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can express this as 4 = 2x, where x is the distance Aaron ran. Therefore, x = 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Now, we can find Vanessa's speed by substituting A = 2V into the equation A = 1/8 miles per minute. This gives us 2V = 1/8 miles per minute. Solving for V, we get V = 1/16 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can calculate the time she took by dividing the distance by her speed: 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required length: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine.

The cost of meals per night is 2 meals * $5 per meal = $10.
Adding the cost of the wine, the total cost per night is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is $15 per night * 2 nights = $30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son when he was 19, and James is his son. Therefore, John's current age is 18 + 19 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * 400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 an hour. The labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. Then, we subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. Solving for b, we get b = 15. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
