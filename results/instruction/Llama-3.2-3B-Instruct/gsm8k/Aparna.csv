"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll consider she can only bake 3 muffins).

Now, she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left. She sells these 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

So, Janet makes 10 * $2 = $20 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance covered in a week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed given so far is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups per chicken.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed given so far is 2 * 20 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, the amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 40 cups (total given so far) + 40 cups (the amount she needs for the remaining 20 chickens) = 80 cups.

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (loss in the first year)

However, we are interested in when the tree starts earning money. We can continue calculating the net profit for subsequent years until we reach a positive net profit.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we add the distances covered by both trains: 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance covered by each train: 160 + 300 = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- Annual salary from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year = $35,000

Her annual salary from coaching: 
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- Annual salary from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year = $22,500

Now, let's add her annual salary from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in 1 week (7 days) she will make 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

In 4 weeks, she will make 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 - (4 + 2)
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Remaining distance / Time remaining
Speed required = 6 / 1
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the 24 liters of pineapple drink. Since the total amount is 24 liters, we can convert 46/3 to a decimal: 46/3 = 15.33 liters. 

Now, we add 15.33 liters to 24 liters: 15.33 + 24 = 39.33 liters.

The final answer is: 39.33"
"To find the age of Raymond when his son was born, we need to subtract 6 years from Samantha's current age, since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. 

Samantha's current age is 31. 
Raymond's age when his son was born = 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between the current year and the year Raymond's son was born. Since we don't know the current year, we can use the information about Raymond's age when his son was born. 

Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 25 years old. 

Since Raymond is 25 years old when his son was born, and we know that Raymond is 23 years old now, the difference between the current year and the year Raymond's son was born is 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes in that time period and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she will need is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop: 

60 - 45 = 15 miles.

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 15 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours spent per week.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money John has:
$195 - $160 = $35

John has $35 left. Since he started with $195, we can subtract the amount he has left from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on the video games:
$195 - $35 = $160

Now, we know that John spent $160 on the video games. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we can divide the amount he spent on the video games by the price of each Lego set:
$160 / $15 per set = 10.67 sets

Since John can't sell a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that he has $5 left, which means he didn't sell all his Lego sets. 

Let's recalculate the number of Lego sets he sold:
$195 - $160 = $35. He has $5 left, so he must have sold 10 sets to have $35 left.

Now, we know he sold 10 sets. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets:
13 - 10 = 3

John still has 3 Lego sets."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours

Total distance run per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed as follows:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 6 miles / 3.5 hours
= 1.7143 miles per hour

The final answer is 1.71."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

In 6 hours, she spends 6/3 = 2 hours running and 6/3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles/hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is 18."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Number of candles made = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost per candle = $10.00 (1 pound of beeswax and the wick)
Number of candles made = 20
Total cost = Cost per candle * Number of candles
Total cost = $10.00 * 20
Total cost = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

So, Charlie's net loss is $160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 300 - 23 = 277.

277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units, which is 120 - 90 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount more that the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The cost of a movie outing is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

The final answer is: 1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, her annual pension increases by 5% each year. 

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $58,131.25
Year 24: $58,131.25 * 1.05 = $61,240.81
Year 25: $61,240.81 * 1.05 = $64,453.08
Year 26: $64,453.08 * 1.05 = $67,750.34
Year 27: $67,750.34 * 1.05 = $71,157.85
Year 28: $71,157.85 * 1.05 = $74,659.31
Year 29: $74,659.31 * 1.05 = $78,261.93
Year 30: $78,261.93 * 1.05 = $82,000.00

The total pension after 30 years is the sum of the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years: $50,000 * 20 + $82,000 = $1,000,000 + $82,000 = $1,082,000.

The final answer is: $1,082,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.
10% of $140 is 0.1 * 140 = $14
So, the amount charged for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. Since she put in 4 gallons to fill the 12-gallon tank, we subtract 4 from 12 to get the remaining gas: 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons. To do this, we divide the remaining gas by the miles she has already traveled: 8 / 100 = 0.08 miles per gallon.

Now, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank: 0.08 * 12 = 0.96 miles per gallon.

So, Sophia can drive approximately 0.96 miles per gallon.

The final answer is: 0.96"
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 48.

48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is 36."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost and the total interest to get the total amount Shiela will pay each month: $750 + $15 = $765.

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3: $765 / 3 = $255.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the first year.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

The remaining days in the first year are 365 - 180 = 185 days. In the remaining days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining days is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry = 400 pounds
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can calculate Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls got. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:
1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is:
2 * 4 = 8 liters

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got:
8 + 6 = 14 liters

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

We know that Lee's speed is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's speed is x + 2. We also know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can find his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 1.1 times his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 400 / 9.22 seconds.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes.

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce she made is half of the original volume, which is x/2 = 32 ounces.

To find the original volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can divide the original volume of the tomatoes (64 ounces) by 16 ounces to find out how many cans she used, which is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains three tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used, which is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 (the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes).

We also know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for all four friends: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is 5 * 1 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 1 glass of water on Sunday. So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is 2.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week. 

Total glasses of water = glasses of water on weekdays + glasses of water on weekends
Total glasses of water = 5 + 2
Total glasses of water = 7

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes

Time = 14 * 10
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has already placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because we know Frankie watched some TV on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent on these days is 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 7.5 = -0.5 hours. However, we can't have negative hours, so let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since she can't row a fraction of a set, we'll consider 3 sets of 20 feet.

Since she rows 20 feet and takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, she takes on 1 liter of water for every 5 feet. 

Now, we can multiply the number of sets (3) by the amount of water taken on per set (1 liter) to get 3 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write another equation:
B = 50D

Since we know the value of B, we can substitute it into the equation:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since Sasha sells all the lumber, the total selling price is also $180.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $180 - $180
Profit = $0

"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total amount of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation to find Lylah's salary. 

Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as 'x'. 

Adrien's salary four years ago = x + 30% of x 
Adrien's salary four years ago = x + 0.3x 
Adrien's salary four years ago = 1.3x 

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 

1.3x = 40,000 
x = 40,000 / 1.3 
x = 30,769 

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. 

Adrien's salary four years later = 40% more than his salary four years ago 
Adrien's salary four years later = 1.4 * 40,000 
Adrien's salary four years later = 56,000 

Lylah's salary four years later = 40% more than her salary four years ago 
Lylah's salary four years later = 1.4 * 30,769 
Lylah's salary four years later = 43,276 

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of their individual salaries.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters Jennie put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = 30 - 20 = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are given that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

Total hours spent on patients per day = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients per day - Total cost of doctors' time per day

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide that by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate how many times he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests per year

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 45 bees had returned before this, so 60 - 45 = 15 bees from the second wave of bees leave without returning.

The remaining bees from the second wave that leave in the next 6 hours are 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours, we need to add the 30 bees that initially left to the 45 bees that left in the second wave. 

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 (initially left) + 45 (remaining from the second wave) = 75 bees.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

Steve's time: Distance = 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet) = 15840 feet. Speed = 440 feet/minute. Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's time: Distance = 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet. Speed = 264 feet/minute. Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. To find the waiting time, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies: $10 - $6 = $4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since we can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll correct this by assuming the pigeons ate 3 fries less than the remaining fries, so they ate 7 - 3 = 4 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 7 = 14/3 = 4.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 4 fries.
7. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 7 - 4 = 3 fries.
8. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 fries.
9. Since 5 fries were left, the initial number of fries in the pack must have been 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to add the total hours for both types of days. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Now, we add the total hours for both types of days: 
144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly requirement and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly requirement is the sum of the bananas needed by the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. 

Monkeys: 200 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly requirement: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly requirement by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
She runs 180 yards * 34 times = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth of water on Tuesday first. 

The depth of water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth of water on Wednesday, we multiply the depth of water on Tuesday by 2/3. 

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also know there are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. If she loses 3 hours of freelance work, that's 3 hours * $35/hour = $105 in lost income.

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2.

Cost of pants = (Cost of hat + Cost of jacket) / 2

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert it to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation to find the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as C. The equation would be:

$10 (revenue per gallon) * number of gallons = $25 (profit) + C (total cost)

However, we don't know the number of gallons yet. We know that for each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons as G. Then, the total cost is $5 * G. We can now rewrite the equation:

$10 * G = $25 + $5 * G

Subtracting $5 * G from both sides gives us:

$5 * G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5 gives us:

G = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost:

C = $5 * G
C = $5 * 5
C = $25

However, this is the total cost, not the cost of lemons. Since they spend $3 on lemons per gallon, the cost of lemons is:

Cost of lemons = $3 * G
Cost of lemons = $3 * 5
Cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is 15."

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have is 350."

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: E = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's current age by adding 2 to Mark's age: E = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can simply multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since each member runs 400 meters.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time taken by the less well-rounded team. The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster. 

Time taken by the second runner = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Time taken by the third runner = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Time taken by the fourth runner = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0 * 100) = 0%

So, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom, we need to add the number of apples picked by each of them. 

Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples. 

Half of 20 apples is 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

The total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mom is 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (her mom's apples) = 30 apples.

"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used among the rabbits from the total straw used. 

Total straw used among small rodents = Total straw used - Straw used among rabbits
Total straw used among small rodents = 160 - 20
Total straw used among small rodents = 140

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'x'. The total number of rats is 3x. 

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used among the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total straw used among the small rodents is 140, so we can set up the equation:

18x = 140

To find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 140 / 18
x = 7.78 (round down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a rat)

So, there are 7 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $100
Rate = 2% or 0.02
Time = 3 months

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, to find the total amount Mandy should pay, we add the interest to the principal:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we divide the total transportation cost by the cost per bag to find the number of bags:
Number of bags = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags = $140 / $2
Number of bags = 70

However, this is the total number of bags transported, not the number of bags sold. Since the cost per bag is $20, and the selling price is $30, the profit per bag is $10. 

Number of bags sold = Total revenue / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $400 / $10
Number of bags sold = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Now, we need to add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $33
Total cost = $69

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $69 / 3
Cost per person = $23

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Daily amount of insects needed = Weekly amount / Number of days
= 3.5 / 7
= 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them up.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year.
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His new weekly earnings are $2100.

Total earnings for the year = (52 weeks * $2000) + $5000 (monetary reward)

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To get the total score of 558, we need to add the required score to 358. 

558 - 358 = 200.

So, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Let's denote the total cost of half a dozen plates as x. Then, the cost of twenty dozen cups is x - 1200.

We know that the cost of half a dozen plates is $6000. So, x = 6000.

Now, we can find the cost of twenty dozen cups: x - 1200 = 6000 - 1200 = 4800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost by 240: 4800 / 240 = 20.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $20.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn more from babysitting than from lawn mowing, we can conclude that she needs to babysit 12 times and mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

Third day customers = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

The final answer is 183."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water being drained from both pools is 8 gallons/minute.

After 4 minutes, the small pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool would have lost 2x * 4 = 8x gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means the amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the amount of water in the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 8x = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-6x = 4x - 64

Combine like terms:

-10x = -64

Divide both sides by -10:

x = 6.4

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool was 6.4 gallons.

Now, since the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

6.4 - 16 = -9.6 gallons

However, since we can't have a negative amount of water, this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

2x - 8x = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-6x = 4x - 64

Combine like terms:

-10x = -64

Divide both sides by -10:

x = 6.4

This solution still doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to set up the equation based on the current situation:

Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the big pool has 4y gallons of water.

We know that both pools have lost 16 gallons of water in total. Since the big pool lost 8x gallons of water, the small pool lost 8x - 16 gallons of water.

Since the big pool lost 8x gallons of water, the small pool lost 8x - 16 gallons of water. We also know that the big pool initially had 2x gallons of water, and the small pool initially had x gallons of water.

The total amount of water lost from both pools is 8x + (8x - 16) = 16x - 16.

Since the big pool has 4y gallons of water now, and it initially had 2x gallons of water, the amount of water added to the big pool is 2x - 4y.

The amount of water lost from both pools is equal to the amount of water added to the big pool. So, we can set up the equation:

16x - 16 = 2x - 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14x - 4y = 16

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons of water, and it lost 16 gallons of water. So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4(x - 16) = 2x - 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x - 64 = 2x - 4y

Subtract 2x from both sides:

2x - 64 = -4y

Add 64 to both sides:

2x = 64 - 4y

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 32 - 2y

Now, substitute x into the equation 14x - 4y = 16:

14(32 - 2y) - 4y = 16

Expand and simplify:

448 - 28y - 4y = 16

Combine like terms:

448 - 32y = 16

Subtract 448 from both sides:

-32y = -432

Divide both sides by -32:

y = 13.5

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

x - 16 = 13.5 - 16

x - 16 = -2.5

Since we can't have a negative amount of water, this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to set up the equation based on the current situation:

Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the big pool has 4y gallons of water.

We know that both pools have lost 16 gallons of water in total. Since the big pool lost 8x gallons of water, the small pool lost 8x - 16 gallons of water. We also know that the big pool initially had 2x gallons of water, and the small pool initially had x gallons of water.

The total amount of water lost from both pools is 8x + (8x - 16) = 16x - 16.

Since the big pool has 4y gallons of water now, and it initially had 2x gallons of water, the amount of water added to the big pool is 2x - 4y.

The amount of water lost from both pools is equal to the amount of water added to the big pool. So, we can set up the equation:

16x - 16 = 2x - 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14x - 4y = 16

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons of water, and it lost 16 gallons of water. So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4(x - 16) = 2x - 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x - 64 = 2x - 4y

Subtract 2x from both sides:

2x - 64 = -4y

Add 64 to both sides:

2x = 64 - 4y

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 32 - 2y

Now, substitute x into the equation 14x - 4y = 16:

14(32 - 2y) - 4y = 16

Expand and simplify:

448 - 28y - 4y = 16

Combine like terms:

448 - 32y = 16

Subtract 448 from both sides:

-32y = -432

Divide both sides by -32:

y = 13.5

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

x - 16 = 13.5 - 16

x - 16 = -2.5

Since we can't have a negative amount of water, this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to set up the equation based on the current situation:

Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the big pool has 4y gallons of water.

We know that both pools have lost 16 gallons of water in total. Since the big pool lost 8x gallons of water, the small pool lost 8x - 16 gallons of water. We also know that the big pool initially had 2x gallons of water, and the small pool initially had x gallons of water.

The total amount of water lost from both pools is 8x + (8x - 16) = 16x - 16.

Since the big pool has 4y gallons of water now, and it initially had 2x gallons of water, the amount of water added to the big pool is 2x - 4y.

The amount of water lost from both pools is equal to the amount of water added to the big pool. So, we can set up the equation:

16x - 16 = 2x - 4y

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time (in hours) = 60 / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many melons were remaining, we subtract the initial number of harvested melons from the total.

Remaining melons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining melons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's tomato consumption.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for the movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total amount before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. 

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We already know that the first and second classes have 15 and 12 girls, respectively. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 50% of the total number of students. The total number of students in the school is:
3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students
Number of boys in the school = 50% of 60 students
= 0.5 * 60
= 30 boys

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys:
Boys in the third class = Total boys - Boys in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 boys

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total animals killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to find the total weight of the wood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree by 10 to find the number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 70% of the total weight of the wood.

70% of 20 sections = 0.7 * 20 = 14 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight of the wood.

14 sections * 400 pounds per section = 5600 pounds

The total weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books:
8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee:
$4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

So, Nancy owes the library a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
= 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 40 / 5 = 8. 

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds. 

6000 / 2000 = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T / 11

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T / 11

Combine like terms:

39 = 10T / 11

Multiply both sides by 11 to isolate T:

39 * 11 = 10T

429 = 10T

Divide both sides by 10:

T = 429 / 10

T = 42.9

Since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the total number of medals given out, which should be a whole number. 

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 42.9, but since it's not possible to have a fraction of a medal, we can round it to the nearest whole number."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she earns: 150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15. 

So, Susan earns $15 for the online task."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges each son will wash. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He will wash 4 oranges.

In total, the two sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Aparna will buy 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12, the number of unwashed oranges will be 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for both days and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the counts for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities done in two days: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370"
"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and then add the crates sold over the weekend.

Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates
Crates sold over the weekend: 20 crates
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made after the initial bid is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids are $200 (initial bid) + $50 (first increment) = $250, $300, $350, and $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 (initial bid) + $250 + $300 + $350 = $800.

The desk costs Carmen $800."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

The final answer is: $45,000"
"To find out how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
The total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this case, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she brought.

Annika brought $50.
She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total money spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

The final answer is: 2200"

Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings for 20 days = 20 days * $10/hour = $200

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. 

Total earnings for April = Regular earnings + Bonus = $200 + $300 = $500

   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

The number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by the weight lost per week.

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight lost per week
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 2 pounds
Number of weeks = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can see a pattern. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $700 + $500 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $4000 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was:

Population six years ago = 3000N
= 3000(26)
= 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is twice the population six years ago:

Current population of Chile = 2 * 78000

The final answer is: 156000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who came: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (new marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since we know the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation 3x = 45. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 15. 

So, the number of electric poles required is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed: 120 / 24 = 5.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

5 * 13 = 65

This equation is true, so the cooling effect of the ice cubes is correct.

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. Each milliliter of cream makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, the weakening effect is:

15 * 12 = 180 milliliters

However, we need to consider that the coffee is already weakened by the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it is 65 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effect of the cream and the initial weakening effect of the cooling:

65 + 180 = 245 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 245 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 245"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

We know that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded. Since the ratio is 2:1, for every 1 new record, 2 old records were traded. 

So, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The final answer is 68."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000. 

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which is the number of ruined castles, and then divide that by 2, since half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of 88 is 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

8 shares * $9 = $72

Final value of Maria's shares: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we know John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the two equal-sized groups have the same number of students. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
= (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
= 80 + 80
= 160

The total number of legs is 160."
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we need to calculate how many balls he added to his act over the four weeks. 

Initially, Josh started with 3 balls. Each week, he added 1 ball to his act. 

So, after the first week, he had 3 + 1 = 4 balls.
After the second week, he had 4 + 1 = 5 balls.
After the third week, he had 5 + 1 = 6 balls.
After the fourth week, he had 6 + 1 = 7 balls.

However, Josh dropped 3 balls, and 2 of them were caught, so he lost 1 ball. Therefore, he started juggling with 7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 30% of total time = 15 hours.

Let's convert the percentage to a decimal: 30% = 0.3.

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15.

To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the cost per person includes the cost of one round of mini-golf ($5) and 2 go-kart rides ($20). 

Cost per person = $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (2 go-kart rides) = $25

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find the number of friends Morgan can invite:
$60 / $25 = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's divide the remaining money ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought: 8 / 1.5 = 5.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation: C = 2S - 5.

We also know that Carver is 45 years old. So, we can substitute C with 45 in the equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

To find S, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5) and the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10).

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(10) = 30.

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifters, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14. 

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY costs 20% less than the market price, the cost of the DIY will be 80% of the market price. 

So, 80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320. 

This means the cost of the materials is $320. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the labor. However, the problem doesn't mention the labor cost. 

Therefore, we can only calculate the cost of the materials, which is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours from each day. 

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is not given, we can assume that the total number of pieces is equal to the total amount spent, as the cost is directly proportional to the number of pieces.

Total number of pieces = Total amount spent / Cost per piece
However, we don't know the cost per piece. We can assume that the cost per piece is the total amount spent divided by the total number of pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as 'x'. Then, the cost per piece is $400,000 / x.

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= x - 160,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost per piece
= (x - 160,000) * ($400,000 / x)

To simplify the calculation, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces as a percentage of the total amount spent.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = (x - 160,000) * ($400,000 / x)
= (1 - 160,000/x) * $400,000

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since we know that the percentage of faulty pieces is 40%, we can set up an equation:

(160,000 / x) / (400,000 / x) = 0.4
160,000 / 400,000 = 0.4
0.4 = 0.4

This equation is always true, which means that we can't find the exact value of 'x'. However, we can express the total amount spent on functioning pieces as a percentage of the total amount spent.

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = (1 - 0.4) * $400,000
= 0.6 * $400,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she made a dozen (12) bread rolls and fed 6 children, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine how many socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, in total, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total to find out how many she has missed: 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother from the total number of cookies she initially had.

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel initially had and the number of cookies Janet gave her: 
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Then, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother: 
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total interest by the number of months.

Monthly interest = Total interest / Number of months
Monthly interest = $1,825 / 5
Monthly interest = $365

So, Karan has to pay $365 per month.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Total silver = 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150
Total gold = 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour.

36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit. 

Total revenue - initial cost = $36 - $18 = $18

Finally, we divide the total profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour.

$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

32"
"To find the initial number of girls in the choir, we can calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the remaining people after the teachers join. The total number of people initially performing is 26 (girls) + 26 (boys) = 52. 

Half of 52 is 26. Since the teachers join, we add 3 to 26, resulting in 29 people performing."

"To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11). 

First, we find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15. 

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for each person: 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he's bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month. 
The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 
To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42 per month.

So, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we convert the total energy used to kilowatt-hours:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

The new total energy usage in 30 days:
2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. 

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally bought. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 2S. Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can write the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 60 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + A = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

A = 410

So, Joanne gathered 410 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 410"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2c + d = 304. 

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as c + d = 180.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 'c' and 'd'. 

First, let's isolate 'c' in the second equation: c = 180 - d.

Now, substitute 'c' in the first equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304.

Expanding the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304.

Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304.

Subtract 360 from both sides: -d = -56.

Multiply both sides by -1: d = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size since it's half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between 6,000 feet and Oliver's current elevation of 3,000 feet. 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total capital = Initial capital + Amount received from the first bank + Amount received from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $14000

The final answer is: 14000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The final 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. Since the tattered jeans cost $6 more than the jogger jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the tattered jeans and jogger jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Total birds = 3(x + 10) + 3x
Total birds = 3x + 30 + 3x

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he sells 2/3 of the cards, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (the spending cash) = $150.

Since he gets $1 from selling 2/3 of the cards, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * $1.5 = $1

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

2/3 * $1.5 = $1
$1 = $1

This equation is true, but it doesn't help us find 'x'. We need to use the fact that Kenny has $150 after selling the cards. 

Let's set up the equation:

2/3 * $1.5 * x = $150

Solving for 'x':

2/3 * $1.5 * x = $150
$1 * x = $150
x = $150 / $1
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 
The total number of letters is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents.

Now, we know that George had 380 cents left after buying chips and had 5 cents left. This means he spent 380 - 5 = 375 cents on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide 375 by 75 to find out how many candy bars he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. 

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept by Ray) = 20 lollipops

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom each have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7 oranges per person.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and beef stock needed.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Since each pound costs $2.00, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to reach the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to reach the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Wayne needs 4 minutes to reach the theater, so Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before him.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours = 3
Total temperature increase = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees per 10 minutes
Time the window is open = 30 minutes = 3 * 10 = 30 minutes
Total cooling effect = 2 * 3 = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase:
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Cooling effect
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes less than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time - 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 - 10
James' total time = 160 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting James' swim time and bike time from James' total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 160 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 39 minutes

The final answer is 39."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the total cost of the hay as follows: 
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail 
Total cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * 3 
Total cost of hay = 24 dollars 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 

Now, we can find out how much change he has after buying the hay: 
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay 
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars 
Change = 6 dollars 

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points Marcy scored from Joey's points. 

Joey's points after scoring 26: 214 + 26 = 240

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the price of a popcorn as P and the price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. 

The total cost of the super ticket is the sum of the cost of the ticket and the cost of the popcorn and soda. Since the super ticket includes a popcorn and a soda, we can write the equation as:

20 = 12 + P + S - 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 11 + P + S

Now, we know that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the cost of the ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket. We can write this as:

12 + P + S = 20 - 2
12 + P + S = 18

Now we have two equations:

20 = 11 + P + S
12 + P + S = 18

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

8 = 11 - 12
8 = -1

This is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that the soda costs $3 is incorrect. However, we can still solve for P.

Let's go back to the first equation:

20 = 11 + P + S

We know that the soda costs $3, but we don't know the price of the popcorn. Let's try to find the price of the popcorn.

We can rewrite the equation as:

20 = 11 + P + 3
20 = 14 + P

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:

6 = P

So, the price of the popcorn is $6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost of filling 1 balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $900 / 20
Cost of filling 1 balloon = $45

Now, the cost of filling one balloon increased by $20. 

New cost of filling 1 balloon = Original cost + Increase
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $45 + $20
New cost of filling 1 balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Cost of filling 170 balloons = New cost of filling 1 balloon * Number of balloons
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $65 * 170
Cost of filling 170 balloons = $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

"To find the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."

- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 3700 / 2250 = 1.65.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the length of the remoras in feet is 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot.

The total length of the remoras is 1 foot.

The length of the shark is 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we can multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (7 days).

First, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Now, we can divide the total time in hours by the number of days:

4 hours / 7 days = 0.57 hours per day

To convert the result back to minutes, we can multiply by 60:

0.57 hours * 60 = 34.2 minutes

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.2 minutes each day for 7 days to break in the new shoes."
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances (dairy or peanuts). 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group and then add the number of tour guides.

Number of groups = 3
Number of employees in each group = 200
Number of tour guides = 7

Total number of employees = 3 * 200 = 600
Total number of tour guides = 7

Total number of people going on the tour = 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607

The final answer is: 607"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to get the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the amount Keegan and Tashay have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for five days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of oats in each bag (50 pounds). 

200 / 50 = 4

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The cost of the toy car is $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take for him to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount.

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost for 2 packs will be the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

24 * 5 = 120 minutes

Charisma walked for 120 minutes in 5 days."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find her age in four years, which will be three times Brett's current age. 

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we multiply Brett's age in four years by 3: 18 * 3 = 54. 

Now, we subtract 4 from 54 to find Angela's current age: 54 - 4 = 50.

Angela is 50 years old now."

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

There are 30 days in a month, so 8 months is 8 * 30 = 240 days. Adding the remaining 20 days, he has a total of 240 + 20 = 260 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 260 days ≈ 404 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 404 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday."

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4. 

The total cost is $120,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation: 

House cost + Lot cost = Total cost
3 * Lot cost + Lot cost = 120,000
4 * Lot cost = 120,000

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot:
Lot cost = 120,000 / 4
Lot cost = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:

Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, subtract the number of loaves sold: 200 - 93 = 107
Then, add the number of loaves returned: 107 + 6 = 113

The bakery had 113 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller number of rows. In this case, the blue tulips will limit the number of rows to 3.

The total number of rows will be 3.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies. 

First, we need to convert the fraction 3/4 into a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75 cups.

Now, we divide the total number of raisins (27 cups) by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies (0.75 cups): 

27 cups / 0.75 cups per batch = 36 batches

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time required as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

The final answer is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. 

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs together: 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 86."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

Number of CDs = Total amount spent on headphones / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since he didn't work out 4 hours for 2 weeks). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked out 5 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours for all the weeks together.
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Initially, there are 48 passengers.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed to make: 72
Vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down Elvis's monthly savings target into two halves. 

Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month would be 15 days, and the second half would also be 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as 'x'. Then, he wants to save twice as much in the second half, which is 2x.

The total savings for the month would be the sum of the savings in the first and second halves, which should equal his target of $1125.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms: 3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3: x = 375

This means Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 375 = $750 in the second half.

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we divide the amount for the second half by the number of days: 750 / 15 = $50.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

1125"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first. 

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's assume Brad gets x dollars. Then, Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = $80.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount on the total cost.
Discount = 10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2

Total cost after discount = $20 - $2 = $18

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * 1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours.

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun is moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = rate * time
Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
Change in angle = 50 degrees

Since the sun is moving upward, the angle will increase. The new angle of the sun relative to the ground will be the initial angle plus the change in angle.

New angle = initial angle + change in angle
New angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
New angle = 82 degrees

"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his older son. Since one son is 4 years younger than the other, and the older son is 12, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the younger son is 8 years old, he will need 8 candles. The older son is 12 years old, so he will need 12 candles. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5. 

Total candles needed = 8 (for the younger son) + 12 (for the older son) = 20 candles

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 

So, we can set up the equation: S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation, we get:

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals: 80 - 45 = 35.

So, the number of goals scored by each teenager is as follows:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent on wooden action figures from his initial amount of $70 to find out how much he has left: $70 - $20 = $50.

Since he spent $6 on plastic action figures, he has $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Now, we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he bought: $44 / $2 = 22.

To find the total number of action figures, we add the number of wooden action figures (4) to the number of plastic action figures (22): 4 + 22 = 26.

Therefore, Peter will have 26 action figures by the end of the week.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops in a month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 20 * 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 15 * 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

Total roses required by the shops in a month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses required by the shops in a month: 
260 - 160 = 100.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 1 year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

For 2 years, the total amount removed would be $1200 * 2 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

$600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves used + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, they will use 1 loaf for 10 sandwiches.
Total cost = $3.00 per loaf * 1 loaf + $30.00 per 10 sandwiches
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first determine how many crayons she has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

Now, we can multiply the number of muffins by the selling price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide by the number of days.

Let's calculate the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.
5. The resulting value from step 3 is multiplied by the result from step 4: 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
450 * 1.04 = 468

However, the actual temperature is 468, so we need to find the temperature that is 4% lower than the actual temperature. 
468 * 0.96 = 447.12

So, Maggie should set the oven to 447.12 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies to minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value. 
Combined value = Herb's house value + Juan's house value 
= $76,000 + $53,200 
= $129,200.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, the cost of each pair of contacts is:
$180.00 / 45 days = $4.00 per pair

The final answer is $4."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate their earnings:
Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml of water.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99 * 1500
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01 * 1500
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends. So, the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of people invited by Alex, the additional guests from her friends, and the additional guests from her friends' spouses. 

Total number of people = 100 (invited by Alex) + 200 (additional guests from her friends) + 20 (additional guests from her friends' spouses) = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 * 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 * 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 * 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily protein intake and then multiply it by 7.

Daily protein intake = 200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) / 4 cups (since 100 grams is 4 cups)
Daily protein intake = 200 * 3 / 4 = 150 grams

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
Weekly protein intake = 150 * 7
Weekly protein intake = 1050 grams

"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

- 14 nickels = 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total value of the coins:
$2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
$3.45 / $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight he initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of this amount, which is 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to first find out how many times it rotates in a month. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it will rotate 725 * 2 = 1450 times per mile. 

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tire will rotate 1450 * 400 = 580,000 times per month.

To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12. 
580,000 * 12 = 6,960,000 times per year.

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it will undergo in a year to find out how many years it will last. 
10,440,000 / 6,960,000 = 1.5 years.

The tire will last for 1.5 years before it needs to be replaced."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

- Discount: 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
- Total cost after discount: $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we'll assume it's 8% of the total cost after the discount (this is a common sales tax rate). 
- Sales tax: 8% of $42 = 0.08 * $42 = $3.36

Now, let's calculate the total cost including sales tax:
- Total cost including sales tax: $42 + $3.36 = $45.36

Finally, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left:
- Money left: $50 - $45.36 = $4.64

The final answer is: $4.64"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is 4 * 7 = 28.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we need to calculate how many dozen croissants that is equivalent to 28. 

28 / 12 = 2.33 dozen croissants. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 2.33 by 12 to get the total number of croissants: 2.33 * 12 = 28.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of butter needed. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4: 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the difference in cost, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Monica's street: 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100
Cost of repaving Lewis' street: 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250
- Month 10: $757,812.50

Now, we add up the funding for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,812.50 = $2,380,562.50

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,562.50 = $2,880,562.50

The final answer is: $2,880,562.50"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not eat any meat, so their ounces of meat consumption is 0.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by each player:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Total number of posts per day = 3
Total number of days in March = 31

Total number of posts in March = Total number of posts per day * Total number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. So, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat sold in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take to sell the meat: 750kg / 150kg = 5 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats after removing the seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 16 - 20 = -4. However, this is not possible as we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The problem states that each pole has 4 street lights, but it does not specify that each pole is a separate entity. It is likely that the 4 street lights at each intersection are actually 4 separate poles with 4 street lights each. 

If that's the case, then the total number of poles is 4 intersections * 4 poles per intersection = 16 poles. 

Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is 16 poles * 4 lights per pole = 64.

Now, if 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning lights is 64 - 20 = 44."
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 491."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to first calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy sessions. 

Since John attended sessions twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he chews at school and at home: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum and chews 6 pieces, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Now, subtract the pieces he gave away from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. 

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert 0.67 feet to inches: 0.67 feet * 12 inches per foot = 8 inches.

Now, let's divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price. So, the amount paid by the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit is the selling price minus the cost. Since James sold 10 cars, the total selling price is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. The profit is $250,000 - $75,000 (10 * $7,500) = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Now, we know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so:

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, so T = 16 + 3 = 19.

We know that R = T - 9, so R = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from it.

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $600. 

Let's assume he misses 'x' classes. Then, the total cost of the classes he attends will be (10 - x) classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends should be less than or equal to $600. So, we can set up the inequality:

(10 - x) * $60 <= $600

Now, let's solve for 'x':

(10 - x) * 60 <= 600
600 - 60x <= 600
-60x <= 0
x >= 0

Since 'x' represents the number of classes Manny can miss, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 0.

The final answer is 0."

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms: 
20000 + 2000 = 70x - x 
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69: 
x = 22000 / 69 
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now that we know the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes.

The next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount was 20 * 30 = $600. The discount amount was 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * 600 = $60. So, the final cost for Sheila was 600 - 60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 360 = $180."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, to find the total sales in the first month, we add the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in both months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to get the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert 24 eggs into dozens. To do this, we divide 24 by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

24"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly rent: $5000
Monthly fuel cost: 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year as follows:

Total cost of the plane = Initial cost of the plane + (Monthly rent * 12) + (Monthly fuel cost * 12)
Total cost of the plane = $150,000 + ($5000 * 12) + ($10,000 * 12)
Total cost of the plane = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000
Total cost of the plane = $330,000

Therefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.

330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as R, the time to cook pork as P, and the time to cook beans as B.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

We also know that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50.

Lastly, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so B = (P + R) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40.

Now, to find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to add up the cooking times for each item: Total time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken and the bottle of soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by multiplying 40% by the total number of teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we can find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day by multiplying the number of math teachers by 6 hours.

60 * 6 = 360 hours

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money they have: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

If they decide to share the money equally among themselves, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 12 (first 8) + 3 (next 3) = 15
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 8

Total days = 15 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) = 31

Since there are 31 days in the month, and Christina has 15 good days, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the target height (600 inches) by the growth rate (30 inches per day).

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

The bamboo will reach 600 inches in 20 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs became 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 9 toys. However, he already had 4 toys, so he needs 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 8 (initially bought) + 5 (additional needed) = 13 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, we calculate 2/5 of $1200.

2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

So, Dylan invested $480.

3. Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. We subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount.

$1200 - $480 = $720

4. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We calculate 2/3 of $720.

2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

So, Frances invested $480.

5. To find out how much money is left for Skyler's investment, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.

$720 - $480 = $240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up the number of cookies each of them has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 68 + 5 = 73.

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies: 73 - 12 = 61.

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the Cookie Monster's cookies: 61 + 23 = 84.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y:

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. This gives x = 11, which is a valid age for a twin.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines cost + heartworm check cost). 
Since we don't know the heartworm check cost, let's represent it as x. 
So, 0.6 * (40 + x) = 24 + 0.6x. 
We know that the total bill is $125, so 40 + x + 24 + 0.6x = 125. 
Combine like terms: 64 + 1.6x = 125. 
Subtract 64 from both sides: 1.6x = 61. 
Divide both sides by 1.6: x = 38.125. 
Now we know the heartworm check cost is $38.125.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of regular chairs and high chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
= 40 + 8
= 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, the total number of people is 57. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs
= 57 - 48
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of grandchildren and then multiply it by 3.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, and each of them has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great grand-babies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). Each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. 

Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We also know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. To find out the capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

So, the capacity of Gary's truck is 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: 2,800."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we first need to determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings = 32 + 18
Total dumplings = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying his parts by the total amount of money: 3/5 * $100 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share: $60 - $10 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

Amount still needed = Goal - Amount raised
Amount still needed = $6300 - $2100
Amount still needed = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours = Amount still needed / Hourly amount
Number of hours = $4200 / $700 (since $2100 was raised in 3 hours, the hourly amount is $2100 / 3 = $700)
Number of hours = $4200 / $700
Number of hours = 6

The firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% gives us the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: 68%"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin gets 2 scoops for free. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy, we can divide 4 scoops by 3. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can only buy 1 set of 3 scoops, she can get 2 scoops for free. 

So, Erin should buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops, and get 2 scoops for free.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store would be 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers.

Total amount paid = Number of computers * New price of each computer
= 500 * $770
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes, considering the time her arms were raised and the time they were not.

First, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised. Since her arms were raised for 2 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes, resulting in 2 * 200 = 400 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were not raised. Since her arms were not raised for 3 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes, resulting in 3 * 300 = 900 taps.

Now, we add the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised and when they were not raised to get the total number of taps. 

Total taps = 400 + 900 = 1300

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the extra 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

So, we can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get x = 10.

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Steven's books = 20
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books: 
20 - 16 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

Now, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total cost = $50 + $48 = $98

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball and music is 5 + 10 = 15. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - (10 + 15) = 25.

"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12, which is 4. 

So, 12 - 4 = 8 birds remained in the backyard.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. 

The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Next, we need to find the percentage of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, the remaining percentage of boys is 100% - 40% = 60%.

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by multiplying the total number of students in each class by the percentage of boys.

Number of boys = 40 * 0.6
= 24

The number of boys in each class is 24."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake.
2. Mara added 3 more slices, so now the plate has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She tripled the number of slices, so now the plate has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. Mara ate 2 slices, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

First, let's calculate the total number of animals:

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children. 

The cost for 2 adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52.
The cost for 2 children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24.
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children.

The cost for 2 adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28.
The cost for 2 children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20.
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old and new vendors.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference in cost per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 per day * 7 days per week = $350 per week.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's marbles. 
Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 12 groups, we divide 54 by 12.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

So, we need 5 groups.

The question asks for the number of groups needed to form, but it already states that 12 groups are required. Therefore, the answer is 0."
"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to know the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the monthly total by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of bananas over the three days.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas on the first day, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

On the second day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

Annual cost = $100 * 12 = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the annual cost by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Monthly cost per roommate = $1200 / 4 = $300

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he sent, and then subtract the number of broken ones.

Broken glasses: 10
Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the initial trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. 
So, she has a total of 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

The final answer is 107."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount you'll pay after the discount, you need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

Total number of songs = 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours = 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 or horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * T = 18

To solve for T, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows: 
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = Total cases / 2 = 250 / 2 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * Cases needed by the first house = 2 * 125 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 200 + 90 = 290

Therefore, George has 290 fruits in total."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges will be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read.

300 + 150 = 450

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, but this doesn't change the total number of books they read altogether.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

However, she also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday remain $30.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $65 + $30 = $95.

The final answer is: $95"

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the series and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Now, we can calculate the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the cost of the series and the cost of the older movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies

The speed at which they drove is 50 miles per hour. 
The speed at which they hiked is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
So, the hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know that it took them 1.5 hours to hike. 
Distance = speed * time. 
Distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's assume the number of white fish Bob bought is x.

After adding the new fish to the pond, the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

Since the total number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, the total number of orange fish is 2(4 + x) = 8 + 2x.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond after adding the new fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

Since the total number of fish is 24, we can set up the equation:

3 (initial orange fish) + x (new orange fish) = 8 + 2x (total orange fish)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + x = 8 + 2x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

3 = 8 + x

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

-5 = x

However, the number of fish cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of fish is 24, and the total number of orange fish is 8 + 2x. We also know that the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

Since the total number of fish is 24, we can set up the equation:

(8 + 2x) + (4 + x) = 24

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 + 3x = 24

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:

3x = 12

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by 0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 by 20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = $200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of 200, we multiply 200 by 3/5.

200 * 3/5 = 120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount she had from the twenties.

200 - 120 = $80

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the remaining amount she spent from the twenties.

$35 + $80 = $115

Therefore, Carrie paid $115 for lunch.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount he has from it. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups: 
90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each group had 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and the number of seashells each member brought back:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells.

The final answer is 108."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people: 172
People who got off at the first stop: 47
People who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

People who got off at the next stop: 38
Number of people after the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. So, her special pay for 3 hours is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of male lions + Number of female lions + Number of lion cubs
= 6 + 12 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid to employees after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time taken for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After 20 hours of work, Sally's total earnings will be $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students = 1000 students
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. 
30 - 21 = 9 hours

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. 
10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert 48 quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 18 marshmallows, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

Since they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, they now have 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

To find out how many S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since each S'more requires 2 marshmallows). 14 / 2 = 7.

So, John and DeSean can make 7 S'mores each with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost for each person:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter, which is $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters, which is $0.625 each.

Now, let's add up the total cost: 
- Jack spent $0.25.
- The other three friends spent 3 * $0.625 = $1.875.

Total cost = $0.25 + $1.875 = $2.125.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

Production in the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000

The final answer is 14,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours
Total time spent on makeup in a month: 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6 hours
Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 14 hours

The final answer is: 14"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is:
- 4 mirrors: 4 * $129.00 = $516.00
- 2 shelves: 2 * $129.00 = $258.00
- 1 chandelier: 1 * $129.00 = $129.00
- 10 pictures: 10 * $129.00 = $1290.00

The total cost of the standard items is $516.00 + $258.00 + $129.00 + $1290.00 = $1993.00

Angela needs 6 mirrors, so the additional cost for the mirrors is 6 * $15.00 = $90.00
Angela needs 2 chandeliers, so the additional cost for the chandeliers is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Angela needs 20 pictures, so the additional cost for the pictures is 20 * $15.00 = $300.00

The total cost of the additional items is $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $420.00

The total cost for Angela is the cost of the standard items plus the cost of the additional items: $1993.00 + $420.00 = $2413.00

The final answer is: $2413."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. 

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance traveled = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is:

Speed of each turtle = Speed of kangaroo / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance as 3 kangaroos. Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the ratio of the speeds to find the time. The ratio of the speeds of the kangaroos to the turtles is 3:1. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.

Time taken by 4 turtles = 2 * Time taken by 3 kangaroos
Time taken by 4 turtles = 2 * 18 hours
Time taken by 4 turtles = 36 hours

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 3 x 3 = 9 large slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 small slices.
In total, Adam had 9 + 15 = 24 apple slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract 15 from 24: 24 - 15 = 9.

There are 9 apple slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find the milk production per cow. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. 

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract the current number of cows from the required number of cows. 

15 cows - 3 cows = 12 cows

The farmer needs 12 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total amount spent on water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 

60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 60 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks they have together, we add the number of dishes and socks.

60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 120

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5

Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

So, Brenda will have $1615.28 after 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the total time it would take to clean all the rooms and then divide that by 2.

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. 

Total time to clean all rooms = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2.

Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = B - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. 3B - 1 = A (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3 to get:
3B - 1 = B - 3
2B = 4
B = 2

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age using equation 1:
A = B - 3
A = 2 - 3
A = -1

However, age cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can substitute equation 2 into equation 3 to get:
3B - 1 = S + 2
3B - 3 = S

Now, we can substitute equation 1 into equation 3:
3B - 3 = S
3B - 3 = B - 3
2B = 0
B = 0

This solution is also not valid since age cannot be zero.

Let's try another approach. We can add the three equations:
A + B + S = 87
A = B - 3
A = S + 2
Substituting A in the first equation:
B - 3 + B + S = 87
2B + S = 90

Now, we can substitute A in the second equation:
B - 3 = S + 2
B - S = 5
2B - 2S = 90
2B - 2S = 90
B - S = 45

Now we have two equations:
B - S = 45
B - S = 5

These two equations are the same, which means we have infinite solutions. However, we can express B in terms of S:
B = S + 45

Now, we can substitute B in the first equation:
S + 45 + S = 87
2S + 45 = 87
2S = 42
S = 21

Now that we know my sister's age, we can find my age using equation 2:
A = S + 2
A = 21 + 2
A = 23

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has by adding 12 to Anne's total:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide 120 by 10, which equals 12 boxes.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed (12) by the cost per box ($1.25). The total cost is 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate. 

Her hourly rate is $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the scores from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

Total money from selling chickens = 180 * $50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we can subtract the desired profit from the total money he will make:

Desired profit = $2000
Total money from selling chickens = $9000
Total money needed to make a profit of $2000 = $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Now, we can find out how much Isaias needs to sell each chicken for to make a profit of $2000:

Money per chicken = Total money needed to make a profit of $2000 / Number of chickens to be sold
= $7000 / 180
= $38.89

So, Isaias needs to sell each chicken for at least $38.89 to make a profit of $2000.

The cost of the chicken Isaias bought is not directly calculable with the given information, but we can say that he needs to sell each chicken for at least $38.89 to make a profit of $2000.

$38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

32 glasses / 3 = 10.67 glasses per person

Since we can't sell a fraction of a glass, we can round down to 10 glasses per person. 

Julie sold 14 glasses, so the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales is 14 - 10 = 4 glasses.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's original rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. So, the total amount she has is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she has: $40 - $30 = $10.

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's say the number of years is x. 
So, 8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. So, 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."

So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs.

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. 

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which totals $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she spends on carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find out how much she pays for one carrot, we divide the remaining amount by 2 (since she eats 2 carrots a day). $2 / 2 = $1.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Therefore, Tasha made $54 from mowing lawns.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54 = $26.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. 
We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3. 
Since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 (as you can't have a fraction of a notebook). 
So Joseph had 2 notebooks initially. 

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks. 
Joseph still has 2 notebooks. 
The difference between Martha and Joseph is 12 - 2 = 10."

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is $64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 
Then, we calculate the time for the extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, in 30 days he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs: 3000 / 1000 = 3.

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Total amount spent = $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices they can eat per day.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total available time (8 hours) by the time taken for a round trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

12"
"To find the initial amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be 5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies Colby has seen. He has seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, and 13 movies on this Friday. 

Total movies seen = 5 + 8 + 13 = 26

Since Colby can see 13 more movies with his remaining money, the total number of movies he can see is 26 + 13 = 39.

The final answer is 39."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons: 8 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 23.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 23.

23"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the 24-hour stay.

For the 12-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since he wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost for these additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

For the 24-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had initially: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

The fixed charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor charge is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
The parts charge is $60.

The total cost is the sum of the fixed charge, labor charge, and parts charge: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent this as an equation: 

M = 0.5L

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can represent this as another equation:

M = D - 5

Substituting the value of D (Deanna's age) into the second equation, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

21 = 0.5L

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides by 2:

42 = L

So, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

The total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets of 30 reports

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which is a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to sleep at 10 p.m. So, the total time she usually sleeps is 8 hours. 

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the usual wake-up time. 

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so 5 minutes earlier would be 5:55 a.m. 

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 
12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is 355 minutes. 

Total time she was asleep is 120 + 355 = 475 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom. She woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from 475 minutes. 

475 - 5 = 470 minutes.

The final answer is 470."
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first convert two dozen to the number of cups: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we find 2/3 of 24 cups: 2/3 * 24 = 16 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of measuring spoons and cups: 10 spoons + 24 cups = 34 utensils.

34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

The remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1 email.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we first need to find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of balls each boy picked up. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 1 ball. 

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days and the holes dug on the fourth day. We already know the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day (29), so we can set up the equation:

10 + 13 + 6 + x = 116

Combine the constants:
29 + x = 116

Subtract 29 from both sides:
x = 87

Therefore, the pirates dug 87 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the value of S from the third equation into the second equation to get X = (4A - 13) + 5, which simplifies to X = 4A - 8.

Now we can substitute the values of X and S into the first equation: A + (4A - 8) + (4A - 8) = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 16 = 339.

Add 16 to both sides: 9A = 355.

Divide by 9: A = 39.89 (round down to 39 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(39) - 13 = 155 - 13 = 142.

So Stan has caught 142 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up back at her southern home, we need to consider the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 110 miles south, for a total of 410 miles south from her northern home. 

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the same as the total distance traveled in the southerly direction, which is 410 miles.

The final answer is: 410"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we calculate 75% of 8, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then add them together.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: perimeter = 2(length + width). 

Given that the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
perimeter = 2(25)
perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

total slats = 50 * 2
total slats = 100

The total number of wooden slats Robert will need is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $520

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives D = 48.

We are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2 gives B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the total number of students in each group. 

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each flower plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each flower and the space between them:
- Each flower is 12 inches wide
- There is 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each flower
- Total space required for each flower and the space between them = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space required for each flower and the space between them:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a flower, she can fit 44 flowers in her bed.

Now, calculate the total cost of the flowers:
- Number of flowers Pat can buy = 44
- Cost of each flower = $6
- Total cost = 44 * 6 = $264

The final answer is: $264"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers, 4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
For the carnations, 10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of shoes per year = 0.5

"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute) to get 15 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the peeling time and the cooking time. So, the total time is 15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, let's subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a difference from the initial temperature. Let's call the initial temperature 'x'. 
Final temperature = x - 14 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so we can set up the equation:
x - 14 degrees = x - 2 degrees

Solving for x is not necessary, as we are asked for the difference. The difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature is 14 degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since his dad was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet for the first time, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 90 - 30 = 60 years.

Now, we know that 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and 60 years have passed since Bill saw the comet for the first time. So, the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet is equal to the number of years that have passed since Bill saw the comet for the first time. 

Therefore, 75 = 60 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 75 - 60 = 15.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this accounts for half of the total trips made by the first plane, we can calculate the total number of flights made by the first plane as follows:

Total flights made by the first plane = 2 * 44 = 88 flights

Now, we know that the first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece and the remaining 1/4 is split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. 

Let's denote the number of flights to France as x. Since the remaining 1/4 of the flights is split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to Germany is also x.

We know that the total number of flights made by the first plane is 88, so we can set up the following equation:

3/4 * 88 + x + x = 88

Simplifying the equation:

66 + 2x = 88

Subtracting 66 from both sides:

2x = 22

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in one day."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4).

We also know that the total age of the children is 20, so 3 + 4 + H + W = 20. 

We can simplify the first equation to H = (7 + W) / 2. 

Now, we can substitute H in the second equation: 3 + 4 + (7 + W) / 2 + W = 20. 

Combine like terms: 7 + (7 + W) / 2 + W = 20. 

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 14 + 7 + W + 2W = 40. 

Combine like terms: 21 + 3W = 40. 

Subtract 21 from both sides: 3W = 19. 

Divide both sides by 3: W = 19 / 3. 

W = 6.33."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

First, we find the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies.

Then, we divide the total number of cookies by 2 to find out how many cookies were given to the church: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were in the church: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, the total number of slices is 4.

Now, we know that each adult gets 2 slices, and there are 2 adults. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the total number of chocolate bars in the boxes sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and then divide by the total number of boxes.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 
Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and it is rented 3 days a week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, so the total cost of renting the studio in a month is 12 * $25 = $300.

The dance studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. The total revenue from the students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15. The total revenue from the students in a month is 12 * $15 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total revenue from the students minus the total cost of renting the studio, which is $180 - $300 = -$120. However, since the cost exceeds the revenue, the dance studio would incur a loss of $120 in a month.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Total number of porcupines = Initial number of female porcupines + Total number of babies born in a year
= 30 + 48
= 78

The final answer is 78."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

Cost = Total gallons x cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = 826

The cost to fill the pool will be $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day, we need to calculate the amount each of them pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x + (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x + (0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

Combine like terms:

(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) * x = 0.28

Now, calculate the values:

(0.91)^5 = 0.59049
(0.93)^3 = 0.8577
(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) = 0.59049 * 1.8577 = 1.095

Now, solve for x:

1.095 * x = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 1.095
x = 0.255

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 25.5%."
"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly income and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's price.

First, let's calculate her total weekly income:
- Wages: 40 hours/week * $10/hour = $400/week
- Tips: 40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week
- Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment:
- 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the total amount needed by her weekly income:
- $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total money spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, which means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year and add it to the previous year's price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 6 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

The final answer is 36."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by adding the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other people. 

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since there are 100 eggs in total, and 60 were found by the twins, the remaining eggs are 100 - 60 = 40.

However, it's stated that all the remaining eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day. 

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day. 

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to get the total amount of ore mined in a month, which is 43200 pounds."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2
Total number of blue balloons = 6 (already had) + 2 (added) = 8

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 8
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 0.70

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.70 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To calculate Melissa's total jury pay, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses.

Daily income: $15 per day
Total days: 3 days
Total income: $15 * 3 = $45

Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total parking expenses: $3 * 3 = $9

Total jury pay: $45 - $9 = $36

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage:
Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours
Hourly wage: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find the total number of apples in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box, so in two boxes, there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to get the total amount of fabric needed: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height in inches = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

576.67"
"To find the total hours of work done by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction of the day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 3: 9 hours * 3 = 27 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 27 hours / 4 painters = 6.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 6.75."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * Depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,318
= $12,482

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * Depreciation rate)
= $12,482 - ($12,482 * 0.21)
= $12,482 - $2,618.82
= $9,863.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,863.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed, so he needs to wash 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week. 

Total sets of sheets per week = 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 sets

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do 4 loads per week (2 twin sets and 1 king set).

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
9 sets/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 sets/year

Since he does 4 loads per week, the total number of loads per year is:
468 sets/year / 4 loads/week = 117 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices each person ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10. 
Solving for x, we get x = 7. 
So Jake ate 7 slices. 
Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices. 

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by each person: 
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, which is half of an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The cost of parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

First, we find 20% of 80 emails that don't require a response: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responsive emails from the total:
80 - 16 = 64 emails

Now, we multiply the number of responsive emails by the number of days in a work week (5):
64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 28 - 20 = 8 additional guests. 

The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48. Adding this to the initial fee, the total cost is $125 + $48 = $173."
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first calculate how much money they each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 of her money. If she had $60, then the amount she spent is 1/4 * 60 = 15 dollars.

So, Maggie had 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 of her money. If she had $60, then the amount she spent is 1/3 * 60 = 20 dollars.

So, Riza had 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.

Now, we add the money they have left: 45 + 40 = 85 dollars.

The two of them have 85 dollars left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. So, the total number of pieces he placed in that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75. 

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters. 

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total sales from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total sales from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the total sales from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the total sales from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the arrival of the first train and the departure of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes after the initial time.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. The first train arrives at 30 minutes after the initial time, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes after the initial time. Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 - 30 = 115 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's assume the original price is x.

75% of x = 2000
0.75x = 2000
x = 2000 / 0.75
x = 2666.67

So, the original price of the watch is $2666.67.

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of 2666.67 = 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200

The price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch is $3200.

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price.

Discount = Original price - Selling price
= 2666.67 - 3200
= -533.33

Since the discount is negative, it means the friend actually paid more than the original price. However, we are interested in the percentage discount. To find the percentage discount, we can use the formula:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= (-533.33 / 2666.67) * 100
= -20%

Since the percentage discount is negative, it means the friend paid more than the original price. However, the question asks for the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. In this case, the friend paid more than the original price, so the percentage discount is actually the percentage increase.

Percentage increase = (Selling price - Original price) / Original price * 100
= (3200 - 2666.67) / 2666.67 * 100
= 20%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home. 

The total distance he walked is 2 + 2 = 4 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store and back home."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then the total cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we have already accounted for 150 + 45 = 195 bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 195 = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of MTB price): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on these days. 
1/16 of his weekly minutes are spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
There are 168 minutes in a week (60 minutes * 7 days). 
1/16 of 168 minutes is 10.5 minutes. 
Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, we need to multiply it by 2. 
10.5 minutes * 2 = 21 minutes

Now, we add the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
200 minutes + 21 minutes = 221 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
221 minutes / 60 = 3.68 hours

The final answer is 3.68."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of it, the amount they ate is x/2. So, the amount left after the velociraptors ate is also x - x/2 = x/2.

We know that the amount left after the velociraptors ate is 270 kilograms, so x/2 = 270. Solving for x, we get x = 540 kilograms.

This means that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. Let's call the initial amount 'y'. Since the T-Rex ate half of it, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is y/2 = 540. Solving for y, we get y = 1080 kilograms.

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans remaining.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 cans. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 3 shaken cans left. Then, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken can and 2 unshaken cans. So, there is 1 shaken can left.

Now, Ellen's friend can take either the remaining shaken can or one of the 10 unshaken cans. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans remaining, which is 1/11.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/11) * 100 = 9.09%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, the number of days Billy is available to help is 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

The final answer is 150."

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This also means that the number of large jellyfish that stay blue is x/5 - 6.

Since the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given relationships. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, Ben's age is 2 * 4 = 8 years.
Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years. 

The total amount she needs to save is her annual savings multiplied by the number of years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. 

Assuming she has been working for 0 years, she needs to work for 60 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: 60"

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

Now, let's add the total costs together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume he is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Increase in temperature = 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature

The temperature in the morning was 5 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. So, the total amount she spent on the books is $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 5
Difference: 8 - 5 = 3

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total distance for one trip: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance for one trip by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift.

Let's calculate the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
Since the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys in 10 hours. 
The fifth worker needs to produce 20 toys in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
So, the fifth worker produces 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight. Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris after using half of his stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5 to find the 2nd fastest car's speed.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 by 16 to get 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces, which is also 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the amount of water in each mug is not specified. However, we can use the information about the temperature to infer the amount of water in each mug.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Let's assume the unknown mug has x ounces of water. We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water (since 4 ounces were poured from it). 

The total amount of water Donny has is 5 ounces, so the amount of water in the unknown mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the unknown mug has 1 ounce of water and its temperature is unknown. We also know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. 

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown mug, the temperature of the water in the unknown mug must be at least 33 degrees. 

However, we cannot determine the exact temperature of the unknown mug, as it could be any temperature above 33 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals = 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 3 potatoes. 

So, 18 scoops of mashed potatoes can be made from 18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he consumes 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, he eats 5 eggs a day, so he consumes 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. 

Since Carlos collected 5 more seashells than Jim, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by adding 5 to Jim's total. 

Carlos collected 27 + 5 = 32 seashells.

We are also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, to find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we divide Carlos' total by 2.

Carrey collected 32 / 2 = 16 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally. 

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 32 (Carlos) + 16 (Carrey) = 75 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 75 / 3 = 25 seashells.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand.

460 bottles (required) - 4200 (available) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is not possible as Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles. This means that Hortex can't meet the energy demand of 2300 people with the current production capacity.

The answer is: 3740"
"To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearing babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple-wearing babies with bows and the blue-wearing babies with bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue-wearing babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by all of them: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, and 27 eggs have been found, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (7 * 2450) - 200 = 10 * 17150 - 200 = 171500 - 200 = 171300 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years and the 10th year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 171300 + 1000 = 235700

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get: 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting the second equation into the previous equation, we get: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and she gave $3 to her sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

5 - 3 = $2

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as 'x'. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is divided into red, white, and purple. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the paint used for the yellow half and the paint used for the other half. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12 (since the other half is divided into 3 colors, each with 'x' amount)

Combine like terms: 4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 'x', which is 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs $12. We want to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. 

To do this, we can divide the total cost of the new box ($12) by the cost per cycle ($1) and then divide the number of pods in the new box (120) by the number of pods per cycle (1).

Number of cycles = Total cost / Cost per cycle
= $12 / $1
= 12 cycles

However, we also need to consider the number of pods in the new box. 

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Number of pods per cycle
= 120 / 1
= 120 cycles

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we can run 120 cycles with the new box for $1, but we would have 20 pods left over."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches, he has already recycled 2.25 - 2 = 0.25 inches of chalk.

Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left. 
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk, we can divide the remaining chalk by 20% (or 0.2).

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days.

The teacher has 13 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the value of W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's calculate the net rate of building snowballs per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt in the same hour. So, the net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by the net rate (12 snowballs per hour). 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

It will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400."
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. 

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation based on the given information is 4x + 8 = 40.

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'x':
4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
5/11 * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the first floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the roof minus the height of the second floor, which is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, since we can't have a negative height, we need to reconsider our approach.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received and then subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate 40% of the house's value: 
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Then, we calculate 60% of the loan amount to find out how much he used to pay off his debts:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount to find the leftover amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the total amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $275 + $6 = $281

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. Half of 10 diapers is 10 / 2 = 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the total number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

Given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, Tim's guess was 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans off."
"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop.

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, we need to find the number of people who entered at the second station. Since 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first stop entered at the second station, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30

So, 30 people entered at the second station.

Total number of people after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

Now, the number of people on the bus doubled at the third station. To find the number of people on the bus after the third stop, we multiply the total number of people after the second stop by 2.

Number of people after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, we need to find the remaining spaces on the bus.

Remaining spaces on the bus = 200 - 180 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. So, the total number of visits is 3 * 5 = 15.

The cost of one visit increased by 150%, so the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 5 dollars.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. So, the total number of visits is 3 * 3 = 9.

The total cost for the first 5 years is 15 * 2 = 30 dollars.
The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 * 5 = 45 dollars.

The total cost of all visits is 30 + 45 = 75 dollars.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since there are 3 grades (4-7), the total number of students is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 30 / 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't use the full 45 minutes, we'll assume they'll use the remaining time in the next group.

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds needed by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric required = 2 * Total width
Total fabric required = 2 * 175
Total fabric required = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday. 

Rain on Monday = 2 inches
Twice the amount of rain on Monday = 2 * 2 = 4 inches

It is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total, so we add 1 inch to the result.

Total rain on Tuesday = 4 + 1 = 5 inches"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. 

Since Karen is getting both services, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services. 

First, we find the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, we calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of nail art to the discounted total: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initially, the price in November was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%, so the new price is:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so the new price is:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% less than the standard rate, we can calculate it as follows:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the original number of pomelos as x. Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, the number of pomelos she has now is (1/4)x.

We know that Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos, so we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Now that we know Eve originally had 80 pomelos, we can find out how many she gave away by subtracting the number of pomelos she has now from the original amount:

80 - (1/4)80
80 - 20
60

Eve gave away 60 pomelos."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total number of apples.

3/5 of 60 apples = (3/5) * 60 = 36 apples

Walter had 36 apples left after eating 2/5 of them.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The total amount of money Walter received = 27 apples * $3/apple = $81.

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, he traveled for 3 days, which is 72 hours. 

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many as she did, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

So, the total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. 

The total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we add the grapes used by the brother and Madeline to the grapes used by the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. So, the total weekly cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the total number of books can be represented as:

B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

(3B/2) - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

3B/2 = 115

Multiply both sides by 2:

3B = 230

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 76.67

Since the number of books must be a whole number, we can round down to 76 books for the bottom shelf.

Now, we can calculate the number of books for each shelf:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelf: 76/2 = 38 books
Top shelf: 76 - 5 = 71 books

Now, we can calculate the total number of books per bookcase:

Bottom shelf: 76 books / 1 shelf = 76 books per bookcase
Middle shelf: 38 books / 1 shelf = 38 books per bookcase
Top shelf: 71 books / 1 shelf = 71 books per bookcase

Since the top shelf has the most books, we need at least 3 bookcases to hold all the books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats from the remaining hats. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 70) + (40)
Total questions = (0.7 * 70) + 40
Total questions = 49 + 40
Total questions = 89

Now, we can calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in the first test:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test as follows:

Questions correct in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions correct in the second test = 89 - 42
Questions correct in the second test = 47

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 47 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent it as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes should be equal to 116. 

The equation can be written as: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the equation 5s - 4: 
5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of rooms with small candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of rooms with medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4

Total number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Total number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. So, the total number of flashlights = 4

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 (candles) + 4 (flashlights) = 40

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete all six sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week. 

Since he spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he spends 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day on calls.

In a 5-day work week, he spends 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes on calls.

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is 1800 / 15 = 120.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time. Therefore, the total time it takes Phineas to return home is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

Therefore, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM, and after training, it's 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 hours.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people is twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 1/4 * 40 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 1 gallon requires 6 lemons. 

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

So, the total number of lemons required is 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.

42"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption of dog food is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

There are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets: 
- 2 adult tickets = 2 * $12 = $24
- 1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of the popcorns: 
- 2 popcorns = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:
Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

The family pays a total of $38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

First, let's add up the total number of seashells found:
214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Now, let's subtract the number of cracked seashells:
732 (total seashells) - 67 (cracked seashells) = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 6 = $72.00.

For the bowls, she needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 5 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 4 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to complete the puzzle, which is given as 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Now, we add 2 hours to this half to find Anna's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

"To find out how much feed Dexter has left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs will consume 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs John will serve and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

The final answer is 16."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making the total 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making the total 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 = 40 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

40 - 5 = 35

The final answer is 35."

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now, we know the ages of both brothers (12 and 24) and the ages of the sisters (16 each). 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all the siblings: 

12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, so she spends 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the first T-shirt costs $8. The second T-shirt costs 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. 

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. 

The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. 

$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is 72."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (the original number of beakers requested, 7, minus the number he gathered, 5).

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 * 2 = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws initially. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the initial number of screws: 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can calculate the time she took to run 4 miles as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can calculate the distance he ran as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance she ran would be 2 * 16x = 32x.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is half of the distance Aaron ran. So, we can set up the equation:

32x / 2 = 4
32x = 8
x = 8 / 32
x = 1/4

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can calculate Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/4)
Time = 8 * 4
Time = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required length to find out how much more he needs to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to first calculate the daily revenue. 

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10, and the cost of wine is $5. 

So, the daily revenue is 6 * ($10 + $5) = 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is 2 * $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit percentage is 25%, we can calculate the cost price of one watermelon as follows:

Let's assume the cost price of one watermelon is x.
The total cost of 50 watermelons is 50x.
The selling price of 50 watermelons is 50x + 25% of 50x, which is 50x + 12.5x = 62.5x.

Since the total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, we can set up the equation:
50x = 80
x = 80 / 50
x = 1.6

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon:
Selling price = 62.5x
= 62.5 * 1.6
= 100

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. 

We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. 

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to get c + 15 = 20. 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get c = 5.

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
