"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll round down to 3 muffins).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she has left after baking: 13 - 3 = 10 eggs.

She sells the remaining 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original value.

First, find 150% of $80,000: 
150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Now, add the original value to this amount:
$120,000 + $80,000 = $200,000

The profit is the new value minus the original purchase price:
$200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000

The profit Josh made is $120,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 sessions * 3 sprints/session = 9 sprints.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he runs in a week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed given so far is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups per chicken.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed given so far is 2 * 20 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them 40 cups of feed, the amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 3 - 2 = 1 cup per chicken.

The total amount of feed needed for the final meal is 1 * 20 = 20 cups.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. 

To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial investment. We need to consider the first year when the tree starts producing lemons. In the first year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, but it won't generate any net profit because the cost of the tree is not yet covered.

So, we need to add 1 to the result: 12 years + 1 year = 13 years

Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Now, we multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling at the same time and in the same direction, they will cover the same distance.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, they cover the same distance.

So, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts: 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual earnings from teaching: 20 * 35 * 50 = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual earnings from coaching: 30 * 15 * 50 = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 336 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 336 / 12 = 28.

So, Claire will eat 28 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent walking so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent walking so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the total distance is 12 miles, and we want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Let's denote the time she needs to spend walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be 2 hours (time spent walking the first 6 miles) + t hours.

Total Distance = 12 miles
Total Time = 2 + t

We can set up the equation: 12 / (2 + t) = 4

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t):
12 = 4(2 + t)
12 = 8 + 4t
Subtract 8 from both sides:
4 = 4t
Divide both sides by 4:
1 = t

Now that we know the time Marissa needs to spend walking the remaining distance, we can find the required speed. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

Required speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 6 / 1
= 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 29/3 - 1 = 26/3 liters.

Now, we need to add the remaining amount of the orange drink to the 24 liters of the pineapple drink. Since the total amount of liquid is 24 liters, we can set up the equation: 24 + x = 10 + 15, where x is the amount of the orange drink left. Solving for x, we get x = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the remaining orange drink to the total amount of water in the pineapple drink: 9 + 9 = 18 liters.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 
4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the price he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can express this as 0.75x = 19.50.

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75.

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The remaining distance after his first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance he traveled after his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled after the second stop from the distance traveled before the second stop: 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day. 

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money John has:
$195 - $160 = $35

John has $35 left. Since he started with $195, we can subtract the amount he has left from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on the video games:
$195 - $35 = $160

Now, we know John spent $160 on the video games. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we can divide the amount he spent on the video games by the price of each Lego set:
$160 / $15 per set = 10.67 sets

Since John can't sell a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that he has $5 left, which means he didn't sell all his sets. 

Let's recalculate the number of sets he sold:
$195 - $160 = $35, and he has $5 left, so he must have sold 10 sets.

Now, we know John sold 10 sets. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets:
13 - 10 = 3

John still has 3 Lego sets."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 60 miles
- Day 2: 60 / 2 = 30 miles
- Day 3: 30 miles
Total distance run per week: 60 + 30 + 30 = 120 miles

Time spent running per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total time spent running per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's average running speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 20 miles per hour

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. 

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is:
20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles * 1 pound/candle = 20 pounds of beeswax
The cost of the beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the beeswax is:
20 pounds * $10.00/pound = $200.00
Adding the cost of the wicks, the total cost is:
$200.00 + $10.00 = $210.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $210.00
Net profit = -$170.00

The net profit is -$170.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. 

The total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 300 - 23 = 277.

277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000. 

5% of $1,000,000 is $50,000. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $50,000.

The total annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the two parts: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.

10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half is:

$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the total amounts paid for the first half and the second half to find the total amount paid for the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. Since she put in 4 gallons to fill the 12-gallon tank, we subtract 4 from 12 to get 8 gallons left in the tank.

Now, we can divide the remaining gas in the tank (8 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons) to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank. 

8 / 4 = 2

So, Sophia can drive 2 miles per gallon. 

To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

2 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 24 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 24 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he will spend 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for the first month will be 2% of $150, which is $3. 

The total amount to be paid for the first month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

For the second month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3. The total amount to be paid for the second month is $150 + $3 = $153.

For the third month, the interest will be 2% of $150, which is $3. The total amount to be paid for the third month is $150 + $3 = $153.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 to find out how many bags Cecilia will use in the first year.

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can write the equation as 0.5 * 400 = 200. 

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6."

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x: x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

The final answer is: $1169.23"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Cindy has four pets.

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's pets by adding 2 to Cindy's total: 4 + 2 = 6.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so we multiply Marcia's total by 3: 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we add up the total number of pets for all three: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

We know that Lee's speed is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's speed is x + 2. We also know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can find his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 1.1 times his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 9.22 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 
9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes.

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce she made is half of x, which is 32 ounces. 

So, we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 32

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 64

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we divide the total number of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3: 4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. 

In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes 'x'. 

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. 

We also know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 'x + 20 - 5'. 

Since the total number of cars on the motorway is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20 - 5) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 15 = 30

Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 15

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a car, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the question asks for the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 7."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

She currently has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she currently has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 
98 - 40 = 58

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Science textbook: 4 pages
Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
History textbook: 7 pages
Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the pages left by the number of days.

Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses from weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Total Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes
Time = 14 minutes

The fog bank will take 14 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has already placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3, since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats: 5 + 15 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because Frankie watched some episodes on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday and the 30-minute episode on Thursday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 4 - 1.5 - 2 = 0 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

First, we need to find Julia's rowing speed. We know she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total distance Julia will row, we need to divide the total time it takes her to reach the shore by her rowing speed.

Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Time to row 20 feet = 16 seconds
Time to row the remaining distance = Total time - Time to row 20 feet
Time to row the remaining distance = 64 - 16
Time to row the remaining distance = 48 seconds

Now, we can find the remaining distance:
Remaining distance = Speed * Time to row the remaining distance
Remaining distance = 1.25 feet/second * 48 seconds
Remaining distance = 60 feet

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rowed:
Total distance = Distance rowed initially + Remaining distance
Total distance = 20 feet + 60 feet
Total distance = 80 feet

Now, we can find the total amount of water the boat took on:
Total water = (Total distance / 10) * 2 liters
Total water = (80 feet / 10) * 2 liters
Total water = 16 liters

The boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons per day and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's represent the number of ducks in the photograph as 'x'. 

So, we can set up the equation: 300 = 50x.

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 50.

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of each type of board. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total amount of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $55,769

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $55,769
= $128,569

The final answer is: $128,569"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, the pile of already-stamped letters had 30 letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters Jennie put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = 30 - 20 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B. Then, the number of worker bees is 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Then, B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation for worker bees: 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. Since the total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens, we can write the equation: 4Q + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 45 bees had returned before this point. So, 60 - 45 = 15 bees from the second wave of bees that left have returned.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before the second wave (which is 30 bees) return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 15 (from the second wave) + 30 (from the first wave) = 45 bees.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

Steve's time: Distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet. 
Speed = 440 feet/minute. 
Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's time: Distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. 
Speed = 264 feet/minute. 
Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 
The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate are 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Since we can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull ate. We'll correct this in the next step.
6. Let's re-evaluate the situation: the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries, but we know that the pigeons can't eat more fries than were left after the seagull ate. So, the pigeons must have eaten 3 fries, and the seagull ate 7 fries, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 fries.
7. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 4 = 8/3 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 2 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
8. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 4 - 2 = 2 fries.
9. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 2 - 1 = 1 fry.
10. Since 1 fry is left, and Dave ate 14 fries initially, the pack must have had 14 + 1 = 15 fries.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
For Tuesdays and Thursdays: 8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Total hours = 144 + 128 = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
So, she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's total distance from Kelly's total distance.
6120 yards - 1500 yards = 4620 yards

The winner, Kelly, ran 4620 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial count: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the count: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday first. 

The tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth on Wednesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Cost after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Cost after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Cost after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Cost after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Cost after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Cost after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of all the toys is the sum of the costs of the red cars, the doll, and the action figures. So, the total cost is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. If she loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she loses $35/hour, her lost income would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income:

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28. Combining like terms, we get 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we get B = 8.

Since S = 2B, we can find Seth's current age by multiplying B by 2: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the total miles he walks on the weekend.

From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 days in this period, so the total miles walked is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate their total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's calculate their total cost. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they made $35 in revenue, their total cost is $35 - $25 = $10.

Since they made $10 in total cost and they make $5 in cost per gallon, they must have made 10 / 5 = 2 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. They made 2 gallons and spend $3 for lemons per gallon. So, the total cost of lemons is 2 * $3 = $6.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these amounts from Zaid's total salary: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount:

The final amount Zaid will have is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the number of white carnations. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40. 

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * 40 = 160.

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: E = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's current age by adding 2 to Mark's age: E = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 seconds per runner, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0 * 100) = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to calculate the total straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so the total straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 pieces. 

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for rabbits is 20 pieces.

The total straw used among the small rodents is 160 pieces. We subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from this total to find the straw used for the rats: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage: 90 / 6 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 rats in each cage.

The final answer is: 15"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest for 1 month is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 * $100 = $2. 

Since Mandy paid after 3 months, the total interest is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The total amount Mandy needs to pay is the initial amount plus the interest, which is $100 + $6 = $106.

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Since the cost per bag for transportation is $2, we can find the number of bags transported:
Number of bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags transported = $140 / $2
Number of bags transported = 70

However, this is the number of bags transported, not the total number of bags sold. Since the trader bought the bags from the farmer, the number of bags transported is equal to the number of bags sold. 

So, the trader sold 13 bags.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed: 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week: 7

Daily amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds / 7 days
Daily amount of insects needed = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years, he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 new trees.

However, he also chops down 2 trees a year, so he will have chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The total number of trees he has after 10 years is the sum of the initial trees, the trees he planted, and the trees he chopped down. 

So, the total number of trees is 50 + 100 - 20 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which is 39.

The number of trees that die is 39.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is 91."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has, which is $20. So, $20 - $10 = $10.

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots available.

Total carrots available = 200 pounds
Total carrots distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Carrots not used = Total carrots available - Total carrots distributed
Carrots not used = 200 pounds - 80 pounds
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them together.

In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add the cards collected each month: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

The final answer is: $104,500."
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre and then by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The total cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates, we can set up an equation:

Total cost of 6 plates - $1200 = Total cost of 240 cups

Total cost of 6 plates = $6000 + $1200
Total cost of 6 plates = $7200

Now, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of 240 cups by 240:

Cost of one cup = Total cost of 240 cups / 240
Cost of one cup = $7200 / 240
Cost of one cup = $30

The total cost of buying each cup is $30."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4). 

$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since Sara needs to earn more from babysitting than from lawn mowing, we can conclude that she needs to babysit 12 times and mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width). 

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

Third day customers = x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

The final answer is 183."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express x as x = 4y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 16 = 0

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4y = -16

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -4

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can start by setting up the correct equation for the amount of water in the small pool:

x - 16 = y

We also know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

Substituting x - 16 for y in the second equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Add 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 24

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she will return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we can add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3

Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, which is 30 liters. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and then add it to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the cost of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

The upgrade adds $3.00 to the total cost.
Total cost so far: $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total cost.
Total amount owed: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle:

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 / 60 = 1 hour

"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many melons were remaining, we subtract the initial number of harvested melons from the total.

Remaining melons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining melons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many melons were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of harvested melons from the remaining melons.

Melons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, let's add up the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The total cost for Mark is $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are only sold in 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices needed by 8: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

In addition to the 25 new pens, Ram already has the 25 pens he bought initially. So, the total number of pens he has is:

25 (initial pens) + 25 (new pens) = 50 pens

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has: 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's amount: 27 + 6 = 33.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' amount from John's amount: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's collection, and 2 books from her own collection. 
Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's collection, and 1 book from her own collection.

So, the total number of books they will collectively read is: 
- Dolly: 2 (from her own) + 2 (from Pandora) = 4 books
- Pandora: 1 (from Dolly) + 1 (from her own) = 2 books

Total books collectively read: 4 (Dolly) + 2 (Pandora) = 6 books

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes per week. 

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Tuesday by 2.
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can find the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister.
Difference in cookies = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the difference in calories by multiplying the difference in cookies by 200.
Difference in calories = 28 * 200 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 * 20 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

4 times 21 is 4 * 21 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that termites ate. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money the girls have combined is $400."
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the selling price:
Total amount paid = $400,000 + $12,000 + $20,000 = $432,000

Finally, let's subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $432,000 = -$32,000

However, since Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount, we need to subtract this amount from the net proceeds:
Net proceeds = -$32,000 - $250,000 = -$282,000

The net proceeds from selling the house is -$282,000."
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall total:
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2 to find the number of golf balls.

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows.

Next, we add the additional windows in each house: 4 windows per house. So, 12 windows from the bedrooms + 4 windows per house = 16 windows.

Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows by 2 to get the total number of windows between the houses: 16 windows * 2 houses = 32 windows.

"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

3200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter D: 5/8 of the remaining 24 = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 15."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is 180."
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in a necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches.

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and then add them up.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.

In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.

In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories written by each child in both weeks:

Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of stories written: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360

The total number of stories written altogether is 360."

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
It has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 5-star rows. Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 + 5x. 

Since the total number of stars on a 76-star flag is 76, we can set up the equation: 
24 + 12 + 5x = 76 
36 + 5x = 76 
5x = 40 
x = 8 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. 

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount Susan earns, we need to first determine the total time she worked. 

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she paused for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she earns: 150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day. 

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total number of crates he sold from his target to find the difference.

120 (target) - 65 (total sold) = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made after the initial bid is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids are $200 (initial bid) + $50 (first increment) = $250, $300, $350, and $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 (initial bid) + $250 + $300 + $350 = $800.

The desk costs Carmen $800."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1,800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1,800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by the weight lost per week.

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight lost per week
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 2 pounds
Number of weeks = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can see a pattern. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, he has to spend $4000 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who could attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 45 / 3 = 15.

Since x represents the number of electric poles, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we can subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men and add the number of people who left.

Number of men who left = 1/4 * 25 = 6.25 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 6 = 19

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.

Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Number of men who stayed
= 40 - 19
= 21

Therefore, 21 women are left at the party.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's represent the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

Since the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can assume that each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. 

So, the total number of old records traded is 5 people * 2 old records/person = 10 old records.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $184000."
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. 

At the second stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people remaining is 20 - 7 = 13.
At the first stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 + 5 = 18.

Therefore, 18 people got on the bus at the terminal.

5. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Oscar has 31 lollipops."
"To find the total time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which is the number of ruined castles, and then divide that by 2, since half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of 88 is 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100."
"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
Value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
Value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens would be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of chickens * 2) + (number of cows * 4)
Total number of legs = (40 * 2) + (20 * 4)
Total number of legs = 80 + 80
Total number of legs = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has, we need to consider the number of balls he started with and the number he added each week. 

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

3 (initial balls) + 1 (first week) + 1 (second week) + 1 (third week) + 1 (fourth week) = 7

So, Josh has 7 balls to juggle on stage."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"

Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day after taking his coach's advice and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Initially, Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. So, the new distance he runs per day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately.

The tables with 4 legs have 40 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 40 * 4 = 160.

The tables with 3 legs have 50 tables, so the total number of legs from these tables is 50 * 3 = 150.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the difference in daily revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the weekly expenditure and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly expenditure on food = $25

Total weekly expenditure = $25 + $20 + $25 = $70

Total monthly expenditure = $70 * 4 = $280

Total yearly expenditure = $280 * 12 = $3360"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means she needs 30 * 2 = 60 pots for the roses. 

The total number of pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 pots.

Since April already had 100 pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea had $36 initially.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 30% of total time = 15 hours.

Let's convert the percentage to a decimal: 30% = 0.3.

Now, we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15.

To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the cost per person includes the cost of one round of mini-golf ($5) and 2 go-kart rides ($20). 

Cost per person = $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (2 go-kart rides) = $25

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find the number of friends Morgan can invite:
$60 / $25 = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, the amount she saves in her piggy bank per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 in change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy he bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

1.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time = Distance / Speed = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Then, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for each part of the trip:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5), the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10), and the number of people kicked out for physical violence (3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30).

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

Since Sara scored 8 points, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before. 

The final answer is 4.67"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of the original wallpaper.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, so it was 1 * 2 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add the hours together: 
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 40% of x, which is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = (number of functioning pieces) * price per piece

We know that the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

Let's assume the price per piece is y. Then, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = 0.6x * y

However, we don't know the price per piece (y). We can express y in terms of x:

y = 400,000 / 0.6x

Now, we can find the total amount spent on functioning pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x * (400,000 / 0.6x)
= 400,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is $400,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 / $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, we can add up the number of apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine how many socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies initially: 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away: 65 + 44 = 109

Now, let's subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 109 = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that there are not enough cookies to cover the total number of cookies eaten or given away. However, if we consider the initial number of cookies and the number of cookies given by Janet, we can calculate the number of cookies left.

Cookies left: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies eaten or given away: 44

Cookies left: 65 - 44 = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for calculating monthly interest is: 
Monthly interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 12

Given values: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Monthly interest = (3650 * 0.10 * 5) / 12
Monthly interest = 146.88

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we add the monthly interest to the principal amount to get the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Principal + Monthly interest
Monthly payment = 3650 + 146.88
Monthly payment = 3796.88

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3796.88."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Total silver = 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150
Total gold = 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x: 
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

32"
"To find the initial number of girls in the choir, we can calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. Since the choir is performing with just its female members, the number of girls performing is 26.

However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the 26 girls will not be performing. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls won't be performing.

The choir's 3 teachers will also be performing. Therefore, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts: 165 / 11 = 15.

Then, we multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio:
- Betty's popsicles: 15 * 5 = 75
- Sam's popsicles: 15 * 6 = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services without the discount. 

Netflix costs $10 a month.
Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate the discount amount for the Hulu and Disney Plus bundle.

The discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the discounted cost of the Hulu and Disney Plus bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services: $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 a month.

To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 (cable) - $26 (streaming) = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by canceling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2142857 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 21.42857%

The final answer is 21.43%"

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she initially had is 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

She received 17 cards from family and friends. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica now has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards given away: -29

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new daily usage: 
7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy saved in 30 days: 
4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135,000 watts

Converting this to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of ingredients needed as follows:

Total people / people per sandwich = total sandwiches
20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost = cost of meat + cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new total of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 60 = 160."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of these items is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog):
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Then, we find 1% of the defective candles (will explode):
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister's T = 2 * 30 = 60.

We also know that her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister's S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A = 500

Combine the constants:

45 + A = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:

A = 455

So, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 455"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet) and the elevation where the comb landed (6,000 feet). 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total capital = Initial capital + Amount received from the first bank + Amount received from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $14,000

The final answer is: 14000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add up the costs for all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: $424"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 6) = (1/3)x - 2. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6) = (2/3)x + 4.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x = 8

However, this would mean the jogger jeans cost the same as the tattered jeans, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 3x + 30 + 3x
= 6x + 30

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't determine the exact number of birds. However, we can express the total number of birds as 6x + 30.

The final answer is: 6x + 30"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he sells 2/3 of the cards, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

Since he gets $1 from selling 2/3 of the cards, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * $1.5 = $1

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

2/3 * $1.5 = $1
$1 = $1

This equation is true, but it doesn't help us find 'x'. We need to use the fact that Kenny has $150 after selling the cards. 

Let's set up the equation:

2/3 * $1.5 * x = $150

Solving for 'x':

2/3 * $1.5 * x = $150
$1 * x = $150
x = $150 / $1
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total guests = 36
Hotdogs per guest for half of the guests = 2
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total hotdogs needed - Total hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which equals 7. 

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon to get the total pints needed. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means that 5 cents is 1% of the total money George had initially. Now, we can set up an equation to find out how much money George spent on candy bars:

Money spent on candy bars = Total money - Money left
Money spent on candy bars = 500 - 5
Money spent on candy bars = 495 cents

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the money spent on candy bars by 75 to find out how many candy bars George bought:

Number of candy bars = Money spent on candy bars / 75
Number of candy bars = 495 / 75
Number of candy bars = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and beef stock needed.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Since each pound costs $2.00, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 1*20 + 2*20 = 1 + 40 = 41 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 3*20 + 4*20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 41 = 99.

The final answer is: 99"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking:
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours = 3
Total temperature increase = 5 * 3 = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees per 10 minutes
Time the window is open = 30 minutes
Number of 10-minute intervals = 30 / 10 = 3
Total cooling effect = 2 * 3 = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase:
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Cooling effect
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so James' swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' total time by adding his times for each segment: 36 + 85 + 60 = 181 minutes.

The final answer is: 181"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, we can calculate the total cost of the hay as follows: 
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail 
Total cost of hay = 16 * 0.5 * 3 
Total cost of hay = 24 dollars 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has: 
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay 
Change = 30 dollars - 24 dollars 
Change = 6 dollars

"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman initially spent $576 on the case of sneakers. 
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576

"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. So, the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $20 - $3 = $17.

We are also given that buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price saves $2. This means that the cost of the popcorn and the soda together is $12 + $2 = $14.

Since we know the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $17, and the total cost of the popcorn and soda together is $14, we can set up the equation:

17 = P + S

We also know that the soda costs $3, so we can substitute S = $3 into the equation:

17 = P + 3

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 17 - 3
P = 14

So, the regular price of popcorn is $14.

"To find the original cost per balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons. 

Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Original cost per balloon = $45

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price.

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = $65 * 170
Total cost = $11,050

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can solve for total_students in the second equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20
total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of students with desktop computers:

3/4 * total_students = 3/4 * 80
students_with_computers = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to each substance to avoid double counting:

Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids in the class - Total number of kids allergic to at least one substance
= 32 - 12
= 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since there are four horses and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, the total daily consumption is 4 * 5 = 20 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day, the total daily consumption is 20 * 2 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of oats are required to meet this amount. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will pay for only 1 pack. 

The total cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine the number of guests required for both venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The total cost for the first venue is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The total cost for the second venue is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

To find the point at which both venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, Mark needs 10 guests for both venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of insects each person found. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by each person is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For the 2 x 4 lumber, he can get 200 sticks, and it costs $4. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8 lumber, he can get 400 sticks, and it costs $6. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, the 2 x 8 lumber is the cheapest option. 

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood, as 2 x 4 pieces would only yield 400 sticks, which is less than the 800 sticks he can get from 4 2 x 8 pieces.

4 2 x 8 pieces of wood will cost 4 x $6 = $24, which is the amount he has.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose the weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of days: 
August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October (31 days) + November (30 days) + December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 or 29 days, depending on the year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 308 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total number of days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 308 days
Daily calorie deficit ≈ 340 calories

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 340 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday."

"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

So far, Chris has completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, Chris completed 13 problems on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of problems completed: 48 + 13 = 61.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we subtract the total problems completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, subtract the number of loaves sold: 200 - 93 = 107
Then, add the number of loaves returned: 107 + 6 = 113

The bakery had 113 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller number of rows. In this case, the blue tulips will limit the number of rows to 3.

Jackson will plant 3 rows of flowers.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies. 

First, we need to convert the fraction 3/4 into a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75 cups.

Now, we divide the total number of raisins (27 cups) by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies (0.75 cups): 

27 cups / 0.75 cups per batch = 36 batches

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Now, we need to find the rate at which 5 people paint the house. Since the rate is additive, we can multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

1 day"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas. We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86

The total number of sofas and chairs is 86."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

Number of CDs = Total amount spent on headphones / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week and the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks - 2 weeks with 5 hours). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Total cost of computer and printer / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,800 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $900

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. So, 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To calculate the total amount you paid, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left, which is $13. So, he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is 39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 / 15 days (first half of April) = $75 per day

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 * 2 = $150 per day

So, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of April to hit his target.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. The total amount of money is the sum of what Jeff and Brad get, which is x + 4x = 5x. We know this sum is equal to 100 dollars. 

So, 5x = 100. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 20. 

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, the commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Twice the time on a cold day is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes per mile. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100). The total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60. 

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35.

So, the number of goals scored by each teenager is as follows:
- Richie: 80
- Mark: 60
- Anna: 35

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter had $70. After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he had $70 - $20 = $50 left. Then, he spent $6 on plastic action figures, leaving him with $50 - $6 = $44.

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy is $44 / $2 = 22.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures. Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 22 = 26.

"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply in a month and then subtract the total number of roses he grows in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

Ford grows 40 roses per week. 
Total roses in a month = 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Total roses ordered in a month = 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses ordered in a month.
Roses lacking = Total roses ordered in a month - Total roses grown in a month
Roses lacking = 260 - 160
Roses lacking = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

Total amount removed = $100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves used + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the number of loaves used is equal to the number of sandwiches sold, which is 10.
Total cost = $3.00 per loaf * 10 loaves + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the selling price of each muffin crayon: 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then the total cost of the materials and labor.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide by the number of days.

Let's calculate the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The resulting value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
450 * 1.04 = 468

However, the actual temperature is 468, so we need to find the temperature that is 4% lower than the actual temperature. 
468 * 0.96 = 447.12

So, Maggie should set the oven to 447.12 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies to minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she must have brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 45 = $4.00 per pair

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate their earnings:
Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

So, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends, so the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 invited people, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 100 + 200 + 20 = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

- 14 nickels = 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total value of the coins:
$2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
$3.45 / $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to first find out how many times it rotates in a month. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it will rotate 725 * 2 = 1450 times per mile. 

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tire will rotate 1450 * 400 = 580,000 times per month.

To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12. 
580,000 * 12 = 6,960,000 times per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

To do this, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year. 
10,440,000 / 6,960,000 = 1.5 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost: $52.50 * 0.30 = $15.75.

Now, we subtract the total cost and sales tax from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $52.50 - $15.75 = -$17.25.

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $17.25.

Final answer: $-17.25"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the difference in cost, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Monica's street: 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100
Cost of repaving Lewis' street: 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250
- Month 10: $757,812.50

Now, we add up the funding for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,812.50 = $2,380,562.50

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,380,562.50 = $2,880,562.50

The final answer is: $2,880,562.50"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93."
"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons of water used in a year by the cost per gallon: 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. 

Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the entire bull.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days.

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of occupied seats by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats after removing the seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

There are 6 poles at each intersection, and there are 4 intersections. So, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76."
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he chews at school and at home: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

Jim starts with 20 pieces and chews 6, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Now, subtract the pieces he gave away from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. 

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert 0.67 feet to inches: 0.67 feet * 12 inches per foot = 8 inches.

Now, let's divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

First, we find 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 women who can stay upright.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 10 = 15 men.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we subtract $400 from the price of gold.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. 

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed.

Given that Bob is 75 miles ahead, the distance Tom needs to cover to catch up is 75 miles.

time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as $60 / $10 = 6 classes.

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck: 
$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,000.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,000."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary:

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Simplifying the equation:
x + 22000 = 70x

Subtract x from both sides:
22000 = 69x

Divide both sides by 69:
x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to round to the nearest whole number, which is 319.

Now, to find the total number of likes, we add the initial number of likes to the 20000 new likes:
319 + 20000 = 21919

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 (Tuesday) - $540 (Wednesday) = -$142

The difference is -$142, meaning Clara paid $142 less on Tuesday than Sheila paid on Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of the green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the sales of both months:

Total amount made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount made in two months = 2100

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert 24 eggs into dozens. To do this, we divide 24 by 12, which equals 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, then add them together.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the total rent and fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times of all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and the bottle of soda ($1.00), we get: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by the percentage of math teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money they have: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

If they decide to share the money equally, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy they will have in total, we need to add the amount of candy each of them had. 

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Now, to find out how much each of them will have if they share it equally, we divide the total amount by 3.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each of them will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 12 (first 8) + 3 (next 3) = 15
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 8

Total days = 15 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) = 31

Since there are 31 days in the month, and Christina has 15 good days, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

The bamboo will reach 600 inches in 20 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, there were 3 dogs gone, so the number of dogs became 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 9 toys. However, he already had 4 toys, so he needs 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 8 (initially bought) + 5 (additional needed) = 13 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

This amount is Skyler's investment.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

The sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns per potato. 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = x hash browns / 1 potato

Simplifying the proportion, we get:
6 = x

Now, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns:
6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then add up the number of cookies each person has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the Cookie Monster's total: 61 + 23 = 84 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 84 (Summer) = 286 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 286."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be positive integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, we multiply the number of years by 12 months.

10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months

Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, we multiply the number of months by the number of coins saved per month.

120 months * 20 coins/month = 2400 coins

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings and add it to Rong's monthly savings.

2/5 * 20 coins = 8 coins

Now, add 8 coins to Rong's monthly savings.

20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins

Since Neil saves 28 coins per month, we multiply the number of months by the number of coins saved per month.

120 months * 28 coins/month = 3360 coins

Now, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved.

2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 5760."
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check together is 100% of the total bill, which is 'x'. 
So, the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + 0.6x.

We know that the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To find 'x', we need to isolate it. 
x - 0.6x = $40
0.4x = $40
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find out how much John leaves with. 
John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."

"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.

Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to find the total number of chairs needed.

Total chairs = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there are 57 attendees (42 adults + 15 babies), and Mia already has 48 chairs, we need to find out how many more chairs she needs to get.

Number of additional chairs needed = 57 (total attendees) - 48 (total chairs) = 9

Next, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. 

Since there is space for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils in the box is 20 - 4 = 16.

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Total number of pencils / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). Each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (28 drinks * $2) + (42 snacks * $2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying his parts by the total amount of money: 3 * $100 = $300.

However, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract this amount from his share: $300 - $10 = $290.

Therefore, Gerald had $290 left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

$4200 / $2100 = 2

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% of 40% is greater than 40%. 

Let's recalculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of the city's water is used for industrial purposes, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, and 20% of that water is used for non-industrial purposes, we can multiply 40% by 20% to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 20 = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store would be 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound = $75.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each weighing 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, which weighs 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, which weighs 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the time spent in that scenario.

When both hands are at her sides, Helga taps her feet at a rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. She spends 5 - 2 = 3 minutes in this scenario.

When her arms are raised, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. So, the combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. She spends 2 minutes in this scenario.

Now, we can calculate the total number of taps for each scenario:

- For the first scenario: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
- For the second scenario: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the buckets of asphalt plus the fine he would have to pay to the city council. 

Cost of asphalt = 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
Fine to the city council = $120

Total cost of fixing the pothole = $75 + $120 = $195

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza had 12 slices and there were 5 pizzas in total, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these three people, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12, which is 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these two friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12, which is 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices. The total number of slices eaten is 16 + 18 = 34 slices. Subtracting this from the total number of slices, we get 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

There are 26 slices of pizza left."
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake.
2. Mara added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices became 2 + 3 = 5.
3. She tripled the number of slices, so the new total is 5 * 3 = 15.
4. Mara ate 2 slices, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

First, let's add up the total number of animals: 
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Now, divide the total number of animals by 7 days: 
28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

Mark also received 2 cards worth $4000 and $1000, so the total value of these cards is $5000. 

There are 30 cards worth $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark received is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children. 

The cost for 2 adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52.
The cost for 2 children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24.
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 adults and 2 children.

The cost for 2 adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28.
The cost for 2 children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20.
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

The family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old and new vendors.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.5 = $250 per day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes * $.4 = $200 per day

The difference in cost per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 per day * 7 days per week = $350 per week.

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's marbles. 
Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.
Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together.
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, not the number of groups needed. 

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 12. 

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all students. However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students per group.

The question seems to be asking for the number of groups needed to form, but it already states that 12 groups are required. Therefore, the answer is 0, as 12 groups are already sufficient to accommodate 54 students."
"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to know the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the monthly total by 2: 2000 * 2 = 4000.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of bananas over time.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so Gunther was left with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity per year and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. There are 12 months in a year, so the total cost of electricity per year is:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the total cost by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay per year:
$1200 / 4 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he had, subtract the number of broken ones, and then add the number of returned ones.

Initial glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Broken glasses: 10
Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Total remaining: 86 + 42 = 128

Jeff now has 128 glasses and plates."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from the trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from the trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

The final answer is 107."
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount you'll pay after the discount, you need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find the remaining people. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. 
People who think horse #12 will win = Remaining people - People who think horse #2 will win - People who think horse #7 will win.
People who think horse #12 will win = 40 - 10 - 24 = 6 people.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. So, if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of girls. 

3 * 6 = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we now know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up an equation to find the total number of puppies. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is 85."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows: 
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = Total cases / 2 = 250 / 2 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * Cases needed by the first house = 2 * 125 = 250

The third house needs 250 cases of shingles."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.

The total amount spent is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 200 + 90 = 290

Therefore, George has 290 fruits in total."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read.

300 + 150 = 450

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, but this doesn't change the total number of books they read altogether.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. 

Additionally, she earns $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30.

Since she doesn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $65 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $95.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has, which is 25. 

$75 / 25 = $3

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the series and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we can calculate the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

The cost of the remaining movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = Number of remaining movies * Cost of a normal movie
= 400 * $10
= $4000

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= $2000 + $800 + $4000
= $6800

The final answer is: $6800"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at an average of 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance they covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 

The distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles. 

The total distance to their vacation spot is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so let's assume Emma jumps on x enemies. Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10x + 15 and Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 12.

Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower, her time is x + 4 and Ava's time is x.

The time is not directly related to the score, but we can use it to find the difference in scores. We know that the time is inversely proportional to the score. 

Let's assume the time taken by Emma is 60 seconds (this is an arbitrary assumption, but it will not affect the final answer). Then, we can set up the equation:

10x + 15 = 30(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 = 30x + 120

Subtracting 10x from both sides:

15 = 20x + 120

Subtracting 120 from both sides:

-105 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

-5.25 = x

Since x cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution. However, we can try another approach.

Let's assume the time taken by Emma is x + 4 and the time taken by Ava is x. We can set up the equation:

10x + 15 = 30(x - (x + 4))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 = 30(-4)

10x + 15 = -120

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

10x = -135

Dividing both sides by 10:

x = -13.5

Since x cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution.

However, we can try another approach. Let's assume the time taken by Emma is x + 4 and the time taken by Ava is x. We can set up the equation:

10x + 15 = 30(x - (x + 4))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x + 15 = 30(-4)

10x + 15 = -120

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

10x = -135

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.
On the extra days, they ride twice the usual amount, so that's 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times.
The total number of times they ride on the extra days is 6 times.
The total number of times they ride in a week is 9 times + 6 times = 15 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish after buying more is 3 + x.

The total number of fish after buying more is 7 (initial fish) + x (new white fish) + 17 (new fish from the pet store). Since the total number of fish is the sum of the initial fish and the new fish, we can write the equation:

7 + x + 17 = 3 + x + 2x

Combine like terms:

24 + x = 3 + 3x

Subtract x from both sides:

24 = 3 + 2x

Subtract 3 from both sides:

21 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

10.5 = x

Since we can't have half a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider that Bob bought a whole number of fish.

"To calculate the total weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the total weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amount she spent on twenties and quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount Carrie paid for lunch is $155."
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and subtract the amount he has from it. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups: 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back seashells: 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.

Since each of these 6 groups had 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by 2 to find the total number of seashells: 6 * 2 = 12.

The final answer is 12."

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Then, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 bottle caps * $0.25 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. So, her special pay for 3 hours is 3 * $30 = $90.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount paid to all employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Since this is the amount paid in one month, we need to multiply it by 3 to get the total amount paid in three months:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time taken for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. 
10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200). 

200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used: 
John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows: 
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used) - 3 (dropped) = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 
14 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 7 S'mores.

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost for each person:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter = $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters = $0.625.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for all four friends: $0.25 + 3 * $0.625 = $0.25 + $1.875 = $2.125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

Additionally, she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2F = 2Z.

Now, we know that S = 2Z and O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get 2Z + O + Z + Z + G = 10.

Since O = 4Z, we can substitute it into the equation, resulting in 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + G = 10.

Combine like terms: 8Z + G = 10.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amount of salt, oil, and citrus zest is 2Z + 4Z + Z = 7Z. This means that the amount of sugar is 10 - 7Z = G.

Substituting G = 10 - 7Z into the equation 8Z + G = 10, we get 8Z + 10 - 7Z = 10.

Combine like terms: Z = 0.

Since Z = 0, we can find the amount of oil by substituting Z into the equation O = 4Z, resulting in O = 4(0) = 0.

The final answer is: 0"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Converting this to minutes, we multiply by 60.

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time.

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot at that time.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Then, 1/2 of the cars left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns per cycle is 5 * $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 * $6 = $180.

To find out his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours per week writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. In a month, she spends 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

She spends 15 minutes per day, six days a week, doing her makeup. In a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add the time she spends on recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup: 72 + 480 + 360 = 912 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 912 / 60 = 15.2 hours.

The final answer is: 15.2"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is $129.00. 

For the additional items, Angela needs 2 extra mirrors ($15.00 each), 0 extra shelves (since she only needs 2 and the standard package includes 2), and 18 extra pictures ($15.00 each).

The cost of the additional items is (2 x $15.00) + (18 x $15.00) = $30.00 + $270.00 = $300.00.

The total cost is the cost of the standard items plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $300.00 = $429.00.

The final answer is: $429."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. 

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance as 3 kangaroos. Since the speed of the turtles is half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.

Time taken by 4 turtles = Time taken by 3 kangaroos * 2
Time taken by 4 turtles = 18 hours * 2
Time taken by 4 turtles = 36 hours

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has now should be equal to $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants: 
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 3 x 3 = 9 slices from the large apples.

He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 slices from the small apples.

In total, Adam had 9 + 15 = 24 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so he has 24 - 15 = 9 slices left.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find the milk production per cow: 5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow: 25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows.

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs: 15 - 3 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total amount spent on squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total amount spent on water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 240 socks. To find the total number of dishes and socks they have together, we add the number of dishes and socks.

60 + 240 = 300

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 300."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Principal + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: $750 + $225 = $975

So, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be $75 (green food) + $48 (red food) = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90 rooms.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the cleaning time:

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need 7 packs of glue sticks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 infected people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 infected people.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 
Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 * 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that Gretchen had 70 gold coins, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = x + (x + 30)
= 40 + 70
= 110

The final answer is: 110"

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we find 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

Total money from selling chickens = 180 * $50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the cost of the chicken he bought, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total money he will make:

Cost of the chicken = Total money from selling chickens - Desired profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chicken for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

32 glasses / 3 = 10.67 glasses per person

Since we can't sell a fraction of a glass, we'll round down to 10 glasses per person. 

Now, we can find out how many glasses Julie sold more than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 10 glasses. 

14 - 10 = 4

The answer is 4."

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost of the new rope is 1.5 * 20 = $30.

Sarah's original rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, so the total amount she has is 2 * 20 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she has: 40 - 30 = $10.

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 * 2 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

The cost of strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of apples is half the price of strawberries, so each apple costs $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since the result is negative, Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys = 200
Number of toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Number of toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that were successfully arranged. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones were successfully arranged. 

The total number of microphones is 50. 

80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of successfully arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

40 / 2 = 20 

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

6 birds in the bushes * 2/3 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups.

6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the speed of the thingamabob first. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can express this relationship as:

Whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11 * Thingamabob's speed = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Thingamabob's speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob's speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig's speed = 5 * Thingamabob's speed
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. This includes the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We already know the cost of the salad and yogurt, which is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total daily cost to find the cost of the two carrots. $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we need to divide the cost of the carrots by 2 to find the cost of one carrot. $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Therefore, Tasha made $54 from mowing lawns.

The amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54 = $26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total hours per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks. 
Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, Martha had 3x notebooks. 
We know Martha had 7 notebooks, so 3x = 7. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7/3. 
However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 
So Joseph had 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks. 
Joseph still has 2 notebooks. 
To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's: 12 - 2 = 10.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, while Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4 * 2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards. So, 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material are needed for small masks.

For large masks: 8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards. To convert this into yards, we multiply 8/3 by 2.25, which equals 6 yards. So, 6 yards of material are needed for large masks.

Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, we need to find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total number of marbles Dean initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical eight-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 
Then, we calculate the time for the extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed.

3000 / 1000 = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total available time (8 hours) by the time taken for a round trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen on this Friday, but we know he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. Let's assume he's seen 5 movies on this Friday. If he's seen 5 movies on this Friday, he's already spent $10 * 5 = $50. If he's seen 0 movies on this Friday, he's spent $0.

Since we don't know how many movies he's seen on this Friday, let's consider both scenarios.

Scenario 1: He's seen 5 movies on this Friday.
He has $134 left. He can buy 134 / 10 = 13.4 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

Scenario 2: He's seen 0 movies on this Friday.
He has $134 left. He can buy 134 / 10 = 13.4 tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys before buying bouncy balls: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys before buying bouncy balls: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had was 4 * 2 = 8. Maria also had 2 balloons. 

So, the total number of balloons initially was 8 (friends) + 2 (Maria) = 10.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given was 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 10 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 25.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

25"
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the 24-hour stay.

For the 12-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since he wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost for these additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

For the 24-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = number of goats * goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = number of sheep * sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also spent 10 dollars on 5 pencils, so he has 250 - 10 = 240 dollars left.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with 240 dollars. 

240 / 25 = 9.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pen, John can buy 9 pens with the money he has left.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 

Craig's words: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, Craig's brother's words: 300 + 50 = 350 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the letters in Craig's words and his brother's words. 

300 + 350 = 650

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

The fixed charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor charge is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
The parts charge is $60.

The total cost is $40 (fixed charge) + $78.75 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to cover the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to cover the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets of 30 reports

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which is a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to convert both times to minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes before 12 a.m.
5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes after 12 a.m.

Now, we subtract the wake-up time from the sleep time: 600 - 355 = 245 minutes.

However, she also woke up from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those 23 minutes to the total sleep time.

245 + 23 = 268 minutes.

The final answer is: 268"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first convert two dozen to the number of cups: 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: (2/3) * 24 = 16 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons: 16 * (2/3) = 10.67, but since we can't have a fraction of a measuring spoon, we round down to 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 10 measuring spoons and received 6 as a gift. So, he now has 10 + 6 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and received no measuring cups as a gift. So, he now has 24 measuring cups.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 16 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 40 utensils.

"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, there are 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.

The remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these are to her boyfriend, which is 1/3 * 3 = 1 email.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jason) + 2 (Jordan) = 8 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 8 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116.

The number of holes dug on the fourth day can be found by subtracting the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87.

The final answer is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 225."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net distance traveled south is 300 - 36 = 264 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, John paid $2100 for all the phones.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has $14 saved, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more money he needs. 

Remaining cost = Total cost - Saved money 
Remaining cost = $39 - $14 
Remaining cost = $25

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount. 

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work. 

Number of hours = Remaining cost / Hourly wage 
Number of hours = $25 / $5 
Number of hours = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of cherries, we can say that Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60, 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165. Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225.
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90, 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225. Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315.

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen. However, each bottle is 8 ounces, so we need to divide 32 by 8 to find out how many bottles she'll need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The number of students leaving early is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert this to inches as well. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space required for each plant and the space between them. Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there is 18 inches of space between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant and the space between them is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

To find out how many 30-inch spaces can fit in the 1332-inch flower bed, we divide 1332 by 30. 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost of the flowers Pat needs to buy is 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = 0.5

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Since peeling and cooking time is the same, we can add the peeling time to the cooking time:

15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract it from the initial temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, and it was off for 2 hours, the room warms up by:
2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the total cooling effect from the initial temperature and the warming effect:
Initial temperature - (total cooling effect - warming effect) = Initial temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees
= Initial temperature - 14 degrees

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a variable 'x'. The problem asks for the difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature, which is 'x - (x - 14)'. 

Simplifying the expression, we get:
x - x + 14
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since his dad was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet for the first time, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 90 - 30 = 60 years.

Now, we know that 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and 60 years have passed since Bill saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Bill was born is 75 - 60 = 15 years.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, and 15 years have passed since Bill was born, we can calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 30 - 15 = 15 years.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany combined.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30. 

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can express this as:

H = 2 * (A + A + W + H) / 4

Since we know the total age is 20, we can express this as:

A + A + H + W = 20

Substituting the known values of A and A, we get:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

7 + H + W = 20

H + W = 13

Now, we can substitute H = 2 * (A + A + W + H) / 4 into the equation H + W = 13:

2 * (3 + 4 + W + 2 * (3 + 4 + W + H) / 4) / 4 = 13

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + H) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + H) / 4) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + 2 * (13 - W) / 4) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + 2 * 13 / 4 - W / 2) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (7 + W + 13 / 2 - W / 2) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 2 * (14 + W / 2) / 4) / 4 = 13

2 * (7 + W + 7 + W / 2) / 4 = 13

2 * (14 + 3W / 2) / 4 = 13

(28 + 3W) / 4 = 13

The age of Wilfred is 8."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

First, we find the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies.

Then, we divide the total number of cookies by 2 to find out how many cookies were given to the church: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were in the church: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, there are 4 slices in total. Since each adult gets 2 slices, each adult gets 2/4 = 1/2 of the total slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(1/2) / 4 = 1/8
1/8 * 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, each adult gets 12.5% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars sold / Total boxes sold

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and it is rented 3 days a week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, so the total cost of renting the studio in a month is 12 * $25 = $300.

The dance studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. The total revenue from the students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15. The total revenue from the students in a month is 12 * $15 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total revenue from the students minus the total cost of renting the studio, which is $180 - $300 = -$120. However, since the cost of renting the studio exceeds the revenue from the students, the dance studio would incur a loss of $120 per month.

The final answer is -120."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

Cost = Total gallons x cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = 826 dollars

The cost to fill the pool will be $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means the other half of the students are 1500 / 2 = 750 students under 16 years old.

We are also told that one-half of the students under 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 750 / 2 = 375.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The total number of male students is the sum of male students over 16 years old and male students under 16 years old, which is 375 + 375 = 750.

Now, subtracting the total number of male students from the total number of students, we get 3000 - 750 = 2250.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 2250."
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 91% of the initial charge (100% - 9% = 91%). 

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 93% of the charge remaining after 5 hours (100% - 7% = 93%). 

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x = 0.845x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. 

0.845x = 0.28

To find the initial charge, we can divide both sides by 0.845:

x = 0.28 / 0.845
x = 0.333

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33.33%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wages are $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings from tips are $15 * 40 = $600. 

Her total weekly earnings are $400 (wages) + $600 (tips) = $1000. 

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 20% of $10000 is $2000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly earnings of $1000. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks. 

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of her friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

The number of guests remaining is now 61 + 30 = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, she will get 0.75 * 24 = 18 points from the easy questions.

The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since they are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by adding the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, let's multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches would be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2
Total number of blue balloons = 6 (already had) + 2 (added) = 8

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 8
Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 36

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10

Now, let's add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 0.70

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.70 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000 * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000 * 4 years = $300,000

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned after graduating:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000 per year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12:
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 - 325
Remaining distance = 1630 kilometers

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

160"
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. 

The area of a single tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt. 

Total tiles required = Total area / Area of a single tile = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost per tile.

Total cost = Total tiles * Cost per tile = 200 tiles * $12 = $2400.

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed, so he needs to wash 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week. 

The total number of sets per week is 8 + 1 = 9.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do 9 / 3 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 (two years ago) + 150 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is 31."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The visit costs $300/hour, and it lasted 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and it lasted 2 hours. So, the cost of the parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. 

The number of additional guests is 28 - 20 = 8. The cost for these additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48.

The total cost is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $48 (for the additional guests) = $173.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

315 - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the remaining bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day.

291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

So, the third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas per day."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (15/12) = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75. 

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the arrival of the first train and the departure of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes after the initial time.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to leave (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to leave (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 times the original price. 

Let's denote the original price as x. Then, the sale price is 0.75x. 

Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, the sale price is 0.75x. 

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. This means the friend bought the watch at 1.2 times the sale price. 

The friend bought the watch at 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x. 

The original price of the watch is x. The friend bought the watch at 0.9x. 

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price the friend bought it for, and divide it by the original price, then multiply by 100. 

The difference between the original price and the price the friend bought it for is x - 0.9x = 0.1x. 

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish per second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish per hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home:

Total Time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total Time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches, which is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence that Sam gets as 'x'. Then, the amount of fence that Harry gets is 'x + 60'. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of MTB price): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 7 days in a week. So, the total minutes in a week is 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. Total minutes spent in classes per week is 200 minutes. Total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. So, the total minutes spent on learning per week is 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of it, the amount they ate is x/2. So, the amount left after the velociraptors ate is x - x/2 = x/2.

We know that the amount left after the velociraptors ate is 270 kilograms, so x/2 = 270. Solving for x, we get x = 540 kilograms.

This means that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. Let's call the initial amount 'y'. Since the T-Rex ate half of it, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is y/2 = 540. Solving for y, we get y = 1080 kilograms.

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. Since the friend can choose any of the remaining sodas, the total number of options is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of returned item: $15.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $58.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. To find the new balance, we subtract the cost of the returned item:
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The new balance on her credit card is $70.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that when the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given relationships. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age: 4 * 2 = 8.
Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3 to find Caroline's age: 8 * 3 = 24.

Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years. 

The total amount she needs to save is her annual savings multiplied by the number of years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. 

Assuming she has been working for 0 years, she needs to work for 60 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by 4, then divide the result by 5.

First, we divide 100 centimeters by 4: 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we divide 25 cm by 5: 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to first find the total number of boys and then use the percentage to calculate the number of girls.

Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, then subtract the coupon value.

Cost of pots: $19

"To find the average height of heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

Total height of heels = (3 x 4 inches) + (3 x 2 inches) 
Total height of heels = 12 inches + 6 inches 
Total height of heels = 18 inches 

Total number of heels = 3 + 3 = 6 

Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Total number of heels 
Average height of heels = 18 inches / 6 
Average height of heels = 3 inches 

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55

"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, I assume there is a mistake and it should be Pierre, Paul, and Jacques. 

So, Pierre and Paul together have 3 + 4 = 7 kg. 

The remaining amount of apples for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. So, the total amount she spent on the books is $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total distance for one trip: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance for one trip by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles per day, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift.

Let's calculate the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

However, since the fifth worker needs to produce 2 toys in 10 hours, we can calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour by dividing 2 toys by 10 hours. 

2 toys / 10 hours = 0.2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 0.2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of both dogs, we add Elijah's dogs' weight to Kory's dog's weight: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 / 400 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5 to find the 2nd fastest car's speed.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation: 2x = Liam's age two years ago.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 14. To find 'x', we divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since 'x' represents Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find Vince's current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000 per month.

40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of water Donny has in the second mug. Since he can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

Initially, he had 2 mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, so the other mug must be 2 - 1 = 1 mug. Since 1 mug is 33 degrees, the second mug is also 33 degrees.

However, the problem states that the second mug is unknown, so we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

The minimum temperature of the second mug is 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals: 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The total cost of the 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. To do this, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels. 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 3 scoops is. 3 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 3 = 0 scoops. 

Now, we know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops. To find out how many potatoes 0 scoops is, we need to divide 3 less than 6 potatoes by 0 scoops. However, we can't divide by zero, so we need to find out how many potatoes 1 scoop is. 

We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops, so we can set up an equation: 3x = 0 scoops. 

Now, we can solve for x. 3x = 0 scoops, so x = 0 potatoes per scoop. 

Now that we know 1 scoop is 0 potatoes, we can find out how many scoops Gomer ate. We know Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 5 less than 23 scoops is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. 

Now that we know Gomer ate 18 scoops, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. Since 1 scoop is 0 potatoes, Gomer ate 18 * 0 = 0 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons in a year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first calculate the total number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7.

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is 7 * 3 = 21.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold is 21 * 12 = 252.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. The revenue from selling 60% of his inventory is $84. To find the loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16."
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

The maximum time among these is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for each fish.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, the total cost for one fish for the entire month would be 31 days * $1/day = $31.

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total cost for all her fish in May would be 3 * $31 = $93.

The final answer is 93."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person gets T/3 seashells.

To find the number of seashells each person gets, we need to know the total number of seashells. However, we can express the number of seashells each person gets in terms of 'x':

Number of seashells each person gets = (5x + 5)/3

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we can't provide a numerical answer."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per day

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of additional bottles needed as follows:

460 bottles (required) - 4200 (available) = -2740 bottles

However, this is not possible since Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This means that Hortex cannot satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people with its current production capacity.

The final answer is: -2740"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of purple babies wearing a bow.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 1/3 of the total number of babies, which is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100:

(2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 75.47%

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 75.47%."

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold another 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

Abraham sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * 3 = $60.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get: 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting the second equation into the previous equation, we get: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Initially, Ronnie had $5. After giving $3 to her sister, Ronnie is left with:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Since there are four colors of paint and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, let's denote the amount of each color as x. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided among the remaining three colors. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x. The total amount of paint used for the other half is 2x (x for red, x for white, and x for purple). 

The total amount of paint used for the entire mural is the sum of the paint used for the yellow half and the other half: 2x + 2x = 4x. We know this equals 12 pints. 

4x = 12

To find x, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds counted by Alice, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds counted each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds counted by Alice at the end of the week is 93."
"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120 pods

Now, we know that you can run 1 cycle per pod. So, the number of cycles you can run with the new box is:

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box = 120

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by the cost of the new box:

Number of cycles for $1 = 120 / 12 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the total number of bills is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can only write with 20% of the chalk, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday.

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

0.20 * x = 2.75

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.75 / 0.20
x = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 13

The teacher will have 13 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = (1/3) * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = (1/4) * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we need to multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3 and then add 2.

3 * 5 = 15
15 + 2 = 17

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund for 1600 gallons would be:

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of one set of 100 books ($500) to find the total number of sets he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets

Since he has 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school * 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. He put 1 in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Then, he picked up these 7 apples, put all but 1 in his pocket and threw the remaining 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 7 (previous) + 6 (new) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so the total miles for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, so the total miles for these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from John's current age. 

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can represent Jim's age as x. Then, John's age would be 2x. 

We know John's current age is 28, so we can set up the equation 2x = 28. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

"To find out how many slices of apple they all ate, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by each person.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate 6 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of her hair decreased by 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost of the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

40 gallons (whale's blood) * 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

120 gallons (shark's blood) * 10 = 1200 gallons

The total amount of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400."
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house first, then subtract the height of the second floor.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diapers changed per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan is also changing diapers, we need to subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total to find out how many Jordan changes. 

10 (total diapers changed) - 5 (diapers changed by his wife) = 5 diapers changed by Jordan per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then find the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans is 900 - 864 = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who entered at the first stop.

Initial number of people = 20
Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

Now, we need to find the number of people who entered at the second station. Since 3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first stop entered the bus at the second station, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
3/4 of 40 = (3/4) * 40 = 30

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.

Total number of people after the second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

Now, the number of people on the bus doubled at the third station. To find the number of people on the bus after the third stop, we can multiply the total number of people after the second stop by 2.

Total number of people after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, we can find the remaining spaces by subtracting the total number of people after the third stop from the capacity of the bus.

Remaining spaces = 200 - 180 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * 5 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years. The total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * 3 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since there are 3 grades (4-7), the total number of students is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 30 / 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't use the full 45 minutes, we'll assume they'll use the remaining time in the next group. 

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 4 and then multiply the result by 3, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds needed by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies can be represented as '3c - 2'.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of the nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. Since Karen is getting both, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services.

First, calculate the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

The total amount Karen would pay is $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, we need to find 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. The remaining number of apples is 60 - 24 = 36.

Walter then gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find 25% of 36, we need to calculate 25/100 * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9.

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. The remaining number of apples is 36 - 9 = 27.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we need to multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, we can calculate the total hours traveled as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the total number of books can be represented as:

B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

(3B/2) - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

3B/2 = 115

Multiply both sides by 2:

3B = 230

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 76.67

Since the number of books must be a whole number, we can round down to 76 books for the bottom shelf.

Now, we can calculate the number of books for each shelf:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelf: 76/2 = 38 books
Top shelf: 76 - 5 = 71 books

Now, we can calculate the total number of books per bookcase:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelf: 38 books
Top shelf: 71 books

Since each bookcase has 2 middle shelves, we can calculate the total number of books per bookcase:

Bottom shelf: 76 books
Middle shelves: 2 * 38 = 76 books
Top shelf: 71 books

Total books per bookcase: 76 + 76 + 71 = 223 books

Since 223 is more than 110, we need 2 bookcases to hold all the books.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Since Rose sells 3 eggs for $1, and she has 5 dozens of eggs (60 eggs), the total revenue is:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per sale = 20 sales
20 sales * $1 per sale = $20

Now, let's find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the first test:

Questions correct on the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct on the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Since she needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test:

Questions correct on the second test = Total questions - Questions correct on the first test
Questions correct on the second test = 77 - 42

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this as an equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5s - 4

First, let's calculate the number of small candles: 
4 rooms * 4 small candles per room = 16 small candles

Next, let's calculate the number of medium candles: 
4 rooms * 5 medium candles per room = 20 medium candles

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles: 
16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people. 
4 people * 2 flashlights per person = 8 flashlights

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works for 5 days in a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants require a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8.

Since each of these 8 plants requires a quarter of a cup of water, we multiply 8 by 0.25: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

For the water part: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy. 

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 7 * $2.00 = $14.00.

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, we can multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by 30.

10 dozen doughnuts per day is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

In June, Derrick sells 120 doughnuts per day for 30 days. So, the total number of doughnuts he sells in June is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To calculate the total cost of dry-cleaning for Alicia's clothes, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

In 5 weeks, Alicia will spend $47.00 * 5 = $235.00 on dry-cleaning."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages:

Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4500 words / 0.16 words per second
Time = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60
Time (minutes) = 4.69 minutes

The final answer is: 4.69"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows: 1 cup / 0.5 cup = 2 lemons per gallon.

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be 5 * 2 = 10 lemons.

For the extra gallon that needs to be twice as tart, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups as follows: 2 cups / 0.5 cup = 4 lemons.

Now, we add the lemons needed for the main 5 gallons and the extra gallon: 10 lemons + 4 lemons = 14 lemons.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, let's multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we can add the number of blue and yellow blocks to find the total number of non-red blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12 blocks.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can subtract the number of non-red blocks from the total to find the number of red blocks: 32 (total) - 12 (non-red) = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

There are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4 of them. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so before dropping the marbles, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets is 2 adult tickets + 1 child ticket = 2 * $12 + $8 = $24 + $8 = $32.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

The total cost is $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find the age of Emma. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."

Now, let's subtract the number of cracked seashells:
732 (total seashells) - 67 (cracked seashells) = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 6 = $72.00.

For the bowls, she needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 5 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * 4 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to complete it, which is given as 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours. 

Then, we add 2 hours to this result to find Anna's time. 

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed Dexter has left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the pigs will consume 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs John will serve and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money Frances has left:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making the total 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making the total 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 = 40 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

40 - 5 = 35

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total, leaving him with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 6 + 7 + 2 = 15."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered must be 29 - 24 = 5.

However, we know that Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes, so the number of beakers he gathered must be 16 + 2 = 18. 

This means that Igor lost 18 - 5 = 13 beakers.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we can assume that Aaron runs half the distance, which is 2 miles. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, her speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Vanessa to run 4 miles. Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is 64."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to first calculate the daily revenue. 

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10, and the cost of wine is $5. So, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total number of reservations per week is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total weekly revenue is the total number of reservations multiplied by the cost per reservation, which is 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor. 

Total cost = $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for 'c': c = 20 - b.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 2(20 - b) + 4b = 70.

Expanding and simplifying, we get 40 - 2b + 4b = 70, which simplifies to 2b = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into c = 20 - b, which gives us c = 20 - 15 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
