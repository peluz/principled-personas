"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll round down to 3 muffins).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

The total number of bolts required is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

First, we need to find the increased value: 
$80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Now, we add the original value to the increased value to get the new value: 
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the original value: 
$200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000

The profit Josh made is $120,000."
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 sessions * 3 sprints/session = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance run per week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed per chicken is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 20 * 2 = 40 cups.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to first determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, 20 minutes are spent on the restart. So, the actual time spent downloading the first 60% is:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the entire file is the sum of the time spent downloading the first 60% and the time spent downloading the remaining 40%:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we need to add up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home. Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

So, John is 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the tree needs to break even (i.e., the net profit should be zero), we need to find the number of years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90.

Number of years to break even: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - (x/3 + 2) - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 1 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 3 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry is higher ($250) than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can simply add the distances covered by both trains, which is 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we can add the distances covered by both trains, which is 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we need to add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance covered by each train. 

Total distance covered by each train = 160 miles (westward) + 300 miles (northward) = 460 miles.

The final answer is: 460"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching is 50 weeks * $20/hour = $1000.

Her annual salary from coaching is 50 weeks * 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $2250.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $1000 + $2250 = $3250.

The final answer is: $3250."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 * 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Required speed = Total distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before and after spilling.

Initially, the orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in both drinks before spilling: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the orange drink becomes 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the pineapple drink and the remaining water in the orange drink: 9 + 17/3 = 9 + 5.67 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is 14.67."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 6 years
31 - Raymond's age = 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond was 25 years old when his son was born. To find the number of years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

31 (Samantha's current age) - 25 (Raymond's age at son's birth) = 6 years

Raymond's son was born 6 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The remaining distance after his first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance he traveled after his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled after the second stop from the remaining distance after the first stop: 40 - 45 = -5 miles. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance between his first and second stops is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages. Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, 25% more than that is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * 15 = $195.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 * 20 = $160.

He has $5 left after buying the video games. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money he earned: 195 - 160 = $35.

Since he has $35 left, we can set up an equation to find out how many Lego sets he still has: 35 = 15x, where x is the number of Lego sets he still has.

Dividing both sides by 15, we get x = 35 / 15 = 2.33.

Since John can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John still has 2 Lego sets."
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day, which is 3 miles (since we don't know his speed, we'll use this as a variable for now).
- He runs half as much on the other two days, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
- The total distance for the other two days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 miles.
- Total distance per week = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

Now, let's calculate his speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 9 miles / (3 + 1.5 + 1.5)
Speed = 9 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 1.5 miles per hour

The final answer is: 1.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she travels for 6 hours, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. 

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as 'x'. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther with the gemstone, the distance with the gemstone would be 3x.

We know that the distance the javelin can reach with the gemstone (3x) is still within the dragon's reach of 1000 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1000

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 1000 / 3 = 333.33 feet.

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone. This distance would be the difference between the distance with the gemstone (3x) and the dragon's reach (1000 feet).

Distance = 3x - 1000 = 3(333.33) - 1000 = 1000 - 1000 = 0 feet.

However, this would mean Polly can stand right next to the dragon, which is not the case. We need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone and subtract the dragon's reach from it.

Distance with gemstone = 3x = 3(333.33) = 1000 feet.

However, this is still within the dragon's reach. We need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone and still be outside the dragon's reach.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. The correct approach is to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone and subtract the dragon's reach from it.

Distance with gemstone = 3x = 3(400) = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's reach from this distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find the number of servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 * 300 = 240g.

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips.

"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to first determine the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost = Cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks + (Number of candles * Cost per candle)
Total cost = $10.00 + (20 * $2.00)
Total cost = $10.00 + $40.00
Total cost = $50.00

Total revenue = Number of candles * Selling price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $50.00
Net profit = -$10.00

The net profit is -$10.00, meaning Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used and the ones she had left.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used and the ones she had left: 220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243.

Now, we subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total to find the number of Post-it notes in the package: 243 (total) - 80 (initial) = 163.

The package she purchased contained 163 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Total number of floors = 15
Number of occupied floors = 3/4 * 15 = 11.25 (round down to 11, since we can't have a fraction of a floor)

Each floor has 8 units, so the total number of occupied units is:
11 * 8 = 88

Now, we can find the total number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Total number of units = 15 * 8 = 120
Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 88 = 32

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we can divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies:

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

The total number of oranges that are not good is the sum of unripe and sour oranges, which is 5 + 2 = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000. This is the annual pension for the remaining 10 years.

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
140 * 6 = 840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.
10% of 140 is 0.1 * 140 = 14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = 126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
126 * 6 = 756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount she paid for the entire year:
840 + 756 = 1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596."
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract that from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gas in the tank to find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank:

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all units is 5 units * $3 per unit = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can write the equation as (1/2) * 400 = 200 pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is 'x + 8', we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year is 4. 

The total number of blocks is the number of years multiplied by the number of blocks per year, which is 11 * 4 = 44.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them together.

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% annual increase for each year.

Initial salary: $600
Year 1 increase: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Year 1 salary: $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2 increase: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Year 2 salary: $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3 increase: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Year 3 salary: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4 increase: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Year 4 salary: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5 increase: 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Year 5 salary: $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Since Sylvie has already clocked 5 years in the company, we can stop here. Her annual salary after three more years of service is $966.31."
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 10 * 20 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed would be G - 2. 

We know that Lee's speed is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation: G - 2 = 38. Solving for G, we get G = 40.

Now, we know Gerald's original speed was 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement, his new speed would be 40 + (40 * 0.1) = 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes. 

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the equation is: 32 = x / 2.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and the first 15 minutes had an unknown number of cars. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes 'x'. 

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25.

Solving for x, we get x = 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 
So, the number of plants she will remain with is: 
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for all friends: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175.

175"
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages to be read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. Since he has 4 more days to complete the reading, we divide the remaining pages by 4:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Total Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes
Time = 14 minutes

The fog bank will take 14 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left to place, we first need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of them on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is 500."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3, since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats: 5 + 15 = 20.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours per day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. We need to convert the 30-minute episode to hours, which is 0.5 hours. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on other days: 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent watching TV on other days from the total time: 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours.

However, this doesn't make sense because we know Frankie watched some TV on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent watching TV on these days is 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 7.5 = 0 hours. However, this is still not correct.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 4 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent watching TV on these days is 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 7.5 = -0.5 hours. However, this is still not correct.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. So, the total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday must be 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up and then multiply it by the number of rolls.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, the total number of roll-ups eaten is 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:
90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed and the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

First, we need to find Julia's rowing speed. We know she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total distance Julia rowed, we need to know the total time it took her to reach the shore. 

The shore was 64 seconds away, and it took her 16 seconds to row the first 20 feet. So, the remaining distance is 64 - 20 = 44 feet.

Time taken to row the remaining 44 feet = Distance / Speed
Time taken to row the remaining 44 feet = 44 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time taken to row the remaining 44 feet = 35.2 seconds

Total time taken to reach the shore = 16 seconds + 35.2 seconds
Total time taken to reach the shore = 51.2 seconds

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rowed:
Total distance = 20 feet + 44 feet
Total distance = 64 feet

Now, we can find the total amount of water the boat took on:
Total water taken on = (Total distance / 10) * 2 liters
Total water taken on = (64 feet / 10) * 2 liters
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

The final answer is: 12.8"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can write another equation: 
B = 50D

Now we can equate the two expressions for B:
300 = 50D

To find the number of ducks, we can divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide this by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons per part.

Now, we can multiply the number of parts of sugar (7) by the value of one part (6 teaspoons) to find the total amount of sugar used: 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

The final answer is 42."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = (1/3) * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters stamped from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped
= 30 - 20
= 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has.

Lily has 50 friends.
Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

The total number of friends they have together is 50 + 70 = 120.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

The remaining elves are 60 - 20 = 40.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

The number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

Expenditure in May = $500

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of car washes for Tom in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the cost of each car wash.

Number of car washes per month: 4

Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

The number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the number of questions by the time taken: 75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed.

Since Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour, we can calculate the time taken to complete the first test as 600 questions / 5 questions per hour = 120 hours. However, we know Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, so this information is not needed for the calculation.

For the second test, we can calculate the number of questions completed as 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

To find the total number of questions completed, we add the questions completed in both tests: 600 + 30 = 630 questions.

Since the total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175, we can find the number of questions left incomplete by subtracting the total questions completed from the total questions: 175 - 630 is incorrect, as Mark did not complete 630 questions. The correct calculation is 175 - 75 = 100 questions completed in the first test, and 100 - 30 = 70 questions completed in the second test. So, the total questions completed is 100 + 70 = 170. Subtracting this from the total number of questions in both tests, we get 175 - 170 = 5 questions left incomplete.

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first determine the number of blue gumballs. We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. Let's represent the number of pink gumballs as 'p'. 

The equation can be written as: p = 4 * 12 + 22

p = 48 + 22

p = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the non-food items and then add the cost of the food items.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

Since there is a 10% tax on these items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars. 10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. 

So, the total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The total cost of everything is 11 + 5 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Now, we can calculate Kim's profit by subtracting his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

Now, all the bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive. So, 45 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

The amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $14."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, so Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home. 

Waiting time = 40 - 36 = 4 minutes

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 53 + 7 = 60 fries.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we add the total hours for both sets of days: 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of all the toys is the sum of the costs of the red cars, the doll, and the action figures: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9

"Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the total yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so divide the total seconds by 60 to convert to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they made $50 in revenue, the number of gallons they made is $50 / $10 = 5 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total cost per gallon by the number of gallons: $5 * 5 = $25.

We know that there are 80 Japanese participants and a total of 240 participants. 

The number of Chinese participants can be found by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants: 
240 - 80 = 160

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants: 
160 - 60 = 100

Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel:
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far:
1500 (rent) + 2000 (car fuel) = 3500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
6000 (total salary) - 3500 (total spent) = 2500
Half of 2500 is 2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on donations:
1250 (charity) + 200 (daughter) + 700 (wife) = 2150

Now, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Now, since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got

white carnations = 200 / 5
white carnations = 40

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can set up the equation:
red roses = 4 * white carnations
red roses = 4 * 40
red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to 19: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

Now that we know Mark's current age, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation: J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 legs, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, their times are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

"To find the total number of straw pieces used among the small rodents, we need to subtract the straw used by the rabbits from the total straw used. 

Total straw used by rabbits = 20 pieces
Total straw used by small rodents = 160 pieces
Total straw used by hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50 pieces

Total straw used by small rodents = Total straw used by rabbits + Total straw used by hamsters
160 = 20 + 50
160 = 70

Since the straw used by the small rodents is 70, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total straw used by the small rodents by the number of straw each rat is given.

Number of rats = Total straw used by small rodents / Straw per rat
= 70 / 6
= 11.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the number of rats per cage, not the total number of rats. 

Number of rats per cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages
= 11.67 / 3
= 3.89

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more likely that the question is asking for the number of rats per cage, and since the rats are in equal groups, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Now, we divide the total transportation cost by the cost per bag to find the number of bags transported:
Number of bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags transported = $140 / $2
Number of bags transported = 70

Since the trader bought and sold the same number of bags, we can set up an equation:
Number of bags bought = Number of bags sold
Number of bags bought = 70

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 * 5 = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail also contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 * 5 = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

- He worked 52 weeks in a year (365 days / 7 days per week).
- His weekly earnings are $2000.
- His total earnings for the year without the award would be 52 * $2000 = $104,000.
- He received the $5000 award, so his total earnings for the year will be $104,000 + $5000 = $104,500.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are $104,500.

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes first. 

Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres, the total number of tons of grapes is 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced is 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each type and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue pens: 
Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she has 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens: 
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she has 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of green, blue, and red pens together: 
22 (green pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 88 pens.

Janet now has 88 pens."
"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To get the total score of 558, we need to add the required score to 358 and subtract 71. 

558 - 358 = 200.

So, Brinley needs a score of 200 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the last three weeks to find the total number of kilometers he rode in total. 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 460."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates. 

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups
Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. 
Then, the total cost of 240 cups = 240x

We are given that the total cost of 240 cups is $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates. 
So, we can set up the equation:
240x = 36000 - 1200
240x = 34800

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides by 240:
x = 34800 / 240
x = 145

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

4x + y = 60, where x is the number of babysitting sessions and y is the number of lawn mowing sessions.

Since we know that 12 babysitting sessions will earn her $60, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

4(12) + y = 60
48 + y = 60
y = 12

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times to earn the remaining amount needed for the jacket and shoes."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express this as w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round down to 133 customers on the first day. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day:

Second day = 133 + 50 = 183

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day:

Third day = 500 - (133 + 183) = 500 - 316 = 184

The final answer is 184."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the combined rate of leakage is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 32 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 32. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 32 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 32 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 32. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 32

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express x as x = 4y + 32.

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 32) - 32 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 64 - 32 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 32 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 32 = 0

Subtract 32 from both sides:

4y = -32

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -8

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can express x in terms of y from the second equation:

x = 4y + 32

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 32) - 32 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 64 - 32 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 32 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 32 = 0

Subtract 32 from both sides:

4y = -32

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220.

$220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

In three years, their ages will be:
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Harriet's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Adrian's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 (Naomi) - 44 (Yuri) - 85 (Brianna) = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, which is 30 liters. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and then add it to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100: (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 48%.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the costs of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

The base burrito costs $6.50.
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

The upgrade costs $3.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the extra items and the upgrade to the base burrito price: $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"To determine the time it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest initially. 

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. The remaining melons would be 120 - 36 = 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

To find out how many melons were not ready, we subtract the number of melons ready from the total remaining melons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into three parts: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 
   12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

2. Tax on the cars:
   10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

3. Registration fees for the cars:
   12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add up the costs:
$240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The total cost Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to find the total number of insects in the garden. Since the problem doesn't mention any other types of insects, we can assume that the total number of insects is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left sunbathing is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's tomato consumption.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make one new pen, Ram will have 5 new pens. However, he also has the 25 original pens, so the total number of pens he has is:

5 (new pens) + 25 (original pens) = 30 pens

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is 21."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of books each person has and the number of books they read.

Dolly has 2 books.
Pandora has 1 book.

Since they read each other's books as well as their own, we can calculate the total number of books they read as follows:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.
- Pandora reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, for a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Now, we add the total number of books they read: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

So, Dolly and Pandora collectively read 6 books by the end.

"To find the total number of letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and sends.

He receives 2 letters per week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we multiply her sister's cookies on Tuesday by 2.

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school:
Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 students

We know that the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the first two classes
= 1.5 classes - 27

= 3 - 27
= -24 (this is incorrect, as we can't have a negative number of students)
Let's recalculate the total number of girls:
Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes
Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school:
Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 students
We know that the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the first two classes
= 1.5 classes - 27
= 3 - 27
= 30 - 27
= 3

Since the total number of girls is 1.5 classes, we can assume that the third class has 1 girl (as 0.5 classes would mean 10 students, which is not possible). Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class:
Number of boys in the third class = Total number of students - Number of girls in the third class

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate. 

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is 30% expressed as a decimal). 

Weight of eaten wood = 400 pounds * 0.3 = 120 pounds

Now, we need to find the weight of the remaining wood. Since the total weight of the redwood is the weight of the eaten wood plus the weight of the remaining wood, we can subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight.

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight - Weight of eaten wood
Weight of remaining wood = 400 pounds - 120 pounds
Weight of remaining wood = 280 pounds

Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the height by the weight per section.

Total weight = Height * Weight per section
Total weight = 200 feet * 400 pounds/10 feet
Total weight = 800 pounds

However, this is the total weight of the redwood, not the weight of the remaining wood. To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of the eaten wood to the weight of the remaining wood.

Total weight = Weight of remaining wood + Weight of eaten wood
Total weight = 280 pounds + 120 pounds

"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to first calculate the cost of the overdue books and then add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she owes a flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount she owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
= 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
= 128

The final answer is 128."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can calculate the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."

"To find the total amount of money the girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money the girls have combined is $400."
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater. 
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The number of stitches for each sleeve is 315."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals they have is 1/10 of the total number of medals given out. 

Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. Then, we can set up the equation: 39 = T/10.

To find T, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: T = 39 * 10 = 390.

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to first calculate the total miles driven per year. 

Since John drives to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile driven is $2, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, and since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is 150 * 12 = $1,800.

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total money spent) = $15.

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

The total number of books she has sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135.

Since there are 250 books in total, and 50 are unsold, the number of books she has sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Now, we can find the number of books she sold in the first year by subtracting the number of books sold in the second year from the total number of books sold in the first two years: 200 - 45 = 155.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books she sold in the second year is 90 - 45 = 45.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900.

The final answer is: 900"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings for 20 days of work are 20 days * $10/hour = $200.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. 

So, his total earnings for April are $200 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $500.

"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people.

20% of 20 is 0.2 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

Therefore, Sandy will also take 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can see a pattern. The person will grow 1 extra arm in 3 days, 1 extra leg in 5 days, and this pattern will repeat.

In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms (1 in 3 days, 1 in 6 days, 1 in 9 days, 1 in 12 days, and 1 in 15 days) and 3 extra legs (1 in 5 days, 1 in 10 days, and 1 in 15 days).

So, the total number of new limbs the person will grow is 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that gives us $500 + $700 = $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost: $1950 - $2000 = -$50. However, since you can't spend a negative amount, we need to recalculate the total cost without the flight ticket. 

Let's recalculate the total cost without the flight ticket: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) = $750.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that P = (1/2)P_now, where P_now is the current population of Chile. We can set up the equation:

P = (1/2)P_now

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)P_now

We can also substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)(2P_now)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(N - 6) = P_now

Now we can substitute the expression for N from the first equation:

3000((1/2)(C - 6) + 6) = P_now

Substituting C = 46, we get:

3000((1/2)(46 - 6) + 6) = P_now

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(20 + 6) = P_now

3000(26) = P_now

96000 = P_now

The current population of Chile is 96000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who could attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since we know the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation 3x = 45. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 15. 

So, the number of electric poles required is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we can subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men and add the number of people who left.

Number of men who left = 1/4 * 25 = 6.25 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 6 = 19

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.

Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Number of men who stayed
= 40 - 19
= 21

Therefore, 21 women are left at the party.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's represent the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. However, we can try to find a whole number solution by re-examining the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. We can try to find a whole number solution by assuming that the number of pencils in each box is a whole number.

Let's try to find a whole number solution by trial and error. 

If we assume that each box has 8 pencils, then Jam has 3 * 8 + 2 = 26 pencils. This satisfies the condition.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 
Jam has 3 * 8 + 2 = 26 pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 26 + 46 = 72.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed:
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

Next, we need to calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, but it doesn't specify the weakening effect of the cream. However, since the problem asks for the total weakening effect, we can assume that the weakening effect of the cream is negligible compared to the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Therefore, we can ignore the weakening effect of the cream.

The total weakening effect of the coffee is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the added cream (which we assume to be negligible):

Total weakening effect = 60 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. However, we know that 5 people come in, so the total number of old records traded is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since 7 new records are left, we can set up the equation: 10 old records = 7 new records.

However, this equation doesn't make sense because we can't trade 10 old records for 7 new records. We need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-examine the problem. If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, it means they traded 5 new records for old records. Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded for 5 new records is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since 5 people come in, the total number of old records brought in is 10 + 5 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate the salary of a senior programmer as follows:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $224000

The final answer is: $224000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

Let's break it down:

- Total people heading to the third stop: 20
- People who got off at the second stop: 7
- People who got on at the second stop: 8

First, subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total:
20 - 7 = 13

Then, add the people who got on at the first stop:
13 + 5 = 18

Therefore, 18 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After eating 3 more lollipops that night, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

The customer spent $80 initially. They used their rewards for $1 off for every $20 spent, which is $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. So, they got $4 off.

However, the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off, which is $4 * 2 = $8. 

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The job with the higher net pay rate is Job B, with a net pay of $32,400. To find the difference, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

2c = 2 * 20 = 40

Now that we know the number of chickens and cows, we can calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation. Let's call the total time spent on vacation 'x'. 

30% of x is equal to 15 hours, so 0.3x = 15. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 in change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy he bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance covered in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services every 20 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 

For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken for the detour = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to come back home
Total time = 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours

The final answer is: 8.86"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

87"
"To find the number of boys in the park, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys and girls together.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points = 42
Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33

The minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

And the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:

3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find Erin's initial score, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before Erin scored 14 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation: 
Let Sara's initial score be x. 
Erin's score = 3 * Sara's initial score 
14 = 3x 
x = 14 / 3 
x = 4.67 

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before Erin scored 14 points. 

To find Erin's initial score, we need to add the 14 points she scored to Sara's initial score: 
Erin's initial score = Sara's initial score + 14 
Erin's initial score = 4.67 + 14 
Erin's initial score = 18.67 

The final answer is 18.67."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 44 * 0.25 = 11 seniors will receive cords.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132
- Total cost for senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1298

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1298."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan is making his own, he will save 20% on the materials cost. 

Let's assume the cost of the materials is x. Then, 20% of x is 0.2x. 

The total cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is the sum of the cost of the materials and the cost of the original wallpaper. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 400 = 0.8x (since 100% - 20% = 80%)

Now, let's solve for x: 
x + 400 = 0.8x
400 = 0.8x - x
400 = 0.8x - 0.8x + 0.2x
400 = 0.2x
x = 400 / 0.2
x = 2000

Now that we know the cost of the materials is $2000, we can find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper:
Total cost = cost of materials + cost of original wallpaper
Total cost = 2000 + 400
Total cost = 2400

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $2400."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours from each day. 

Hallie had 1 hour of practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add the hours from each day: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

The total hours of dance practice per week is 5 hours.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. 

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Then, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

400,000 = (number of functioning pieces) * price per piece

We know that the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

However, we don't know the price per piece. We can express the total amount spent as:

400,000 = 0.6x * price per piece

To find the price per piece, we need more information. However, we can express the total amount spent as a percentage of the total number of pieces:

400,000 = 0.6x * price per piece
400,000 = 0.6x * (400,000 / x)
400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000
400,000 = 240,000

This equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that the total amount spent is equal to itself, which is not possible. This is because we assumed that the price per piece is constant, but we don't know the actual price per piece.

However, we can express the total amount spent as a percentage of the total number of pieces:

400,000 = 0.6x * price per piece
400,000 = 0.6x * (400,000 / x)
400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000

To find the price per piece, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

price per piece = 400,000 / 0.6
price per piece = 666,667

Now we can find the total amount spent on functioning pieces:

total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x * price per piece
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is $240,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as:

40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who do not like blue. This is the remaining half of the class:

40 - 20 = 20 pupils do not like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we can calculate this as:

20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Now, we subtract the pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow:

20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine the number of apples picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine how many socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies initially: 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away: 65 + 44 = 109

Now, let's subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 109 = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for calculating monthly interest is: 
Monthly interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 12

Given values: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Monthly interest = (3650 * 0.10 * 5) / 12
Monthly interest = 146.88

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we add the monthly interest to the principal amount to get the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Principal + Monthly interest
Monthly payment = 3650 + 146.88
Monthly payment = 3796.88

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3796.88."

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To determine the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade will be 36 cups * $1 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies.

The profit from selling all the lemonade is the total revenue minus the total cost of supplies, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

32"
"To find the initial number of female members, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. Since the choir is performing with just its female members, the number of people performing initially is 26.

However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 26, which is 13. 

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people performing. 

The total number of people singing in the performance is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16."

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Next, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we convert the total energy used to kilowatt-hours:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

The new total energy usage in 30 days:
2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

Converting this to kilowatt-hours:
81,000 Wh / 1000 = 81 kWh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new total energy usage:
216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
There's one zebra with 36 stripes. 
The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the first two, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of each needed for 20 people as follows:

- Meat: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- Cheese: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- Total cost of meat: 5 sandwiches * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Total cost of cheese: 5 sandwiches * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns Allan initially had. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
= 2 * 40
= 80

Next, we need to find the number of corns Allan bought. We know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is:

Number of corns bought = Number of cannolis - 40
= 40 - 40
= 0

Now, we can find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house by adding the initial number of corns, the number of corns bought, and the initial number of cannolis:

Total number of corns = Initial number of corns + Number of corns bought
= 80 + 0
= 80

Total number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + Number of cannolis bought
= 40 + 0
= 40

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
Total = Total number of corns + Total number of cannolis
= 80 + 40
= 120"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog):
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Now, we find 1% of the defective candles (will explode):
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount first. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister's T = 2 * 30 = 60.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the known values, we get:

30 + 15 + A = 500

Combine the constants:

45 + A = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:

A = 455

Therefore, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 455"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into equation (2) to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Now, we need to find the difference between 6,000 feet and Oliver's current elevation of 3,000 feet. 

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole saved a total of $6 from both jeans. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is (1/3)x, and the rest from the tattered jeans, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

We know that the total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. Since the tattered jeans cost $6 more than the jogger jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The 6 minibusses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The 10 minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

10 = 30

This equation is not true, which means that our initial assumption is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he has after selling the cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he sells 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) + $50 (the spending cash) = $150.

So, we can set up the equation: (2/3)x * $1.5 = $150.

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get x * $1.5 = $225.

Then, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to get x = $225 / $1.5.

x = 150

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which equals 7. 

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents.

Now, we can subtract the amount of money he had left from the amount he had after buying chips to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of a candy bar to find out how many he bought. 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people.

Now, we add the total number of oranges they have: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and the total amount of beef stock needed.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. Since each pound costs $2.00, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus spends 3 hours baking. So, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Total hay = Distance * 0.5
Total hay = 16 * 0.5
Total hay = 8 bails

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 * 3
Total cost = 24 dollars

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * 5
Total money = 30 dollars

Now, we can calculate the change:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = 30 - 24
Change = 6 dollars

"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman initially spent $576 on the case of sneakers. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the price of a regular movie ticket as 'x' and the price of a regular popcorn as 'y'. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $12 + $1 (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $16. 

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $x + y + $1 (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = x + y + 4.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation: x + y + 4 = 16 - 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + y + 4 = 14.

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get x + y = 10.

Since the cost of the movie ticket is $12, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation x + y = 10.

12 + y = 10

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get y = -2.

However, the price of a popcorn cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption that the cost of the movie ticket is $12 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The cost of the super ticket is $16. The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $16 + $2 = $18.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. The cost of the popcorn and soda together is $18 - $12 = $6.

Since the cost of the soda is $3, the cost of the popcorn is $6 - $3 = $3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 45. This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Now, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the new cost by 170: 65 * 170 = 11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week. 

Her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents.
Her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents.

Total weekly earnings from recycling are 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson earns 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. 

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. 

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's money and add it to Ali's initial amount.

Leila's half of her money is $100 / 2 = $50.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 + 200 = 350. 

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. 

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9.

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of laundry pieces, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of laundry pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of laundry pieces in 80 rooms:
15 pieces per room * 80 rooms = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = 100 - 180 = -80

Since Fireman Frank can't have a negative number of shoes, this means he will have 0 shoes on Sunday.

"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. 

She has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans she needs: 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen, which is 3 * $2 = $6. 

Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, its cost is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                    = 1/3 * 240
                                    = 80

Therefore, there are 80 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the shark's body length and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20
total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time required to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (7 days). 

240 minutes / 7 days = 34.29 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.29 minutes each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks.

34.29"
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book to find the total number of books:

300 / 15 = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child received:

20 / 4 = 5

So, each child received 5 books.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances (dairy or peanuts). 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group and then add the number of tour guides.

Number of groups: 3
Number of employees in each group: 200
Number of tour guides: 7

Total number of employees: 3 * 200 = 600
Total number of tour guides: 7

Total number of people going on the tour: 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel for 3 days. 

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive for a busy weekend, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 

So, the price of the hotel for 3 days is $1500 + $300 = $1800. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel. 

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. 

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 + $1800 = $11,800.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, for a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and multiply it by the cost per orange.

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the cost per orange.
24 * 10 = 240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this consumption. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 

To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost for 2 packs will be the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine the number of guests required for both venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The total cost for the first venue is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The total cost for the second venue is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is 25x.

To find the point at which both venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can express the number of insects David found as B/2.

Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found can be expressed as B/2 + 7.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David's insects = B/2 = 24/2 = 12

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily's insects = B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19

Weekly cost without pass = Cost per trip * Trips per week
Weekly cost without pass = $2.20 * 5
Weekly cost without pass = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost with the pass:
Weekly cost with pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the weekly cost with the pass from the weekly cost without the pass:
Savings = Weekly cost without pass - Weekly cost with pass
Savings = $11.00 - $20
Savings = -$9.00

Since we can't have negative savings, it means that buying a weekly bus pass would actually cost Janet $9 more than not buying one."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

There are 30 days in a month, so 8 months is 8 * 30 = 240 days. Adding the 20 days, he has a total of 240 + 20 = 260 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 260 days ≈ 404 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 404 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot, which is x + 3x = 4x. We know the total cost is $120,000, so we can set up the equation 4x = 120,000.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000. 

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply 30,000 by 3 to get the cost of the house: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is 90,000."
"To find the total cost of the canvas bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
$64 - $32 = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total number of minutes in the fight is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how long it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first calculate the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. Since there were 100 problems in total, one-quarter of 100 is 25. 

The total number of problems completed so far is 48 + 25 = 73.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 73 = 27.

Chris has 27 math problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29."

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Now, we need to find the rate at which 5 people paint the house. Since the rate is additive, we can multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs: 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 86."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how much he spent on the headphone set. 

We know Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week and the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks - 2 weeks with 5 hours). 
Total hours for these weeks = 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
Total hours for these weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
Total hours for this week = 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the total hours for all the weeks:
Total hours = 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40 passengers. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to the number who got off (21), which is 21 / 3 = 7 passengers. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.

Therefore, after the second stop, there are 66 passengers riding the bus.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the total cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the total cost of the monitors:

Total cost of monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Total cost of monitors = $2,400 - $700
Total cost of monitors = $1,700

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can divide the total cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls. Since the girls are divided into two equal groups, the number of girls is half of 20, which is 10.

300 shells / 10 girls = 30 shells per girl.

The final answer is 30."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the target for the first half of the month: $1125 / 2 = $562.50.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the target for the first half by 2: $562.50 * 2 = $1125.

Now, we need to find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month. There are 15 days in the second half of April.

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money ($100) by 5, since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. The total amount of money is the sum of what Jeff and Brad get, which is x + 4x = 5x. We know this sum is equal to $100.

5x = 100

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we multiply x by 4 to find Jeff's share:

Jeff's share = 4x
Jeff's share = 4 * 20
Jeff's share = 80

The final answer is 80."

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time for 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time for 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time for 3 miles on a cold day from the time for 3 miles on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $80, we divide the target savings by his weekly earnings:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The total cost of lunch is $160."
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, and each of these buttons has 4 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to calculate the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Change in angle = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). 

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 90 - 50
New angle = 40 degrees

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the number of candles per pack is 5, we can divide the number of sons by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

12 (older son) / 5 = 2.4 (round up to 3 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)
8 (younger son) / 5 = 1.6 (round up to 2 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, James needs to buy 3 packs of candles for the older son and 2 packs for the younger son. 

3 (packs for the older son) + 2 (packs for the younger son) = 5 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost is 5 packs * $3 = $15.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial amount: 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received half of that amount for each of the last two teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote Mark's goals as M. 
M + 20 = 80 
M = 80 - 20 
M = 60 

Now, we know Mark scored 60 goals. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can set up another equation: 
Let's denote Anna's goals as A. 
A + 45 = 80 
A = 80 - 45 
A = 35 

Now that we know the number of goals each teenager scored, we can add them up to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers. 
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals 
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35 
Total goals = 175 

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, let's find out how much Liam made. We already know that Liam made $63.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

Difference = Total amount Mitchell made - Total amount Liam made
Difference = $84 - $63
Difference = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spent: $20 (wooden action figures) + $6 (plastic action figures) = $26.

Since Peter started with $70, he has $70 - $26 = $44 left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money. For the wooden action figures, he can buy $44 / $5 = 8.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of an action figure, he can buy 8 wooden action figures.

For the plastic action figures, he can buy $44 / $2 = 22.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures.

Total number of action figures = 8 + 22 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops and then subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 20 * 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 15 * 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

The total number of roses required by the shops in a month is 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required: 260 - 160 = 100.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

Total amount removed = $100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to first determine the total cost and total revenue.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = (Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves) + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Total cost = ($3.00 * 10) + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00

The net profit of the food truck is $10.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Since each muffin crayon requires 8 small pieces of crayons, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make: 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, we can multiply the number of muffin crayons by the selling price to find out how much money Kate can make: 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $10512."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide by the number of days.

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days

"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature for the recipe. 

The recipe calls for 520 degrees. To find the correct temperature, we add 4% of 520 to 520: 
520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she must have brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 45 = $4.00 per pair

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill's earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
John's earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99 * 1500
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01 * 1500
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial increase from the second measurement: 52 - 5 = 47. 

Now, we add this increase to the initial measurement to get the third measurement: 47 + 47 = 94 WPM.

The average of the three measurements is (47 + 52 + 94) / 3 = 193 / 3 = 64.33 WPM."
"To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 5 * 1.75 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight after 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will bring 2 friends, so the number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Additionally, Alex invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the number of additional guests from her friends is 10 * 2 = 20.

The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 invited people, the additional guests from the initial invitations, and the additional guests from her friends: 100 + 200 + 20 = 320.

Therefore, Alex will need 320 seats for the event.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping, since it costs twice as much as on Amazon) = $21.

The difference in cost between the two platforms is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 * 2 = 8 feet tall. It is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 * 2 = 16 feet tall. It is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 * 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find the total amount of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert all the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he finds it too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 1: 10 + 12 = 22 games.

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 10 + 24 = 34 games.

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 more for Christmas, so he has 10 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 10 + 48 = 58 games.

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 58."
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours separately and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year.

First, we need to find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a month. Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the number of miles driven per month to get the total number of rotations per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of rotations per month by 12 to get the total number of rotations per year:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the total number of rotations per year (1,740,000) to find out how many years the tire will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will last for 6 years before it needs to be replaced.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the total cost by the number of washings per pump. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 60
Cost per pump = $0.40

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $0.40 * 100
Cost per pump = 40 cents

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost: $52.50 * 0.30 = $15.75.

Now, we subtract the total cost and sales tax from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $52.50 - $15.75 = -$17.25.

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $17.25.

Final answer: $-17.25"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by each player:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Total posts = Number of members * Posts per day * Number of days in March
Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93,000."

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:
15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg/day

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg):
750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To determine the total number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we subtract $400 from the price of gold.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and the cost per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since the cost per class is $10, we can divide the total cost by the cost per class to find the maximum number of classes his parents will allow.

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

However, Manny has already signed up for 10 classes. So, his parents will only sign him up for 6 classes. 

To find out how many classes he can miss before they won't sign him up again, we subtract the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes his parents will allow.

6 (maximum allowed classes) - 10 (classes signed up for) = -4

Since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, we can conclude that his parents won't sign him up again after he misses 4 classes.

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

The bonus amount is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67

Now, we add the raise amount and the bonus amount to his current salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $22666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$22666.67 * 12 = $272000

The final answer is: $272000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

The first website publishes 20 articles per day, and the second website publishes 10 articles per day. 

Total articles per day = 20 (political) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is:

Total articles in February = 30 articles per day * 28 days = 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Each bag contains 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since he wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total cupcakes needed = 27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

54"
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Simplifying the equation:
x + 22000 = 70x

Subtract x from both sides:
22000 = 69x

Divide both sides by 69:
x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45

Since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to 319.

Now, we need to find the total number of likes. We add the initial number of likes to the new likes:
319 + 20000 = 20119

The total number of likes is 20119."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Sheila paid more than Clara. The correct answer is the absolute value of the difference:
$142"
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales from green hats. 

Let's denote the sales from green hats as G. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount from green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, to find the total sales for the first month, we add the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from both months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the next two hours is 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first hour and the cost of the next two hours: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to get the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice that, which is $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel cost: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is the monthly cost multiplied by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost for the first year is $150,000 (initial cost) + $180,000 (monthly cost for 12 months) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference in cost = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, subtracting this equation from the first equation (4s + 2g = 70), we get 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

Now that we know the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting s = 15 into the second equation: 15 + g = 20.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get g = 5.

Therefore, Lee has 15 sheep and 5 geese on his farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5, which is $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2. The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and the bottle of soda ($1.00), we get: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find out how many recipes he learns.

48 / 1.5 = 32

John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by the percentage of math teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3.
Each person's share = Total money / 3
Each person's share = $360 / 3
Each person's share = $120

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the first 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The remaining 10 days were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the updated count of good days is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15.

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the target height (600 inches) by the growth rate (30 inches/day).

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since 3 dogs were gone, there were 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

Since Skyler's investment accounted for the rest, Skyler invested 240 dollars.

"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as 'x'. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can write an equation: 
68 = x - 5

To find the value of 'x', we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
x = 68 + 5
x = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has:
73 - 12 = 61 cookies

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
73 + 23 = 96 cookies

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:
Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Time spent walking to the school = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Time spent walking to the school
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we need to first determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (by Greta) + 60 (by Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y:

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

If y = 5, then 3y = 15, and 2x = 19. Solving for x, we get x = 9.5, which is not an integer.

If y = 6, then 3y = 18, and 2x = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 8.

If y = 7, then 3y = 21, and 2x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 6.5, which is not an integer.

If y = 8, then 3y = 24, and 2x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

If y = 9, then 3y = 27, and 2x = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 3.5, which is not an integer.

If y = 10, then 3y = 30, and 2x = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

If y = 11, then 3y = 33, and 2x = 11. Solving for x, we get x = 5.5, which is not an integer.

If y = 12, then 3y = 36, and 2x = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

If y = 13, then 3y = 39, and 2x = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 2.5, which is not an integer.

If y = 14, then 3y = 42, and 2x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

If y = 15, then 3y = 45, and 2x = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 0.

Since x should be a positive integer, the only valid solution is x = 8 and y = 6.

The age of one of the twins is 8 years."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, and there are 12 months in a year, Rong has been saving for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, the total number of coins he has saved is 20 * 120 = 2400.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. Therefore, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 * 120 = 3360.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total cost, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

We also know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total area of the comforter, we need to find the total number of colored squares and multiply it by the area of each square (1 square foot).

Let's start by finding the number of blue squares. We know there are 14 red squares and 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we know there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

We also know there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can find the total number of colored squares by adding the number of red, blue, green, and white squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to find the total number of chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add the number of adults and babies to find the total number of people:

Total number of people = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies)
= 57

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs

"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). 

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

Total drinks consumed = 14 people * 2 drinks/person = 28 drinks
Total snacks consumed = 14 people * 3 snacks/person = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (Total drinks * $2) + (Total snacks * $2)
Total cost = (28 * $2) + (42 * $2)
Total cost = $56 + $84
Total cost = $140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the weight capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. So, the combined weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find the weight capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total weight capacity of all three trucks. So, Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: 2,800."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. Therefore, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can find out how much money he had initially by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the ratio of his part (3/5). 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we subtract the amount he spent ($10) from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, as the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Hourly rate = Amount already raised / Number of hours already worked
= $2100 / 3
= $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours needed = Amount still needed / Hourly rate
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have received from the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually loses $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is -255."
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices.

Initially, there were 5 pizzas, each with 12 slices, making a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices in a pizza, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. 

The total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 8. 

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices in a pizza, they ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

Now, subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43 slices.

There are 43 slices of pizza left."
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we can find the total number of spools by adding the number of light green and dark green spools to the total blue spools.

Total spools = 60 (blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 

By 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

The remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (voted by 8:00) + 2000 (voted by 16:00) = 4000 people.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces). 

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5 days per pack

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know that her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. 

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The weight of her history book is twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes received by candidate A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of apples they have after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

After Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

The difference in the number of apples Beck has than Boris now is 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The water Peter has left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Steven's books = 20
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books: 
20 - 16 = 4

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 12. 

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, not the total number of groups.

To find the number of additional groups needed, we can subtract the number of groups already required from the total number of groups needed. 

Total groups needed = 54 students / 4 students per group = 13.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 14 groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the initial trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. 
So, she has a total of 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of the second house, so if we let x be the number of cases needed for the second house, then the first house needs x/2 cases.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house = 2 * (100) = 200

The third house needs 200 cases of shingles.

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read.

300 + 150 = 450

Therefore, Ezra and Ahmed have read 450 books altogether.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Additionally, she earns $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since she teaches 2 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
$65 + $30 = $95

The final answer is: $95"
"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

The difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents is 20 - 16 = 4.

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to earn $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to earn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he has 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he has 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The number of wheels left is 276."
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to be paid.

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we can calculate the cost of the movies in series. Since they cost $6 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Next, we can calculate the cost of the older movies. Since they cost $5 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

Finally, we can calculate the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 normal movies and each costs $10, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 400 * $10
= $4000

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $4000
= $5000

The final answer is: $5000"
"To find the total cost of the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the time they spent driving. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's points:
- She collects 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 40 + 900 = 1020.

The difference between their scores is 1020 - 820 = 200.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
2 pizzas * 30 dollars/pizza = 60 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost:
64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
4 dollars / 2 = 2 dollars

The other two pizzas cost 2 dollars each."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.

On the extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times/day. Since there are 2 extra days, that's 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 9 times + 12 times = 21 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took 17 fish from the pet store, Bob had 3 + x orange fish and 4 - y white fish, where x is the number of orange fish he bought and y is the number of white fish he bought.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x = 2(4 - y)

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can set up another equation:

x + y = 17

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

First, let's solve the second equation for y:

y = 17 - x

Now, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

3 + x = 2(4 - (17 - x))

Expand and simplify:

3 + x = 8 - 17 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 + x = -9 + 2x

Subtract x from both sides:

3 = -9 + x

Add 9 to both sides:

12 = x

Now that we know x, we can find y:

y = 17 - x
y = 17 - 12
y = 5

So Bob bought 5 white fish.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the total weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles per week.

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven / Fuel efficiency
Weekly fuel consumption = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost as follows:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

First, let's calculate the amount from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by 0.25 to get the total amount from the quarters.

140 * 0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount from the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 10 by 20 to get the total amount from the twenties.

10 * 20 = $200

However, Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of $200, we multiply 200 by 3/5.

200 * 3/5 = $120

So, Carrie spent $120 from the twenties. Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount she had from the twenties.

$200 - $120 = $80

Now, we add the amount she spent from the quarters and the remaining amount she spent from the twenties.

$35 + $80 = $115

Therefore, Carrie paid $115 for lunch.

"To determine the number of logs needed, we first need to find the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

The number of logs needed can be calculated by dividing the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log, which is 5 degrees. 

Number of logs needed = (32 - 12) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups. Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups.

90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know there are 10 groups. Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10.

3/5 * 10 = 6

This means 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Each of these groups had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount paid to employees in a month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid to employees after three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3:

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has: 200 - 150 = 50.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 101."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Initially, they had 35 marshmallows. After using 18, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they have 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids. 

14 / 2 = 7

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.
- The better friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest, we can express the amount of oil as 2 * 2z = 4z.

We know that the total amount of ingredients should add up to 10 ounces. The total amount of ingredients is the sum of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Since the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, we can express the total amount of ingredients as z + z + 4z + z + z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get z = 10/8 = 1.25.

Now that we know the amount of citrus zest, we can find the amount of oil. Since the amount of oil is 4z, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.

"To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required.

Total cupcakes required = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes required - Cupcakes already available
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which equals 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:

Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time by adding the time she walked on both days:

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (in minutes) = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time (in minutes) = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot at that time.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Then, 1/2 of the cars left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week. 

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is 150 * 7 = 1050 tasks.

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in a week is 1050 * $1.20 = $1260.

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

She records 18 videos per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, she records 18 * 4 = 72 videos in a month.

She spends 2 hours per week writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. In a month, she spends 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

She spends 15 minutes per day, six days a week, doing her makeup. In a month, she spends 15 * 6 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add the time she spends on recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup: 72 + 480 + 360 = 912 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 912 / 60 = 15.2 hours.

The cost of the additional mirrors is 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. 
The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 = 3 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 3 * $15.00 = $45.00.

The standard installation cost is $129.00. 
The total cost is $129.00 + $45.00 = $174.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings.

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, their combined speed is:

Combined speed of turtles = 6 hours per kangaroo / 2
Combined speed of turtles = 3 hours per kangaroo

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Combined speed of turtles
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call that amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom: x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation: 
x + $150 + $80 = $400 + $50

Simplifying the equation:

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the total number of pairs purchased:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The average cost per pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75. 

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. 

However, we get $2 off for each basket of red food, so we need to subtract $6 from the total cost of the red food. 

The total cost of the red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48. 

The total cost of the green food remains $75. 

The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123. 

123"
"To find the total time required to clean half of the rooms, we need to calculate the time for half of 90 rooms. 

First, we find half of 90: 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time per room: 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 900 / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for a numerical answer. 

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need 7 packs of glue sticks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

14000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 infected people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 infected people.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 
Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is $800 + $720 = $1520."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We can subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the number of yellow cars: 
75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of jello needed, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. 

There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. 

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had (52) to the marbles his friend gave him (28). This gives us 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend. 1/4 of 80 is 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost (20) from the total marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend (80). This gives us 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the scores from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we need to first calculate the total revenue he will generate from selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens at $50 per chicken.

Total chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total revenue - Desired profit
Total cost = $9000 - $2000
Total cost = $7000

Now, to find the cost of one chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens sold.

Cost per chicken = Total cost / Number of chickens sold
Cost per chicken = $7000 / 180 chickens
Cost per chicken = $38.89

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people in total. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is 3.33."

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to buy the rope for $2 per meter, so the total amount she can get for the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she can get for the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. In 10 years, she will be 18. So, we can write the equation as:

x + 10 = 3x

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 

Subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation:
10 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:
5 = x

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 5, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 5 = 15. Since she is currently 5, we need to find the difference between 15 and 5:
15 - 5 = 10

So, it will take 10 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 * 2 = $20. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since Kelly can't have a negative amount of money, this means she has overspent her budget."

"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired. 

Let's denote the total number of microphones as 'T' and the number of microphones that were successfully paired as 'P'. We know that 20% of the microphones couldn't find space, so the number of microphones that couldn't fit is 20% of T, or 0.2T.

Since the singer has 50 microphones, we can set up the equation:

T - 0.2T = P

We also know that the number of microphones in each pair is 2, so the total number of pairs is P/2.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

0.8T = P

Since P is the number of microphones that were successfully paired, we can also express it as:

P = 0.8T

We know that T = 50, so:

P = 0.8 * 50
P = 40

Now, we can find the number of pairs by dividing P by 2:

P/2 = 40/2
P/2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds in the bushes = 6
Number of birds flying overhead = 6 * (2/3) = 4

Next, we find the total number of birds feeding. Since there are 3 groups of 8 birds each, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

Number of birds feeding = 3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding to get the total number of birds.

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $11 for her daily goods, which include 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (carrots) + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Now, let's solve for the cost of the carrots:

2 (carrots) + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11
2 (carrots) + 9 = 11
2 (carrots) = 2

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one carrot:

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: 480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 8x * $6 = $48x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $48x.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact amount she made from lemonade sales. We can only express it in terms of 'x'. 

But we can find the value of 'x' by using the information that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times, and she was paid $6 for each time, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for 'x', we get x = 1.

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales: $80 - $48x = $80 - $48(1) = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total monthly hours are 10 * 3 = 30 hours. 

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation to find Joseph's initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Joseph's initial number of notebooks as J. We know that Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, so we can write the equation:

3J = 7

To find J, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

J = 7 / 3
J = 2.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Joseph initially had 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 - 2 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis's distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, while Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can hold 8 bowls of soup (the larger number).

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup for the children.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50.

The total amount William spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks, 2 yards of material can make 4 masks. To make 20 small masks, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sets of 4 masks. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, we multiply 5 sets by 2 yards to get 10 yards of material for the small masks.

For large masks, 2.25 yards of material can make 3 masks. To make 8 large masks, we divide 8 by 3 to get 2.67 sets of 3 masks. Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, we multiply 2.67 sets by 2.25 yards to get approximately 6 yards of material for the large masks.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, we need to find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
14 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find the number of blue shoeboxes left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the total number of blue shoeboxes. 

Number of blue shoeboxes left = Total blue shoeboxes - Blue shoeboxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find the number of red shoeboxes left, we first calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoeboxes.

Number of red shoeboxes used = 1/3 * Total red shoeboxes
= 1/3 * 9
= 3

Now, we subtract the number of red shoeboxes used from the total number of red shoeboxes.

Number of red shoeboxes left = Total red shoeboxes - Red shoeboxes used
= 9 - 3
= 6

The number of red shoeboxes left is 6, and the number of blue shoeboxes left is 4.

"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to calculate the acres of each farm and then add them together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so we multiply 200 by 2 and add 100: 
200 * 2 = 400
400 + 100 = 500

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 + 500 = 700

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total distance driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the amount of water remaining after 6 days by subtracting 500 gallons for each day.

5000 - 500 = 4500 gallons after 1 day
4500 - 500 = 4000 gallons after 2 days
4000 - 500 = 3500 gallons after 3 days
3500 - 500 = 3000 gallons after 4 days

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We don't know how many movies he's already seen on this Friday, but we know he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. Let's assume he's seen 5 movies on this Friday. If he's seen 5 movies on this Friday, he's already spent $10 * 5 = $50. If he's seen 0 movies on this Friday, he's already spent $0.

We also know he's seen 8 movies on other days, and each movie costs $7. So, he's spent $7 * 8 = $56 on other days.

Now, let's consider the two possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: Colby has seen 5 movies on this Friday.
In this case, he has $134 - $50 = $84 left. He can buy 84 / 10 = 8.4 movies, but since you can't buy a fraction of a movie, he can buy 8 movies.

Scenario 2: Colby hasn't seen any movies on this Friday.
In this case, he has $134 - $56 = $78 left. He can buy 78 / 10 = 7.8 movies, but since you can't buy a fraction of a movie, he can buy 7 movies.

Since Colby wants to see a movie, we'll consider the scenario where he hasn't seen any movies on this Friday. In this case, he can buy 7 movies.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had was 4 x 2 = 8. Maria also had 1 balloon, so the total number of balloons was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given was 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (9) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: 67200"
"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 

The additional hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours. The cost for these additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor cost = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total labor cost is $70. However, since the rate is per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, the labor cost is $70.

The total cost of parts is $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $70 + $60
Total cost = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams, she has 6 and each costs $1.5, so the total revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and each costs $2, so the total revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and each costs $1.25, so the total revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the root crops together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To calculate the total commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper and then multiply it by the respective commission rates.

The total revenue from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30.
The total revenue from the sales of 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Now, we can calculate the commission for each newspaper:
- Commission from the New York Times: $30 * 10% = $30 * 0.10 = $3
- Commission from the Wall Street Journal: $150 * 8% = $150 * 0.08 = $12

The total commission is the sum of the commission from each newspaper: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus's age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. Therefore, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

First, we find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of 15-minute intervals.
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval.
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to convert both times to minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes before 12 a.m.
5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes after 12 a.m.

Now, we subtract the wake-up time from the sleep time: 600 - 355 = 245 minutes.

However, she also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. We need to add those minutes to the total sleep time: 245 + 23 = 268 minutes.

The final answer is: 268"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups. 

2/3 of 24 measuring cups is (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 24 measuring cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, there are 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of balls each boy picked up. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can deduce that Jeffrey carried 1 ball. 

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can conclude that Jordan carried 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

And we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A + 4A - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

The total distance traveled by the bird is the sum of the distances covered in each leg:
300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

Her friends threw her a surprise party at home and had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 
Total oranges = 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Then, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. 
Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
Total oranges given away = 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 
Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges kept and the oranges given away from the total oranges.
Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept - Oranges given away
= 240 - 60 - 80
= 100 oranges.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'x'. 
Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 30 - 10 
x = 20 
So Richard has 20 cherries. 
Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard has from the total number of cherries: 
60 - 20 = 40 
Jerry has 40 cherries. 
To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 
30 - 40 = -10 
However, since we can't have a negative number of cherries, we can say that Robert has 10 fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the respective price.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $520

The final answer is: 520"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days. 
Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

The price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

The final answer is: $100, $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:
1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The number of students leaving early is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert this to inches as well. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant (12 inches) plus the space between the plants (18 inches), which equals 30 inches.

To find the total number of plants Pat can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space required for each plant (30 inches). 

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used by sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is:
30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = 0.5

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the peeling and cooking time is the same as the saute time, which is 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6 (the number of shrimp she can peel per minute) to get 15 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we can add the peeling time to the cooking time. So, the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 10 minutes (cooking) = 25 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 25 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

25"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

However, the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, in the 2 hours after the air conditioner was turned off, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

To find the net cooling effect, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect:
18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. 

The time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 times that age when he saw it for the second time. 

So, the equation becomes: x + 75 = 3 * 30

Simplifying the equation: x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides: x = 15

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 1 check per month.
2. He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 1 check per month.
3. He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 2 checks per month.
4. He writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks per month: 1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

Multiply the total number of checks per month by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks per year.

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips made by the first plane, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane's flights are split between Greece, France, and Germany. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 0.75 = 66 flights. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22, and then divided by 2, which equals 11 flights.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam received $6 from his mother and twice as much from his father, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children. 

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find Helene's age by multiplying the average age by 2.

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4. Now, we can find the sum of their ages.

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 10 = 17

Since the total age is 20, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of the other three children's ages from the total age.

Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50.

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. The total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total weight of the watermelon is not given, but we can assume it's 1 unit for simplicity. 

Since each slice is 1/6 of the total weight, each adult gets 4/6 = 2/3 of the total weight, and each kid gets 2/6 = 1/3 of the total weight.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can multiply the fraction by 100. 

Adults: (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%

Kids: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time. 

Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 
Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 
Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 + (10 * $1.50) = $35.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
Weekly earnings = (Number of students * Cost per student) * Number of days rented per week
Weekly earnings = (10 * $35) * 3
Weekly earnings = $1050

To find the monthly earnings, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4
Monthly earnings = $1050 * 4
Monthly earnings = $4200

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $4200."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is:
4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Total porcupines = Initial female porcupines + Total babies born
= 30 + 48

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by the formula V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can plug these values into the formula:

V = 14 * 25 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 7.48 gallons, we can convert the volume to gallons by multiplying by 7.48:

1400 * 7.48 = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed:

10480 * 5.9 = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the total amount of water needed by the cost per gallon:

61920 * 0.10 = 6192

The cost to fill the pool is $6192."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue sticks first. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find the distance each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We also know that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old would be 3000 / 2 = 1500.

We also know that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The number of male students over 16 years old is 375, and the number of male students under 16 years old is 750. So, the total number of male students is 375 + 750 = 1125.

Now, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students to find the total number of female students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, during the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 28%
34% = 28%

However, this equation is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the initial charge is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) = 55%

Now, during the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%

We can simplify this equation:
x - 0.45 - 0.21 = 0.28
x - 0.66 = 0.28
x = 0.28 + 0.66
x = 0.94

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
x = 0.94 * 100 = 94%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

Final answer: 94"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is $10 * 40 = $400. 

She also earns $15 per hour from tips, but we don't know how many hours she works per week from tips. Let's assume she works x hours from tips per week. 

Her total weekly income is $400 (wage) + $15x (tips). 

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. 20% of $10,000 is $2,000. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we can set up the equation: 

$400 + $15x = $2,000 / number of weeks 

Since we don't know the number of weeks, let's represent it as 'w'. 

$400 + $15x = $2,000 / w 

We can rearrange the equation to solve for 'w': 

$15x = $2,000 / w - $400 

$15x = ($2,000 - $400w) / w 

$15xw = $2,000 - $400w 

$15xw + $400w = $2,000 

$w(15x + $400) = $2,000 

Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. We know that Janet works 40 hours a week from wages, so x = 40. 

$w(15*40 + $400) = $2,000 

$w(600 + $400) = $2,000 

$w(1,000) = $2,000 

w = $2,000 / $1,000 

w = 2 

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Price after 1 year = Initial price + (5% of initial price)
= $120 + (0.05 * $120)
= $120 + $6
= $126

Year 2: 
Price after 2 years = Price after 1 year + (5% of price after 1 year)
= $126 + (0.05 * $126)
= $126 + $6.30
= $132.30

Year 3: 
Price after 3 years = Price after 2 years + (5% of price after 2 years)
= $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30)
= $132.30 + $6.615
= $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

Now, the total number of guests is 61 (remaining from the initial number) + 30 (new arrivals) = 91.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, she will get 0.75 * 24 = 18 points from the easy questions.

The remaining questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since they are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 points from the difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.

36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'L' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'S'. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total amount earned from the sales can be represented as:

$12L + $4S = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$12L + $4(2L) = $120
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches.

Now, let's multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to get the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week: 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found by anyone else.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 60 were found by the Smith twins, so 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

However, 10 of those 40 eggs were not found by anyone else, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 12 = 480 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month is 480 * 30 = 14400 pounds.

The answer is 14400."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. 

We know that the price of the package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the package with 4 sandwiches is $6. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion:

3 / 2 = 6 / 4

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 4 = 6 * 2
12 = 12

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $3.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 + 6 = 14

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 14

Total number of balloons Sally carried into the school = 15 + 7 + 6 + 14 = 42

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and we want to split them equally among the graduates, we divide 4750 by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of small, medium, and large jelly beans. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move between each bottle.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move between each bottle. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move between each bottle:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost due to not working while in school, we need to consider the income Jim would have earned during those 4 years. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money lost due to not working: 
$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he would have earned during those 4 years with his new income: 
$75,000 per year * 4 years = $300,000

The total amount of money lost due to not working while in school is $100,000. To find out how much he needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to add the total amount of loans: 
$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

The total amount he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Now, let's calculate how long it would take to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000 per year: 
$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to get the total amount of fabric required: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920. 

We can write the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 0.375 days.

Now, multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day worked:
21 days * 0.375 days = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total days worked by 24:
7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours

Now, divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is 10."

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

160"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles.

2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed, so he needs to wash 5 sets of sheets per week. 

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he can do 3 loads per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads per year: 
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

The total number of movies watched in a weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from each year: 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount Imma feeds her cats (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation: 
Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can calculate Silvia's slices:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The total number of slices eaten is 31."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of algebra. Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can represent Betsy's part as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers, but we don't know how many pills Hannah needs. However, we can assume that the doctor will prescribe a standard number of pills for a broken arm, which is typically 10-20 pills. Let's assume 15 pills for this calculation. The cost of the painkillers is $4 * 15 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($60), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost of the doctor's visit is $150 + $200 + $60 + $12 = $422.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $422."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

First, we find 20% of 80 emails that don't require a response: 
20% of 80 = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responsive emails from the total:
80 - 16 = 64 emails

Now, we multiply the number of responsive emails by the number of days in a work week (5):
64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

247"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number eaten from the total number ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total postage cost, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of mailing all coupons is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The total postage cost is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving Sidney with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

300"
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store is offering a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter. 

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00."
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which makes 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

The number of additional guests is 28 - 20 = 8. 

The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48.

The total cost of the party is $125 (for the initial 20 guests) + $48 (for the additional guests) = $173.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 

315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day.

"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces in an hour. 

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 is 1.25 times 12)
Cost of 15 roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can convert $6.25 into quarters as follows:

$6.25 = 6 * $1 + 0.25
= 6 * 4 quarters + 1 quarter
= 24 quarters + 1 quarter
= 25 quarters

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed until the fourth train arrives.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives in 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train arrives. Since the second train arrives in 40 minutes, the third train arrives in 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train arrives. Since the third train arrives in 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives in 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives in 120 minutes. Therefore, the total waiting time for Paul is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x. The selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second). 

In 4 hours, each spring would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours).

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked halfway to the store, he would have walked 2 miles to get there. 

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk back home. Again, we use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home:

Total Time = Time to store + Time to home
Total Time = 1 hour + 0.5 hours
Total Time = 1.5 hours

The final answer is: 1.5"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.

"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type sold.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we need to calculate 15% of 300. 15% of 300 is 0.15 * 300 = 45.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. Since we have already accounted for 150 + 45 = 195 bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 195 = 105.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250."
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class lasting 40 minutes. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 7 days in a week. So, the total minutes in a week is 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 10080 is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 630 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week by adding the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total minutes spent on learning per week = 200 + 630 = 830 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total hours spent on learning per week = 830 / 60 = 13.83 hours.

The final answer is 13.83."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 270 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was half of the initial amount. Let's call the initial amount 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2
x = 540

So, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years.

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This implies that the number of large jellyfish is 6 + x/15.

Since the number of large jellyfish is x/5, we can set up the equation:

x/5 = 6 + x/15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15 to get:

3x = 90 + x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 45

Therefore, there are 45 jellyfish in the tank.

45"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of each person based on the given information.

We know Chris is 4 years old.

Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be her annual income minus her annual expenses, which is $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 20 years. 

The total amount she needs to save is her annual savings multiplied by the number of years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work: $1,200,000 / $20,000 = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has some savings, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide the number of years she has already worked. 

Therefore, we can only determine the number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement, which is 60 years."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to break down the problem into steps. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means we divide 100 by 4, which equals 25 centimeters per part.

Next, we take each of these 4 parts and divide them into 5 equal parts. This means we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters per final cut.

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

25"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the coupon discount.

First, let's add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we subtract the coupon discount: $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

Total height of heels = (3 * 4) + (3 * 2) = 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Total number of heels = 3 + 3 = 6

Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Total number of heels = 18 / 6 = 3 inches

The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30. 

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate the required daily distance as follows:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

However, she plans to hike 125 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract the planned daily distance from the required daily distance:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles more per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person will get, we need to calculate the total amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, I assume there is a mistake and it should be Pierre, not James. 

So, Pierre and Paul together want 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The remaining amount of apples will be 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were:

- Female goldfishes: 5

After Tate's purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

"To find the total time taken by all three, we need to calculate the time taken by each person.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time taken by each person: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time taken by all three to do their chores is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The distance for one round trip is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. 

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

To find the distance, we need to multiply the time by the speed. 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 70 * 8
Distance = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Brian will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x.

We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

Now, we can equate this to 2x: 2x = 70. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 35. 

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up for the remaining 20 toys in the 10-hour shift.

Let's calculate the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours to make up for the remaining 20 toys. 
20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

However, since the fifth worker needs to produce 2 toys in 10 hours, we can calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour by dividing 2 toys by 10 hours. 

2 toys / 10 hours = 0.2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 0.2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight. Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris initially had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 23 * 2 = 46 stickers initially.

The final answer is 46."
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Circumference of the earth = 40,000 kilometers
Half of the circumference = 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing the distance by his daily flight distance.

Number of days = 20,000 / 400 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed by multiplying the average car's speed by 5.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight in pounds is 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie and her brother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries. 

Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, let's denote her brother's salary as x. Then Valerie's salary is x/2. 

We know that their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2(x + x/2). 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 
2(x + x/2) = x + x/2 + x/2

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + x = 2x
3x = 2x
x = 0

This means Valerie's brother earns $0, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the temperature of the second mug is unknown. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x'. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(33 - 4) + (x - 1) = 5

Simplifying the equation:

29 + x - 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

28 + x = 5

Subtract 28 from both sides:

x = -23

However, the temperature cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption of the problem is incorrect. The problem statement implies that Donny can drink the water after pouring, which means the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Donny can drink the water after pouring, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x'. We know that the temperature of the first mug is 33 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(33 - 4) + (x - 1) = 40

Simplifying the equation:

29 + x - 1 = 40

Combine like terms:

28 + x = 40

Subtract 28 from both sides:

x = 12

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 3 scoops is. Since 3 less than 3 scoops is 0 scoops, we can say that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 0 scoops, we can divide 3 by 3, which equals 1. This means that 3 potatoes are needed to make 0 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 3 potatoes make 0 scoops, we can say that 6 potatoes make 2 scoops (because 3 potatoes make 0 scoops, and 3 more potatoes would make 2 scoops). 

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying 5 by 2, which equals 10. 

Therefore, Gomer ate 10 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is a multiplier for the ratio. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x. 

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus by multiplying the ratio of women (9) by x. 

Initial number of women = 9x
Initial number of women = 9 * 6
Initial number of women = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

Number of women who have remained = Initial number of women - 20
Number of women who have remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who have remained = 34

The final answer is 34."

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 3: 
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold: 
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. The revenue from selling 60% of his inventory is $84. To find the loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost: 100 - 84 = $16.

Adam loses $16.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is 3 times the number each person gets. Let's denote the number each person gets as 'y'. Then, the total number of seashells is 3y.

Now, we can set up the equation:

5x + 5 = 3y

We also know that the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write another equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 3y

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = 3y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

First, let's solve for x in terms of y from the first equation:

5x + 5 = 3y
5x = 3y - 5
x = (3y - 5) / 5

Now, substitute x into the second equation:

5((3y - 5) / 5) + 5 = 3y
3y - 5 + 5 = 3y
3y = 3y

This equation is true for any value of y. However, we can find a specific value for y by using the fact that the total number of seashells is a multiple of 3. 

Let's try y = 3. Then, x = (3*3 - 5) / 5 = 4. 

Now, we can find the number of seashells each person got:

Carlos collected 2x = 2*4 = 8 seashells
Jim collected 2x + 5 = 2*4 + 5 = 13 seashells
Carrey collected x = 4 seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 3y = 3*3 = 9 seashells.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. Total carrots = 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand for one person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that one bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Since each bottle covers 0.2 units of energy, we need 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 2300 - 4200 = -1900. However, this is not possible since Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This indicates that the initial assumption of 20% coverage per bottle is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 4200 bottles cover 20% of the daily energy demand for 2300 people, then 1 bottle covers 20% of the daily energy demand for 2300 / 4200 = 0.4762 people (approximately).

To find the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand for 2300 people, we can divide 2300 by 0.4762 (the number of people one bottle covers) and multiply by 1 (since we want 100% coverage): 2300 / 0.4762 * 1 = 4835. 

Since Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day, we subtract the current production from the required production: 4835 - 4200 = 635.

The final answer is: 635"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearing babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple with bows) + 1/3 * 8 (all blue-wearing babies with bows) = 2 + 8/3 = 14/3.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (14/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 14) * 100 = 6/14 * 100 = 3/7 * 100 = 42.86%

The final answer is 42.86."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold another 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times a day and goes out three times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2. 

6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree yet.
5. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
6. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
7. Now we have the production amounts for 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10-year-old trees: 50, 150, 350, 800, and 1000 fruits, respectively.
8. The total number of fruits produced by the 5, 6, 7, and 8-year-old trees is 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits.
9. The total number of fruits produced by the 10-year-old tree is 1000 fruits.
10. The total number of fruits produced by the 10-year-old tree during its 10 years of life is 1350 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives us B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B, which gives us R = 4(5) = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so he has:

5 - 3 = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into three equal parts - red, white, and purple. 

Let's denote the amount of paint used for each color as 'x'. Since there are three colors, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x. 

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of paint used for yellow is also 3x. 

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. Since the mural is divided into two halves, the total amount of paint used for all four colors is 12 pints. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 3x = 12 (since the yellow paint is also 3x). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 12. 

Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 2. 

Since x represents the amount of paint used for each color, the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20)
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box for $1:

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Cost per pod
Number of cycles = 120 / $12
Number of cycles = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the amount of chalk used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45 (which is 45% expressed as a decimal). 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the remaining chalk after Monday. 

The amount of chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Now, the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches. 

Let's divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by 20% (0.20) to find the number of days:

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. However, this would leave him with 2.75 - (13 * 0.20) = 0.35 inches of chalk, which is still more than the 2-inch limit. 

So, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 14th day."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's calculate the net rate of building snowballs per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt in the same hour. So, the net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by the net rate (12 snowballs per hour). 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

It will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age when Digimon was released, and then find Jim's current age.

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can represent Jim's age as 'x'. Then, John's age would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 28.

To find Jim's age when Digimon was released, we need to know the year Digimon was released. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the exact release year of Digimon. However, I can provide a general solution.

Let's assume Digimon was released in year 'y'. Then, Jim's age at that time would be x, and John's age would be 2x.

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28 + (y - x), where 'y' is the year Digimon was released.

However, without knowing the release year, we can't find Jim's exact age. But we can express Jim's age in terms of 'x' and 'y'. 

If we knew the release year, we could find Jim's age by subtracting 'x' from it."

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length of her hair decreased by 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost of the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
= $270 + $40
= $310

The final answer is: $310"
"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to multiply the frequency of each task by its respective payment and then add them together.

For emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
For doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
For taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
For cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add the earnings together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

40 gallons (whale's blood) * 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

The total amount of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in later. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days: 
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66:
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish without red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract 22 from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
5/11 * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 colors. 

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used 3 colors.

Now, we subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the house minus the height of the first floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average miles walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles, we can set up an equation to find the total miles walked by all four dogs:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles walked per day * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find the miles walked by the last dog:

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles walked by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles walked by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine first. Since Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Capacity of Ali's class = 120 students
1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 / 8 = 15 students
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

The combined capacity of both schools = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the total amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $275 + $6 = $281

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers changed by both Jordan and his wife.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diapers changed per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan is also changing diapers, we need to subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total to find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day. 

10 (total diapers changed) - 5 (diapers changed by wife) = 5 diapers changed by Jordan per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so the number of red jelly beans is 0.3 * total number of jelly beans.

Let's denote the total number of jelly beans as x. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.3x.

We are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, so we can set up the equation: 0.3x = 900.

Solving for x, we get x = 900 / 0.3 = 3000.

Now, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans: 0.3 * 3000 = 900.

To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated. Since he estimated 30% of the jelly beans are red, the total number of jelly beans he estimated is 900 / 0.3 = 3000.

However, this is the total number of jelly beans, not the number of red jelly beans. To find the number of red jelly beans he estimated, we need to calculate 30% of 3000, which is 0.3 * 3000 = 900.

Since the true number of red jelly beans is 900, Tim's guess was correct.

"To find the total number of people on the bus after the third station, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station, making the total number of people 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of people doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take for all groups to try the escape room. Each group has 45 minutes, and there are 3 groups:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of secret seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric required = 2 * Total width
Total fabric required = 2 * 175
Total fabric required = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of the nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. Since Karen is getting both, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services.

First, calculate the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to first calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from the standard lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the lessons with veterans, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons with veterans, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans to get the total amount he will make for the day. $320 + $120 = $440.

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to calculate 3/4 of the original amount, since she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos.

Let's calculate 3/4 of 20:
3/4 * 20 = (3 * 20) / 4
= 60 / 4
= 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total number of apples.

3/5 * 60 = 36 apples

Walter had 36 apples left. Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

9 * 4 = 36

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, he traveled for 3 days, which is 72 hours. 

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 22"
"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the middle shelf can hold B/2 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold B - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, the sum of the books on all shelves should equal 110:

B + B/2 + (B - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

(3B/2) + (B - 5) = 110

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3B + 2B - 10 = 220

Combine like terms:

5B - 10 = 220

Add 10 to both sides:

5B = 230

Divide both sides by 5:

B = 46

Now that we know the bottom shelf can hold 46 books, we can find the number of books on the middle and top shelves:

Middle shelf: 46/2 = 23 books
Top shelf: 46 - 5 = 41 books

Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, and the total number of books is 110, we can divide 110 by 3 to find the number of bookcases needed:

110 / 3 = 36.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all books fit. Therefore, Elly needs 37 bookcases to hold all her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the total number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77

Now, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test:

Questions needed on the second test = Total questions - Questions answered correctly on the first test
Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42
Questions needed on the second test = 35

Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4
Points scored per game: 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game
Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up one of the marbles and found it to be a bead, so he got rid of it. Therefore, he was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of small candles = 8 / 2 = 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 candles
Number of medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 candles

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. So, the total number of flashlights = 4 flashlights

Total number of lights (candles and flashlights) = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 6 hours to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week:
24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words John can speak in 1 minute. Since his new speed is 375 WPM, he can speak 375 words in 1 minute.

To find out how many minutes it takes him to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can divide the total number of words by his speaking speed to find the time it takes him to speak 10 pages: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop, so 60 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:

1 gallon * 6 lemons/gallon = 6 lemons per gallon

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be:

5 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for this extra gallon. 

Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as the other gallons. 

So, the total amount of lemon juice required for the 5 gallons (4 regular + 1 extra) is:

4 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 24 lemons
+ 1 extra gallon * 12 lemons (twice as tart) = 12 lemons
Total lemons required = 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total."

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."

Since there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8. 

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

There are 43 pink candies in the bag."

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found by all three individuals.

First, let's add up the total number of seashells found:
214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Now, let's subtract the number of cracked seashells:
732 (total seashells) - 67 (cracked seashells) = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To calculate the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

The cost of the dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.
The cost of the bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.
The cost of the salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

The total cost of the place settings is $180.00.

"To find out how much feed Dexter has left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs John will serve and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's calculate her total income:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total income:
$80 (total income) - $20 (total expenses) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making a total of 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making a total of 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

60 - 5 = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out

"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 1 quarter = 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old, and he is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years
- 3 sisters: 16 years each

The total age of the siblings is 12 + 24 + (16 * 3) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 years.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so she spends 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so she spends 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week on yoga.

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week is 30 + 300 = 330 minutes.

There are 4 weeks in the given period. So, the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice is 330 * 4 = 1320 minutes.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"". 

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 

So, Jackie's height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after completing his chores and then subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so he earns a total of 6 * 3 = $18.

He spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 1.25 * 4 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.5 = 2.

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 2 pounds * 10 jars = 20 pounds * $6 per pound = $120.
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 1.5 pounds * 10 jars = 15 pounds * $8 per pound = $120.
The cost of honey for 10 jars is 2 pounds * 10 jars = 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $200.

The total cost of making 10 jars is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This leaves him with:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. This leaves him with:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
   - 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. This leaves him with:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Now, we need to convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to calculate the enrollment at Butler High School first. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Enrollment at Norman High School
Enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Enrollment at Butler High School = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in enrollment = Enrollment at Norman High School - Enrollment at Butler High School

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (the original number of beakers requested minus the number he gathered).

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can express this as 4 = 2x, where x is the distance Aaron ran. 

Since we know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. We can express this as 16 = x / A.

Substituting A = 2V into the equation, we get 16 = x / (2V). 

Now, we can substitute 4 = 2x into the equation to find x. This gives us 16 = 4 / (2V), which simplifies to 16 = 2 / V. 

Multiplying both sides by V, we get 16V = 2. Dividing both sides by 16, we get V = 1/8.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can express this as time = 4 / (1/8). 

Simplifying this, we get time = 4 * 8 = 32 minutes.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son when he was 19, and James is his son. Therefore, John's current age is 18 + 18 = 36 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 36 - 32 = 4 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

The cost of labor is $50 * 3 = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor to get the total cost. 

Total cost = $320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. Then, we subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. Solving for b, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
