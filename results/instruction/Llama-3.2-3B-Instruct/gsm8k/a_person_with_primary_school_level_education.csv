"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the blue and white fibers. 

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fibers: 2 + 1 = 3.

The total number of bolts is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after Josh put in the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs. 

The profit is the new value minus the cost of repairs: $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is 150,000."
"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters

So, James runs 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to the chickens. 

She gave 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 
15 + 25 = 40 cups

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs for 20 chickens. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, we multiply 20 chickens by 3 cups. 
20 * 3 = 60 cups

Now, we subtract the cups of feed she has already given from the total cups needed for 20 chickens. 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining glasses.

There are 16 - 1 = 15 glasses left.

The cost of the remaining glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 60% of the file (200 GB * 0.6 = 120 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the first download is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Then, the system restarts and Carla has to download the remaining 80 GB (200 GB - 120 GB) at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the second download is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Adding the time taken for both downloads, we get 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

The total time taken to download the file is 100 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break it down into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he stops for 2 hours, so he doesn't move.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he drives for 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 3.5 = 280 miles.

Now, we add the distances together: 180 + 15 + 280 = 475 miles.

So, John is 475 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

475"
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so it's 1.2 * $10 = $12. Her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is 460."
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the downloads were three times as many as the first month, so it had 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts cost 3 x $68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes cost 2 x $80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes cost 6 x $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the profit each year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and he sells them for $1.5 each. So, the income from the lemons is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.

The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year. 

The profit each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take to start earning money, we need to divide the cost of the tree by the profit per year. 

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she has two-thirds left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So now, she has two-thirds minus 2 vacuum cleaners left.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold half of the two-thirds minus 2 vacuum cleaners.

Let's represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

We know that after selling at the green house, she has two-thirds of x left. So, two-thirds of x is (2/3)x.

After selling 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold half of (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners. Half of this is ((1/2)((2/3)x - 2).

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - ((1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - ((1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

First, simplify the equation by distributing the 1/2:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

(1/3)x = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine which option is better, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value - Initial price
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"To find the distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances they traveled in the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles in the first day. 

In the second day, they both traveled 150 miles northward. 

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week
$700 per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000 per year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week
$450 per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500 per year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many eggs she eats in one week. 

She makes 3 eggs every morning, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa needs to walk the entire 12-mile trail, we first need to find the time she has already spent walking. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in 1 hour. 

Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time she should spend is the total distance divided by the desired average speed. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

The answer is 6."
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in both drinks after adding them together and then subtract the spilled water.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. It's two-thirds of 10 liters, so it's (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 liters of water.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. It's three-fifths of 15 liters, so it's (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters of water.

Now, let's add the water from both drinks together: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters of water.

We spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters of water.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 46 by 3: 46 ÷ 3 = 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to know how old Raymond is. 

Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from 25. 

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each customer bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to know how many hours it burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters. 

4 * 2 = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the price Kyle paid ($19.50) by 0.75 (1 - 0.25 discount). 

$19.50 / 0.75 = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to add the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes.

First, we multiply the number of each item by its cost:
- Shorts: 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
- Pants: 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
- Shoes: 3 * $42 = $126

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will buy in 60 days. 

Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 60 servings in 60 days. 

There are 15 servings in a carton, so we divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will buy: 60 ÷ 15 = 4.

Since each carton costs $4.00, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton: 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to know the total distance he traveled before the second stop. 

He traveled 20 miles before the first stop. 
Then, he traveled some distance before the second stop. 
The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance before the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

Now, we add the distance before the first stop and the distance before the second stop. 
20 + 45 = 65 miles.

So, Henry traveled 65 miles between his first and second stops.

65"
"To find the price of the boots, we need to first find the price of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $33 = $66.

Together, the two pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

Their total age is 162, so we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

Allen's age 10 years from now will be 99 + 10 = 109."
"To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 80 + 20 = 100.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 100 + 100 = 280.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3: 280 / 3 = 93.33.

The average guess is 93.33."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The answer is: 35"
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver coins and gold coins is 110. 

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to it. 
x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps given. 

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Then, we know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. 
Aaron has 5 more jewels than that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are on sale for 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide $5 by 4 yogurts. $5 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt. 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.

The answer is 75."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to multiply the number of lego sets by the price of each set. 

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so we need to subtract that from the total money he had. 

$195 - $160 (8 video games * $20 per game) = $35

He had $35 left. Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we need to subtract that from the money he had initially. 

$35 - $5 = $30

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he can buy with $30. 

$30 / $15 per set = 2

So, John can buy 2 more lego sets. 

He still has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he runs in a week.

John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. 

First, let's find out how many hours he runs in total. 
He runs 3 hours on the first day. 
He runs half as much on the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on each of those days. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find out his speed. Speed is distance divided by time. 
Speed = Distance / Time 
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours 
Speed = 10 miles per hour.

10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. 

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

Now, we know Dana can run at 4 times the speed of walking. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour, she can run at 4 * 3 = 12 miles per hour.

In 2 hours, Dana can run 12 * 2 = 24 miles.

Dana can walk at 3 miles per hour. In 4 hours, Dana can walk 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

So, in 6 hours, Dana can travel 24 + 12 = 36 miles.

"To find Brandon's iPhone age, we need to follow the given information. 

First, we know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Then, Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
Lastly, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin. 

First, we know Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone, she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

First, we need to find the total number of pieces. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still have left in your daily target. 

You have 2000 calories left and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to divide 200 by 250 to find out how many servings you can have. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply 0.8 by 300 to find out how many grams you can eat. 

0.8 * 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle. Since he makes 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and 20 wicks. The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is:

20 pounds * $10.00/pound = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles, so the total revenue is:

20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $40.00 - $200.00
= -$160.00

So, Charlie's net loss is $160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work from the total number she had initially.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 at work. 

80 - 220 = -140

However, this is not possible since she can't have a negative number of Post-it notes. This means that the information given is incorrect."
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we need to divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so it's 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie. 

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40 = $60

Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

Total amount spent on ties = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. 

First, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4. 

1/4 * 120 = 30 units.

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.

30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. 

He sells 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he sells 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week.

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide 1764 by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per week. 1764 / 12 = 147 dozen eggs per week.

He sells each dozen for $2, so he makes 147 * 2 = $294 per week."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels at 10 mph, we can multiply the time by the speed to get the distance. 

Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find out which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
The total revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens. Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, so Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens. To find the total number of kittens, we need to add the number of kittens from both cats. 7 + 21 + 12 = 40."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Jean ate from the total number of lollipops. 

30 (total lollipops) - 2 (lollipops eaten) = 28

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.

28"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn = $7 + $7 = $14

Now, let's subtract the cost from the total money he has:

$42 - $14 = $28

So, Peter can go to the movies $28 / $7 = 4 times.

28"
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

Subtract the combined weight from the bridge's weight limit:
5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, we need to divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00.

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill. 
$40.00 (original bill) + $13.00 (extra fees) = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total. 
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of clusters and the individual fruit.

There are 6 clusters with 20 fruit each, so 6 x 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual fruit, we get 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so we can calculate that as 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges. 

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 

25 (total oranges) - 7 (not good oranges) = 18 oranges.

The number of good oranges is 18."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the construction. 

The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of construction is $800. 
So, the total cost is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then, Janet pays 10% of $1300 to get it insured. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the cost of the brooch and the insurance. 
$1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is 1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she gets in the first 20 years and the amount she gets in the next 10 years.

In the first 20 years, she gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she gets in the first 20 years is 20 x $50,000 = $1,000,000.

In the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension increases by 5% each year. 

Year 21: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500
Year 22: 5% of $52,500 = $2,625
Year 23: 5% of $55,000 = $2,750
Year 24: 5% of $57,500 = $2,875
Year 25: 5% of $60,000 = $3,000
Year 26: 5% of $62,500 = $3,125
Year 27: 5% of $65,000 = $3,250
Year 28: 5% of $67,500 = $3,375
Year 29: 5% of $70,000 = $3,500
Year 30: 5% of $72,500 = $3,625

The total amount she gets in the next 10 years is $3,500 + $3,625 = $7,125.

So, her annual pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $7,125 = $1,007,125."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

The first half of the year is 6 months. The streaming company charged her $140 per month. So, the amount she paid for the first half of the year is 6 x $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14. So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

Now, we need to add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year. $840 + $126 = $966.

So, Aleena paid a total of $966 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank. We know that she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, and the tank holds 12 gallons. So, the amount of gas left in the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

Now, we can divide the amount of gas left in the tank by the distance she has already traveled to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank. She has traveled 100 miles, so we can divide 8 gallons by 100 miles.

8 ÷ 100 = 0.08 miles per gallon

To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

0.08 miles/gallon × 12 gallons = 0.96 miles

So, Sophia can drive approximately 0.96 miles per gallon."
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

He spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 2 * 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 1 * 3 = 3 hours reading per week.

Now, let's add the hours he spends on TV and reading per week: 6 + 3 = 9 hours per week.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the hours per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, each school has 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40.

Each school has 1 coach, so the total number of coaches is 4.

The total number of people is the sum of players and coaches, which is 40 + 4 = 44.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to know the number of each type of gem. 

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds. 

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so rubies = diamonds - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so emeralds = 2 * rubies = 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems. 
Total gems = diamonds + rubies + emeralds = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we need to know the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 60 = 120

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

The answer is 36."

$129 + $92 = $221

The total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones:
5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Since the interest is 2% per unit, we need to calculate the interest for each unit and then add it to the cost of the cell phone.

Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3
Total interest for 5 units = $3 * 5 = $15

Now, let's add the total cost and the total interest:
$750 (cost) + $15 (interest) = $765

Since Shiela will pay this amount for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3:
$765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The top level has 16 square footage. 
The second level will have half of that, which is 16 / 2 = 8 square footage.
The third level will have half of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4 square footage.
The fourth level will have half of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square footage.

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total by 4 to find the average: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After that, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in a year.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used in the first year by 110 cups to find out how many bags she will use.

910 cups / 110 cups per bag = 8.27 bags.

So, Cecilia will use approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To find the amount of laundry David does, we need to divide Sarah's laundry by 4 since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 

So, David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2. 
Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds."

For the first option, 18 flowers would be 6 packages of 3 flowers. 
6 * $2.50 = $15

For the second option, 18 flowers would be 9 packages of 2 flowers. 
9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is the better price.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the first option.
$15 - $9 = $6

The answer is 6."
"To find the cost of the grooming, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"To find out how many games they won, we need to know how many they lost. 

Let's say they lost x games. Then, they won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games. 

We know they played 22 games in total. So, the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost should be equal to 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. 

Now, we know they won 8 more than they lost, so they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate the amount for the adults and the children separately. 

First, we calculate the amount for the adults. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad. So, the total amount for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Next, we calculate the amount for the children. A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child eats 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amount for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring. 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. 
Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.

"Let's break down the information given:

- James is 10 years old.
- James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's say Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in x seconds. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time would be x + 2 seconds.

We know that Lee's new time is 38 seconds, and his speed improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his old time. We can set up the equation:

0.9x = 38

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.9:

x = 38 / 0.9
x = 42.22

So Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 42.22 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet. Since his speed improved by 10%, we can multiply his old time by 1.1:

Gerald's new time = 1.1 * 42.22
Gerald's new time = 46.54

The final answer is 46.54."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to get the number of cats. 

60 * 2 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180

180 - 12 = 168

So, there are 168 rabbits. 

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 168 (rabbits) + 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 348."
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, 3/5 of the students are girls. 
3/5 of 200 is (3/5) * 200 = 120. 
So, there are 120 girls. 

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
2/3 of 120 is (2/3) * 120 = 80. 
So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. 

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. 
120 - 80 = 40. 

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. 2/3 of 9 is 6. 

So, James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract 6 from 9. 

9 - 6 = 3

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. 

Since she lost half of the tomatoes' volume when she cooked them, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original tomatoes. 

So, we need to multiply 32 by 2 to get the original volume of tomatoes. 

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we need to divide 64 by 16 to find out how many cans of tomatoes she used.

64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply 4 by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 * 3 = 12

The answer is 12."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit from the total number of cars and then subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

There were originally 30 cars. 5 cars took an exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained.

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam. 

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many plants she has in total. 

She has 18 new plants and 2 plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants on the window ledges: 
2 plants per ledge * 40 ledges = 80 plants

Now, let's add the new plants she received: 
80 plants + 18 new plants = 98 plants

Since she is giving 1 plant from each ledge to her friends and family, she will give away 40 plants. 

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants: 
98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed 20 times, the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages. 

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. We know he has 4 more days to complete the reading. 

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week. 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 1 * 5 = 5.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and 1 glass of water on Sunday. 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week. 
5 + 2 = 7.

John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week."
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance the fog bank covers in 10 minutes.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

So, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. 

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

The answer is 140."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has placed and subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, Poppy has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The answer is 500."
"Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats. 

5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time he watched on other days from the total: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he wants to bake 2x cookies.

He actually baked 2x + 15 cookies, but then he dropped 5 cookies. So, the total number of cookies he has now is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We know that the total number of cookies he has now is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we need to subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 100

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

For Beatrice: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups
For Marcell: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups for both Beatrice and Marcell: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how many times Julia rowed 20 feet. 

Since the shore is 64 feet away, we divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2. Since Julia can't row a fraction of a time, we round down to 3 times. 

So, Julia rowed 3 times 20 feet, which is 60 feet. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we divide 60 by 10 to get 6. 

So, the boat took on 6 times 2 liters, which is 12 liters of water."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons each teacher has per day and then multiply that by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Ryan has 25 flowers."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many birds are in the photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Sasha bought 10 of them for $10 each, so the total cost is 10 x $10 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. Sasha bought 5 of them for $16 each, so the total cost is 5 x $16 = $80.

The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Sasha sells them at a 50% increase in price, so the selling price is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15. Since she has 10 of them, the total selling price is 10 x $15 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. Sasha sells them at a 50% increase in price, so the selling price is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24. Since she has 5 of them, the total selling price is 5 x $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost. So, the profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by the value of one part (6) to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

7 * 6 = 42

The answer is 42."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to subtract the number of containers already at the port from the total number of vehicles on the second day.

First, let's find the total number of vehicles in the containers already at the port:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

Now, let's subtract the number of vehicles in the containers already at the port from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles by 5 to find the number of containers:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To find Adrien's salary four years later, we need to calculate his salary four years ago first. 

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his salary four years ago as follows:

$40,000 * 1.3 = $52,000

Now, we know that Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago. 

$52,000 * 1.4 = $73,200

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago as follows:

$52,000 / 1.3 = $40,000

Now, we know that Lylah's salary four years later is 40% more than what she was making four years ago. 

$40,000 * 1.4 = $56,000

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. 

Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. 

So, 20 letters were stamped. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current number of letters in the pile. 

30 (current letters) - 20 (stamped letters) = 10

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she has x + 5 - 3 spoons left. 

We know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 = 12.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from patients and doctors.

Total time spent on patients = 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from patients is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The doctors charge $150 an hour, and there are 200 hours of doctor time:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors:
$40,000 + $30,000 = $70,000

The total cost is the time spent on patients (since we don't have information about other costs):
$30,000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

2 cookies cost 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Adding these together, we get $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total, we get $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip. So the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we need to multiply the number of questions by the time he spent on it. 

75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed

Since Mark completed 600 questions in the first test, we need to find out how many questions he completed in the second test.

75 questions * 6 hours = 450 questions completed

Now, we need to find out how many questions Mark left incomplete in the first test. 

600 - 450 = 150 questions left incomplete

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

First, we multiply 12 (the number of blue gumballs) by 4:
12 * 4 = 48

Then, we add 22 to the result:
48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The answer is 20."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to know the number of queens first. Let's say the number of queens is x. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2x. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, babies, and queens is 700. 

The equation is: 4x + 2x + x = 700

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (x = 100), we can find the number of worker bees: 4x = 4 * 100 = 400

The answer is 400."
"If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, that's 2 hours * 7 days = 14 hours in a week. If he earns $10 an hour, then he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140 in a week."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items and then add the tax.

First, let's add up the cost of the food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add up the cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we need to add the 10% tax on the non-food items. 
10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. 
So, the total cost of non-food items with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, let's add the total cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so 8 clients will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach. 
16 bottles of bleach will cost 16 * $2 = $32.

Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so 8 clients will need 8 * 1 = 8 packs of cloths. 
8 packs of cloths will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses will be $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Total income is $92. 
Profit will be $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by 3, since he can harvest every 3 months.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

4000"
"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, there are 30 bees that left initially + 15 bees that returned = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as the initial 30 bees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees are left in the hive before the last 6 hours. We already know that 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. So, the total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

Now, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive. So, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The answer is 75."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, so the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to know how many friends Dorothy has. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. 

Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has. 

4 * 4 = 16

James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To find out who wins, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

Steve's time: Distance = 3 miles, Speed = 440 feet per minute. 
First, we need to convert miles to feet. 1 mile = 5280 feet. 
So, 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. 
Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's time: Distance = 2 miles, Speed = 264 feet per minute. 
Time = Distance / Speed = 2 * 5280 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve's time (36 minutes) is less than Tim's time (40 minutes), Steve wins. 

The winner, Steve, will be waiting for the loser, Tim, for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes."
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Carl paid, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack, then multiply that by the cost of each cookie.

First, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Then, we multiply the number of cookies by the cost of each cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Now, we subtract the amount Carl paid from the $10 bill: 
$10 - $6 = $4

Carl receives $4 as change."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Dave ate 14 fries. 
A seagull ate half of that, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 
Now, Dave and the seagull ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries in total. 
Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. 
Now, Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons ate 21 + 9 = 30 fries in total. 
A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate 2/3 * (30 - 30) = 0 fries. 
This means the raccoon didn't eat any fries. 
Now, 30 - 0 = 30 fries are left. 
Finally, ants ate 1 fry, so 30 - 1 = 29 fries are left. 

Since 5 fries were left, the pack must have had 5 + 1 = 6 fries when Dave bought it.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each. So, that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each. So, that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we add the hours for both types of days: 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by 16: 17 hours * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet. 
1 foot = 12 inches
So, 
- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- 300 rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- 120 croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- 60 baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together: 
100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas needed by all the apes. 

The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 2.

Monkeys: 200 * 2 = 400
Gorillas: 400 * 2 = 800
Baboons: 100 * 2 = 200

Now, let's add them up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate how far each person ran. 

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, Blake ran 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she ran to the 40-yard line and back, she ran 40 + 40 = 80 yards each time. So, she ran 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.

Since 2720 is greater than 1500, Kelly is the winner. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract 1500 from 2720. 2720 - 1500 = 1220.

The winner ran 1220 yards farther than the loser."

"To find the cost after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months.

First, let's calculate the price increase after 2 months:
20% of $20 = 0.20 * 20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Then, let's calculate the price increase after 4 months:
20% of $24 = 0.20 * 24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see that the price increase is doubling every 2 months. So, we can calculate the price after 6 months:
20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * 28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 12 months:
20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * 34.56 = $6.912
New price after 12 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 18 months:
20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * 41.472 = $8.2944
New price after 18 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 24 months:
20% of $49.7664 = 0.20 * 49.7664 = $9.95328
New price after 24 months = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 30 months:
20% of $59.71968 = 0.20 * 59.71968 = $11.943936
New price after 30 months = $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616

We can continue this pattern to find the price after 36 months:
20% of $71.663616 = 0.20 * 71.663616 = $14.3327232
New price after 36 months = $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392

Now, we have the costs of all the toys: 
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of work at $35/hour, so she'll lose 3 x $35 = $105.

Now, let's calculate the money she'll have if she hires the accountant. She'll pay $90 for the accountant's services.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

She needs 15 flans, and each flan requires 3 eggs. So, she needs 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.

She gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many jobs she needs, we divide 45 by 9.

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times."
"Let's say Brooke's current age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2 + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

So Brooke's current age is 8. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2.

Average = (hat + jacket) / 2
Average = ($25 + $75) / 2
Average = $100 / 2
Average = $50

So, the pants cost $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform.

Total cost = hat + jacket + pants
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

4. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Two (19), Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirtytwo (8).

If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to find 50% of $1000. 
50% of $1000 is $500. 

So, she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12. 
$1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and the time for cutting separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling all the potatoes. Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, and there are 60 potatoes, we multiply 1.5 minutes by 60 potatoes.

1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time for cutting all the potatoes. It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, and there are 60 potatoes. We multiply 5 seconds by 60 potatoes.

5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the cutting time to minutes by dividing by 60.

300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time together.

90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate how much they made from selling lemonade. 

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50. So, they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon. 

They made $25 in profit, and since profit is the money they made minus the cost, we can set up an equation: 

$10 (from selling lemonade) - cost of lemons - cost of sugar = $25

We know the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, and they make 20 glasses per gallon. So, the cost of sugar per glass is $2 / 20 = $0.10. 

The total cost of sugar for 20 glasses is 20 x $0.10 = $2. 

Now we can rewrite the equation: 

$10 - $2 (sugar) - cost of lemons = $25

$10 - $2 = $8. 

$8 - cost of lemons = $25

Cost of lemons = $25 - $8
Cost of lemons = $17

The answer is 17."

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after giving to his family is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. 
The total number of crabs the three have together is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage.

For the first week, he worked 5 hours and earned 5 x $10 = $50.

For the second week, he worked 8 hours and earned 8 x $10 = $80.

To find the total amount he earned, we add the earnings from both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is 130."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

The winner got 3/4 of the votes, so we need to find 1/4 of the total votes to find the loser's votes.

1/4 of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20.

So, the loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's say the number of white carnations is x. Then, 5x = 200. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 40. 

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160. 

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. 
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark is 20 + 2 = 22 years old now.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

"To find out how long it will take the less well-rounded team to complete the race, we need to calculate the time for each runner. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. 
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. 
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for all four runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two events. 

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom got 20 apples, Jenna got 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 
20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

30"
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw. 

So, the total number of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we know that 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents. Since the hamsters and rabbits used 70 pieces, the remaining straw must be used for the rats. 

So, the number of straw used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. 

To find out the number of rats, we divide the total number of straw used for the rats by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, we divide 15 by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage. 

15 / 3 = 5.

The answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

First, we find the interest for 1 month: 
$100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since the interest is for 3 months, we multiply the interest for 1 month by 3: 
$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the original amount: 
$100 + $6 = $106

So, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict.

106"
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of buying the bags is $20 per bag, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. Let's say the trader bought x bags. The total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is 30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 50

So, the trader bought 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

$20.25 (tickets) - $4.50 (difference) = $15.75 (food)

Now, we need to add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $33 (ride 1) + $33 (ride 2) = $88.00

Since they are splitting the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

$88.00 ÷ 3 = $29.33

So, each of them paid $29.33."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute.
He collects for 3 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects: 
2 peaches/minute x 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

The answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7. 

First, we need to convert 3.5 pounds to a decimal by dividing by 10. 3.5 ÷ 10 = 0.35 pounds per day for one duck. 

Now, we multiply 0.35 by 10 to find out how much one duck needs per day. 0.35 * 10 = 3.5 pounds per day for one duck.

Since there are 10 ducks, we multiply 3.5 by 10. 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds per day for 10 ducks.

The answer is 35."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, he has 10 - 2 = 8 more trees each year. 

After 10 years, he has 50 + (10 * 10) - (2 * 10) = 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Then, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39. So, 39 trees die.

Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The answer is 24."
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. 

She needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2. 
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Violetta has $20. 
Change = Amount Violetta has - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10

We have 200 pounds of carrots and each restaurant gets 2 pounds. There are 40 restaurants.

First, let's find out how many pounds of carrots will be given to the restaurants:
40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."

23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in Soda."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 20 + 60 = 80. Twice that is 2 * 80 = 160 cards. So now she has 120 + 160 = 280 cards.

The answer is 280."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to know how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so it pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. To find the total number of pails, we need to add these two numbers together. 

5 (morning pails) + 6 (afternoon pails) = 11 pails

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters in each pail.

11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"To find out how much money John made that year, we need to calculate his total salary for the year and add the award money.

First, let's calculate his total salary for the year. He makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's add the award money. The award is $5000.

Total money = Total salary + Award money
Total money = $104,000 + $5000
Total money = $105,500

So, John made $105,500 that year."
"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons of grapes each acre produces, and then multiply that by the number of barrels each ton makes.

First, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons per acre: 10 * 5 = 50 tons of grapes per year.

"Carl ate 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he ate a sandwich every day for 7 days. So, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. He ate 3 omelets, so he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

He used 8 slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese.

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese."

"To find the average of the six tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by 6. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score. The lowest score is 71. 

Now, let's subtract 71 from the total score: 
358 - 71 = 287

We want the average to be 93, so we multiply 93 by 6: 
93 * 6 = 558

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. 
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode.
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860."
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   So, the cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how much Sara needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's say she mows the lawn x times. Then, she earns $4x. She earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. 

So, the total amount she earns is $4x + $20. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get at least $70. 

We can set up the equation: $4x + $20 = $70. 

Subtracting $20 from both sides, we get $4x = $50. 

Dividing both sides by $4, we get x = 12.5. 

Since Sara can't mow the lawn half a time, she needs to mow the lawn 13 times.

The final answer is 13."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'. 

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5(r + 2). 

We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so we can set up the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around it. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). 

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. 

Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5) 
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the perimeter by his speed to find out how many hours he spends walking. 

Hours spent walking = Perimeter / Speed 
Hours spent walking = 15 / 3 
Hours spent walking = 5 

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the first day, we need to subtract the number of customers on the third day from the total number of customers on the third day. 

The total number of customers on the third day is 500. 
The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day. 
Let's say the number of customers on the first day is x. 
Then, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50. 
The total number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first and second days, which is x + (x + 50). 
We know that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. 
So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 50) = 500. 
Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500. 
Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450. 
Divide both sides by 2: x = 225. 
So, the number of customers on the first day is 225. 
The number of customers on the second day is 225 + 50 = 275. 
The number of customers on the third day is 500."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The big pool also lost 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. We know the big pool lost 16 gallons, so it has 4x - 16 gallons now.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4x - 16 = 4x.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total amount she needs ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00) to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to first calculate the total amount she needs to pay back. 

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 x 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay back. 
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses. 
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

There are 15 flowers in the vase."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to know Harriet's age. Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores. 
68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points of all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total points. 
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The answer is 54."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

He initially had 40 water type cards, then lost 8, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
Then, he bought 14 grass type cards, but this doesn't change the number of water type cards.

Now, James has 32 water type cards and a total of 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

Avocado is $1.00. 
Two sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. 
The upgrade is $3.00. 

Now, let's add all these amounts together: 
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides: x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums. 

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

Since the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can divide the difference by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium. 

28 / 2 = 14 fish.

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium."
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours she worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate.

She works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week. So, the total hours she worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours she worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

Her hourly rate is $250, so the total amount she earned is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

So, the amount she paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up all the costs and divide by 3.

The total cost is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

Now, we divide the total cost by 3: $96 ÷ 3 = $32.

So, each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 
4 bags * 50 pounds = 200 pounds

Then, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 
200 pounds * $1.50 = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 
4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add the total number of cookies each of them ate. 
Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to multiply the number of cookies each of them ate by 200 calories. 
Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, let's subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed. 
9200 - 3600 = 5600

The answer is 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to know the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can find the total number of girls by multiplying the number of classes by 0.5 (which is 50% in decimal form). 

Total number of girls = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5

Since we can't have half a girl, we can assume that the total number of girls is 1.5 * 2 = 3 (rounding up to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a person).

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school. 

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - Total number of girls in the first two classes
= 3 - 27
= -24

Since we can't have a negative number of girls, this means that the information given is inconsistent. However, if we assume that the total number of girls in the school is 3, then we can find the number of boys in the third class.

Number of boys in the school = Total number of students - Total number of girls
= 3 * 2 - 3
= 3

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - Number of boys in the first two classes

"To find out how many apps Travis has now, we need to subtract the apps he deleted from the apps he had initially and then add the new apps he downloaded.

Travis initially had 61 apps.
He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61: 61 - 9 = 52.
Then, he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52: 52 + 18 = 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 x 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night, 15 cougars the previous night, 12 cougars today, and 36 wolves today. So, the total number of animals he killed is 10 + 15 + 12 + 36 = 73.

So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
4 * 21 = 84. 

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of money and add them together.

Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 100 pennies are worth 100 cents. 
40 nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents.
20 dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents.
40 dollar bills are worth 100 dollars each, so 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * 100 = 4000 dollars.

Now, let's add the values together: 
100 cents + 200 cents + 200 cents + 4000 dollars = 
100 + 200 + 200 = 500 cents. 
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we can convert 500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 
500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Brady has 5 dollars in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to find the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood that termites ate, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate from the total weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

"Let's break down the information given:

- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. 
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52. 
52 - 8 = 44 apples for Jamal.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas together: 
52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) = 124 fruits.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making. 

She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs.

66 cookies / 12 cookies per cup = 5.5 cups

So, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. 
Ferdinand has 3 trees, so twice that is 3 * 2 = 6. 
Adding 5 to that makes 6 + 5 = 11 trees for Harry.

Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3 trees. 
So, 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price and the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price is $350,000.
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. The difference between the total price of the house and her budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the selling price: 
Total amount paid = $400,000 + $12,000 + $20,000 = $432,000

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find the net proceeds: 
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $432,000 = -$32,000

Since Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount, we need to subtract this from the net proceeds. 
Net proceeds = -$32,000 - $250,000 = -$282,000

The net proceeds from selling the house is -$282,000."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 
20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Now, we know it takes 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. 
28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken. 
28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 51 minutes."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then add them together.

Cost of newspaper ads: 
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Total cost of newspaper ads = 50 * 5 = $250

Cost of television ads:
Number of television ads = 15
Cost per television ad = $75
Total cost of television ads = 15 * 75 = $1125

Total amount spent = Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads
Total amount spent = $250 + $1125
Total amount spent = $1375

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find the number of golf balls: 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.

Now, we know half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

The answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to add the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows in each bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. 
2 houses * 4 windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows. 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the prices of the items together. 

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00. 

The amount the mother paid is $20. 

$20 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives the mother $5.00 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. The total number of stitches is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide 630 by 2. 630 / 2 = 315.

The answer is 315."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Sean's lines in the first scene are a third of the total lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find out how many cards had the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them: 2/5 of 80 cards = 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards.
2. Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.
3. Then, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter B: 1/2 of 48 cards = 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards.
4. Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.
5. Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter C: 5/8 of 24 cards = 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.
6. Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

So, 9 cards had the letter D on them.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is 4."
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. We know that the sum of their current ages is 20. 

Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is M + 1 (since the sum of their ages is 20). 

M + (M + 1) = 20
2M + 1 = 20
2M = 19
M = 9.5

So, Mico is 9.5 years old and Marco is 10.5 years old.

In 10 years, Mico will be 9.5 + 10 = 19.5 years old and Marco will be 10.5 + 10 = 20.5 years old.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 19.5 + 20.5 = 40.

40"
"Let's say Sam's current age is x. 
Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6x + 9 and Sam's age will be x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Expanding the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtracting 3x from both sides: 
3x + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides: 
3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3: 
x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid.
$5 + $2 = $7.

The total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. So, the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800, and the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we need to calculate the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 guests. In total, there are 15 + 30 = 45 people. 

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy needs 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas. 

Now, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza. 15 pizzas * $15 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out how much space is taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

There are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long. So, the total space taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Since the necklace is 25 inches long, the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4. 

17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we need to add the number of stories each of them wrote. 

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to add the number of stories they wrote in the second week to the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has. 

She has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money she has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we need to subtract 55 cents from 145 cents: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 stars. 
Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 
Since the total number of stars is 76, we subtract the stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 
Now, we divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows: 40 / 5 = 8. 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry. 

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 6000 / 2000 = 3.

So, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out. 

Let's call the total number of medals given out 'x'. We can set up the equation: 39 = x/10.

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: x = 39 * 10 = 390.

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars. 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide 16 by 8. 16 / 8 = 2.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. 

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

So, she earns 15 x $5 = $75."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add up the points:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, so he does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. 
He does ten fewer squats than the first day, so he does 50 - 10 = 40 squats. 
He doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so he does 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 100 + 120 + 40 + 40 = 300."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 people in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 / 14 = 3

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The fourth person bids $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $400. 

Since she wins after the fourth person, she paid $400. 

The final answer is: $400"
"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven and the total cost of the miles driven.

First, we need to find out how many miles John drives in a week. He drives to work and back, so that's 2 trips per day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 trips per week. Since he drives 30 miles each way, he drives 30 x 2 = 60 miles per week.

Since he drives 60 miles per week for 50 weeks, he drives a total of 60 x 50 = 3000 miles per year.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the miles driven. He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost of the miles driven is 3000 x $2 = $6000.

John also gets a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he gets a total of 12 x $150 = $1800 bonus per year.

So, the total cost of driving per year is $6000 + $1800 = $7800.

The final answer is: $7800"

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year. 

Now, we know that she has 250 - 45 - 50 = 155 books left. Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 90 + 45 = 135 books in the first two years. 

So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 135 - 90 = 45. 

Since each book sells at 20$, she earned 45 * 20 = 900$ in the second year."

Watson works 5 days a week and earns $10 per hour. He works 10 hours a day, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week. 

Since there are 4 weeks in April, he works 50 * 4 = 200 hours in April. 

His regular earnings are 200 * $10 = $2000. 

He also gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. 

So, his total earnings in April are $2000 + $300 = $2300."

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses in one week, we divide 8 by 4. 

8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 2 * 4 = 8 pounds.

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate how much he has left after buying the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family, which is 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, let's add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7: 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The family consumes 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to know Jane's age first. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can calculate Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. This means Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

2. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

3. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people came to Martha's party, we need to first find out how many people were invited. 

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That means 24 - 8 = 16 people still came.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 16 - 2 = 14 people came to Martha's party.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to find the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8). 20 + 8 = 28. 

The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 50 + 28 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by 2. 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (like the pool) is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 x $0.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children. 
Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

123"
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of electric poles, we divide 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To find out how many people left, we need to find the total number of people first. 
Total people = men + women = 25 + 15 = 40

Since 1/4 of the people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 
1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10

So, 10 people left. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed. Since 10 people left, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

We know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Now, we need to find the number of women left. 
Number of women left = initial number of women - number of women who left 
= 15 - 7 
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know the book costs $4. 
Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. 
So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

Now, we add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26 + 46 = 72 

Now we need to find out how many boxes Jam has. We know that 3x + 2 = 26. 

3x = 26 - 2 
3x = 24 
x = 8 

Now we know that each box has 8 pencils. 

So, Jam has 3 * 8 = 24 pencils in the boxes and 2 loose pencils. 

In total, Jam has 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. 

Now, we know that Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total. 

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8 to find out how many boxes they need: 
72 / 8 = 9 

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes: 65 / 13 = 5.

Now, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12: 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the added cream. Since the added cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker, we just need to add 15 to the previous result: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many old records the 5 people brought in. 

Since they leave with 7 new records, and they get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring in, we can say that for every 3 records they bring in, they get 2 new ones. 

So, the 5 people brought in 5 * 3 = 15 records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since there are 100 employees, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

First, we need to find out how many people were on the bus after the second stop. We know that 7 people got off and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

Now, we know that 5 people got on at the first stop. So, the number of people who got on at the terminal is 21 - 5 = 16.

The answer is 16."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. 

Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. 

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. 

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. 

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage-points.

40 percentage-points / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 120 minutes to hours.

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

The phone will take 2 hours to fully charge."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to do some simple math. 

First, Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So, we need to subtract 3 from 17. 17 - 3 = 14.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they got and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20. So, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they got were $1 off, but the coupon took $2 off. This means the customer got $1 - $2 = -$1 off.

Now, we add the rewards they got and the coupon discount. $4 (rewards) - $1 (coupon discount) = $3.

The customer spent $43, and they got $3 off. So, the amount they paid is $43 - $3 = $40.

The customer paid $40 on this shopping trip."
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total pay first. 

Total pay for Job A = $15 * 2000 hours = $30,000

Since the state has a 20% total tax rate, we need to calculate the tax amount. 

Tax amount for Job A = $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Net pay for Job A = Total pay - Tax amount = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the net pay for Job B. 

First, we need to calculate the net income after property tax. 

Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Since the state has a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, we need to calculate the tax amount. 

Tax amount for Job B = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Net pay for Job B = Net income after property tax - Tax amount = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay.

Difference in net pay = Net pay for Job B - Net pay for Job A = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The answer is: 8400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to first find the number of ruined castles. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins. 
40% is the same as 40/100. 
So, 40/100 * 220 = 88 castles are ruins.

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. 
Half of 88 is 88/2 = 44.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100."
"To find out how many guns they would have if they shared them equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by 4.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then the price after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is 8 + (8 * 0.5) = 12 dollars per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the first year is 8 * 12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is 12 - (12 * 0.25) = 9 dollars per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the second year is 8 * 9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to know how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 x 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, we need to divide the total number of students by 3 and then subtract 10.

Let's say the number of students in the smallest group is x. 
Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:
3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of chickens and cows. 

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write an equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20.

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Total number of legs = (20 cows * 4 legs) + (40 chickens * 2 legs) = 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is 160."

So, Josh is left with 6 - 1 = 5 balls."
"To find the weight of the blue beetle, we know the pink frog weighs the same as it. So, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container. 
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds."

Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day after taking his coach's advice. 

He originally runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, so we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, he now runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day. 

Since June has 30 days, we multiply 6000 by 30 to find the total distance covered in June. 

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters."

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shirts before the discount. 

The cost of 2 shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 

Then, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 40% of $60. 

40% of $60 is 0.4 x $60 = $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 

$60 - $24 = $36. 

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find the difference in the amount of money they make per day, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of money they make from tractors and silos.

They used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made 10 x $100 = $1000 per day from tractors.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day from silos.

The difference in the amount of money they make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) x 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per month, we need to add the cost of food, treats, and medicine. 

First, we need to find the weekly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is 4 * $25 = $100. 

Now, we add the monthly cost of treats ($20) and medicine ($100) to the monthly cost of food ($100). 
$100 + $20 + $100 = $220

So, Madeline spends $220 per month on her dog.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find out how much time he spent on other activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, we know that he spent 30% of his time watching shows and sightseeing. Let's call the total time he spent on these activities 'x'. We know that 30% of 'x' is 6 hours, so we can set up the equation:

0.3x = 6

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.3:

x = 6 / 0.3
x = 20

So, John spent 20 hours on shows and sightseeing. 

Since we know that 40% of his total time was spent sightseeing, we can find the total time he spent by dividing 20 by 0.4:

20 / 0.4 = 50

So, John spent 50 hours sightseeing.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. So, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet, and the second tree is 11 feet. So, the combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees. So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears first. 

6 toy cars cost 6 x $2 = $12. 
5 teddy bears cost 5 x $1 = $5. 
The total cost is $12 + $5 = $17. 

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, he has $28 - $17 = $11. 

Then, his mother gives him an extra $10. So, he now has $11 + $10 = $21. 

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after buying the things she wants.

First, let's add up the costs of the things she wants:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Arcade tokens cost $5.
- Two go-kart rides cost 2 x $10 = $20.

Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will play mini-golf, ride the go-karts, and get arcade tokens, the cost per friend is $5 + $10 + $5 = $20.

Now, let's divide the remaining money by the cost per friend:
$60 ÷ $20 = 3

So, Morgan can invite 3 friends to her party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so she spends 4 x 25 cents = 1 dollar. 

She saves the change, which is $5 - $1 = $4. 

If she saves for 5 days, she will save 4 x $4 = $20."
"To find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs, we need to know how much he spent on candy first. 

Since Billy took half of his change, and he spent it on gumballs, that means he spent the other half on candy. 

He had $10 initially. If he spent half of it on gumballs, that means he spent $5 on gumballs. 

Now, we know he bought 40 gumballs for $5. To find out the cost of one gumball, we divide $5 by 40. 

$5 / 40 = $0.125 per gumball. 

Since Billy spent $0.125 on one gumball, he must have spent $5 / $0.125 = 40 dollars on gumballs. 

Now, we know he spent $40 on gumballs and $5 on candy. So, he had $10 - $5 = $5 left. 

Since he took half of his change, that means he had $5 / 2 = $2.5 left. 

He spent $2.5 on candy. 

Now, we know the cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide $2.5 by $1.5. 

$2.5 / $1.5 = 1.67 pounds."
"Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write an equation: 
2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
2x = 50

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount for each type of bed.

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
A bed for a collie takes the average of the two, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing."
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house and the distance back home. 

Distance to his friend's house = 200 miles
Distance back home = 240 miles
Total distance = 200 + 240 = 440 miles

Now, we need to find the time taken for each part of the trip. 

Time taken to reach his friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to reach his friend's house = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken to return home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to return home = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to return home
Total time taken = 2.86 + 3 = 5.86 hours

The trip took 5.86 hours."
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know that there are 96 students in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Now, we know that 5 girls were absent. To find the number of boys who were present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys. 

Number of boys = 53
Number of absent boys = 4
Number of boys present = 53 - 4 = 49

So, there were 49 boys at Small Tree School on Friday."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2. 

6 girls / 2 = 3 boys

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park. 

6 girls + 3 boys = 9 kids

"To find the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we need to subtract the points she already has from the total required points. 

She has 15 points from the first test and 18 points from the second test. 

15 + 18 = 33 points

She needs at least 42 points in total. 

42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane needs at least 9 points on her third test to pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3. 

Since a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:
4 * 3 - 5 = 7

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 7 = 21.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can set up an equation to represent this:
3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50

Now, let's solve for x:
3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
31 + x = 50
x = 50 - 31
x = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

19"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to know how many points Sara had. We know Sara scored 8 points. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we multiply Sara's points by 3. 
3 * 8 = 24

So Erin has 24 points now. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract 14 from 24. 
24 - 14 = 10

The answer is 10."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each frame costs $20. The logo etching adds 20% to the cost, so the total cost per frame is $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24.

The total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer needs a cord that costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

1198"
"To find the cost of the materials, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The cost of the materials is $80. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the original price minus the cost of the materials. 

$400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 
On Saturday, they sold double that number, so they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs. 
On Sunday, they sold half of that amount, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. 

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total. 
The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50 pairs."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice, we need to add the hours she practiced on each day.

She practiced 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she practiced twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add the hours from each day: 3 + 4 = 7 hours.

The total hours Hallie had dance practice is 7 hours a week."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the equipment is faulty. 

First, we need to find 40% of $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means 40,000 pieces of equipment are faulty. 

Now, we subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces to find the number of functioning pieces. 
Total number of pieces = $400,000 / $400 = 1,000 pieces
Number of functioning pieces = 1,000 - 40 = 960 pieces

Now, we multiply the number of functioning pieces by the cost of each piece to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces.
Cost of each piece = $400,000 / 1,000 = $400
Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 960 * $400 = $384,000

The final answer is: $384,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the total amount of milk from both halves.

She has 30 sheep. Half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each day, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, Mary collects 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to find out how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

She started with 12 rolls and fed 6 to her children. So, 12 - 6 = 6 rolls were left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we need to divide the money she got ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 12 x 2 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to add the apples picked on each day: 
14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first find out how many socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, in total, Lindsay washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks. 

There were 50 socks that needed washing. 

To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. 

50 - 35 = 15 

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."

First, let's add the cookies: 
23 (Rachel's cookies) + 42 (Janet's cookies) = 65 cookies

Then, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate: 
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to divide the total amount borrowed by the number of months.

Total amount borrowed = $3,650
Interest rate = 10% per year
Number of months = 5 months

First, we need to convert the interest rate to a monthly rate. 
Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 = 0.008333 (as a decimal)

Now, we can calculate the monthly payment using the formula:
Monthly payment = Total amount / (1 + (Monthly interest rate * Number of months))

Monthly payment = 3650 / (1 + (0.008333 * 5))
Monthly payment = 3650 / (1 + 0.041665)
Monthly payment = 3650 / 1.041665
Monthly payment = 3500

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $3500."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. 

112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

The answer is 67."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 x 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

She spends $18 on supplies, so her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to find the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it.

Let's say the total amount of land he had is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of it, that means he sold 3/5 * x hectares.

The amount of land he has left is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * x hectares.

We know that the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. So, we can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * 5/2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52. 
50% of 52 is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 
So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. 
The total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 29. 
Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, 14 people can't make it, and 29 - 14 = 15 people perform.

The answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 
Netflix costs $10 a month. 
Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling them. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discount is $2. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8. 
The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60. 
To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42.

So, Tim saves $42 by cancelling his cable subscription."
"To find the total work time, we need to add the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

First, we need to convert the time spent recording into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can add the time spent on each task: 
4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

The answer is 21.43."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total number of spaces in the shelving system. 

There are 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is 6 * 6 = 36.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. 

20 more than 72 is 72 + 20 = 92.

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first find out how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. 

1/3 is equal to 4/12 and 1/4 is equal to 3/12. 

So, Jenny gave away 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12 of the pizza. 

Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can find out how many slices she gave away by multiplying 7/12 by 12. 

7/12 * 12 = 7 slices. 

Jenny gave away 7 slices. She had 12 - 7 = 5 slices left. 

Then, Jenny eats 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left. 

The answer is 3."

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, the number of millipedes is 1/3 * 90 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs. 
90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168.

The total number of bugs is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to know the age of Alice first. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

He works 4 weeks in a month, and each week has 6 days. So, the total number of days he works in a month is 4 x 6 = 24 days.

Now, we multiply the total number of days he works in a month by his daily wage: 24 days x $50/day = $1200.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly earnings by 12: $1200 x 12 = $14400.

The builder earns $14400 in a year."
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour in each batch. 

Since Mark is making 4 batches, and each batch needs 3 cups of flour, he needs 4 x 3 = 12 cups of flour. 

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we do the same thing. Since Mark is making 4 batches, and each batch needs 1 cup of milk, he needs 4 x 1 = 4 cups of milk. 

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 

6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk) = 4

The answer is 4."
"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day. 
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours)

If Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, the energy used per day will be:
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

The energy saved per day = 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

In 30 days, the energy saved = 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

The final answer is 135."
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's add up the stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
- A zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add them up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To find out how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we need to divide the total number of people (20) by the number of people each sandwich serves (4). 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 2 pounds of meat will cost:
2 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $14.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 2 pounds of cheese will cost:
2 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $6.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$14.00 + $6.00 = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. He bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

He bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. Now, he has 0 + 0 = 0 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 0 + 100 = 100."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he already took from his total goal. 

Elliott's total goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps before his jog.

Now, we need to subtract the steps he took before his jog from his total goal. 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog. So, he took 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 x 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. So, 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The company paid each of these 30 employees $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, she paid for 2 pounds, but got 1 pound for free. The cost of the taffy is 2 pounds * $3/pound = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $6 + $2.50 = $8.50.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $8.50 = $1.50 left.

1.50"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is twice that much, so it costs 2 x $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Tim gets a 20% discount on these two packages. 20% of $1200 is 0.2 x $1200 = $240. 

So, the cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

She eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she eats 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since 1 dozen is 12 cookies, we need to divide 60 cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs. 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05. 

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the probability of a candle exploding, we can't directly find the intersection. However, we can assume that the probability of a candle exploding is independent of its smell. Therefore, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities.

Let's assume the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05 and the probability of a candle exploding is x. Then, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05x.

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, we can express the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as 0.05x.

To find a numerical answer, we would need more information about the probability of a candle exploding."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total regular price is 4 x $20 = $80.

The discount is 30% of the total regular price. 30% of $80 is 0.3 x $80 = $24.

So, the total discount is $24. 

The total cost of the discounted blouses is the total regular price minus the total discount. 
$80 - $24 = $56.

The final answer is 56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by the sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To find the number of dromedaries, we need to subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads. 

Since camels have 2 humps, the number of camels can be found by dividing the total number of bumps by 2. 

Number of camels = Total bumps / 2
Number of camels = 304 / 2
Number of camels = 152

Now, subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads to find the number of dromedaries.

Number of dromedaries = Total heads - Number of camels
Number of dromedaries = 180 - 152
Number of dromedaries = 28

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, he traveled 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Then, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, in the next two days, he traveled 240 kilometers.

He also traveled 0 kilometers on the next day.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, he traveled 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

3140"
"To find Timothy's locker size, we need to know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is 40."

He initially had $5000.
The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 x $4000 = $8000.
Now, let's add the money he got from the two banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $14000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $14000 in capital.

"To find out how many cats were left, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and took 5 cats each. So, 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. Now, we have 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5. 
   3/5 * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18
4. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. Now, we subtract 18 from 30.
   30 - 18 = 12

There are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 18 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 * $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 * $12 = $96.
The last 18 months cost 18 * $14 = $252.

Now, we add the costs of all three parts: $48 + $96 + $252 = $396.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

First, we know that the total savings from both jeans is $6. We also know that Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. 

Let's say the original price of the jogger jeans is x. Then, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * x. 

The total savings is the sum of the savings from both jeans, which is $6. So, we can set up the equation: 

1/3 * x + (x - 6) = 6 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 

x + 3x - 18 = 18 

Combine like terms: 

4x - 18 = 18 

Add 18 to both sides: 

4x = 36 

Divide both sides by 4: 

x = 9 

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $9. 

Now, we know that the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $9 = $19. 

The final answer is 19."
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

6 minibusses can hold 30 employees each, so 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since Lillian bought 3 of them, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Since she built 3 of them, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 25% of $4 is $1. So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to know how much money he had before buying the ticket. 

He had $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100. So, he must have had $100 + $50 = $150.

He sells the cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of them. This means he sells 2/3 of the cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, he sold 2/3 * x cards. 

Since he sold 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, the total money he got from selling the cards is 2/3 * x * 1.5.

We know that the total money he got from selling the cards is $150. So, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x * 1.5 = 150

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x * 1.5 = 150 * 3/2
x * 1.5 = 225

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 225 / 1.5
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."

The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the steps:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus slew, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth of what Prince Walter slew, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon. 
3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first find out how much money he spent on chips. 

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. So, he spent 3 x 40 cents = 120 cents on chips.

Since he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money on chips and candy bars. 

George spent $5, which is 500 cents. So, 99% of 500 cents is 0.99 x 500 = 495 cents.

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, he spent 495 - 120 = 375 cents on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. So, the number of candy bars he bought is 375 / 75 = 5.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. 

2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 

4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. 

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 for the onions and $4.00 for the beef stock. 

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving. 

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it takes Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne. 

So, Bernadette should leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since we can't leave a negative time, we need to find out how long Bernadette should leave before Wayne. 

If Bernadette leaves 1 minute before Wayne, she will arrive 4 minutes before Wayne."
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first find the width of the room. 

Since the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. There are 3 feet in 1 yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 x Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we know the length (9 feet) and the width (40 feet), we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 x (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 x 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect. The window is open for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, the cooling effect is 30 / 10 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature increase: 15 - 6 = 9 degrees.

The house's final temperature is 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it took James to finish the entire triathlon. 

First, we need to find out how long it took Jon to finish the entire triathlon. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, bike time is 1 hour 20 minutes (or 80 minutes), and run time is 50 minutes. 
So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We also know that James finished 10 minutes after Jon. 
So, James' total time is Jon's total time + 10 minutes. 
James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike time from his total time. 
James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The answer is 59."

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 
So, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, 
Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how far the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, and it runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can find the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 * 0.5 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and it runs 16 miles, it eats 8 bails of hay. 

A bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails cost 8 * 3 = $24. 

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30. 

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has: 
Change = Money - Cost 
Change = 30 - 24 
Change = 6 

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points.

Joey's points: 214
Marcy's points: 225
Marcy's score: 10

First, we subtract Marcy's score from her points: 225 - 10 = 215

Now, we subtract Marcy's new points from Joey's points: 214 - 215 = -1

Joey is now 1 point behind Marcy.

The final answer is -1."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 x $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is 539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the colors from the six packets with eight colors each and the four packets with sixteen colors each.

Six packets with eight colors each will have 6 x 8 = 48 colors.
Four packets with sixteen colors each will have 4 x 16 = 64 colors.

Now, we add the colors from both sets: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the regular price of popcorn is x.

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x.

The total cost of buying a super ticket is $20.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $2 less than the super ticket.

So, we can set up the equation: $15 + x = $20 - $2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: $15 + x = $18.

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get: x = $3.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. 

The cost of filling 20 balloons before the price increase was $900. So, the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase was $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon became $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase: $65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much money all her jewels are worth, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800. So, the value of 8 sapphires is 8 x $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the 2 rubies she got is 2 x $1200 = $2400.

The value of the 5 sapphires she has left is 5 x $800 = $4000.

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400 + $2400 + $4000 = $12800.

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of apples they eat per day by 30.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day. 
4 apples/day * 2 people = 8 apples/day
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

They eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised beds) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, we need to divide the total volume by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs.

Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 32 / 2
Number of bags = 16

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 16 * 12
Total cost = 192

The total cost of the potting soil will be $192."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. 

So, there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards of all colors: 
15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

The total number of cards is 78."
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially.
2. Half of the fairies that Katelyn saw came from the east and joined the fairies that were there. 
   - Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east.
   - Total fairies now are 50 (initial) + 25 (joined) = 75 fairies.
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   - Total fairies remaining are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add Jennifer's puppies and Brandon's puppies. 
8 (Jennifer's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20 puppies.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
3 (Jennifer's spotted puppies) + 4 (Brandon's spotted puppies) = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.
(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The answer is 35."
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:

3400 / 2250 = 1.51

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate how much she earns per week and then multiply it by 4.

She earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

In total, she earns 6 + 15 = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she earns 21 * 4 = 84 cents in a month.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants by multiplying Frederick's plants by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants * 1.6
Toni's plants = 10 * 1.6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. 

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. 
6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box.
5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards

Now, let's add the total number of basketball and baseball cards.
150 + 200 = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we need to subtract those from the total.
350 - 50 = 300 cards

She gives 10 cards to each student, so we need to divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students she has.
300 / 10 = 30

Miss Maria has 30 students."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
20 * 45 cents = 900 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 900 cents = 9 dollars
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, 1000 cents = 10 dollars
Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
10 percent of 10 dollars is 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar
Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's amount from Kelly's amount. 
9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how many pencils were used in total. Since 1/5 of the pencils were used, we multiply the total number of pencils by 1/5.
   Total pencils = 30
   Pencils used = 30 * 1/5 = 6

2. Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total to find the remaining pencils.
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   Remaining pencils = 30 - 6 = 24

3. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.
   Pencils left = Remaining pencils * 1/3
   Pencils left = 24 * 1/3 = 8

So, there are 8 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. 

There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long. So, the total length of the remoras is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

So, (12 / 10) x 100 = 120%

The combined length of the remoras is 120% of the shark's body length."

Now, we need to convert the total height from inches to feet. 
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is 48."
"Charisma gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour. There are 8 hours in a day. So, she walks 5 minutes * 8 hours = 40 minutes per day. 

There are 5 days. So, she walks 40 minutes * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find out how old she will be in four years. 

Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, so Angela's age in four years will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years: 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is 38."
"To find out how much Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the total cost of his morning rides and the total cost of his afternoon rides.

Morning rides cost $6 each, and he did them twice a day for 14 days. So, the total cost of morning rides is 6 * 2 * 14 = $168.

Afternoon rides cost $2 each, and he did them twice a day for 14 days. So, the total cost of afternoon rides is 2 * 2 * 14 = $56.

Now, we add the total cost of morning rides and afternoon rides to find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car. 168 + 56 = $224.

The final answer is: 224"
"To find out how many oranges they have, we need to add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the cost of food. The cost of food is $5 per guest, so if there are x guests, the total cost of food is 5x. The total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:
10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects they found is 43. 
So, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2x/2 + 7 = 43
This simplifies to: x + 7 = 43
Subtract 7 from both sides: x = 36

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found. 
David found x/2 = 36/2 = 18 insects.
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 36/2 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25 insects.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

First, we need to find the total amount of yarn used in terms of a whole skein. 
1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4 to find the total yards used. 
364 * 3/4 = 273 yards 

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to add the gifts she bought for her friends and the additional 10 random gifts.

For 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.
For 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 3 x 2 = 6.

Adding these together, we get 10 + 6 = 16 gifts for her friends.
Then, adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. 
The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to know how much she paid in total for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total cost for the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since she paid $7 in total, we subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total to find the cost of the strawberry gum. 

$7 - $3 = $4

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $4."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate how many sticks he can get from each type of wood and then choose the option that gives him the most sticks.

From a 2 x 4, he can get 200 sticks.
From a 2 x 8, he can get 400 sticks.

Since a 2 x 8 costs $6 and a 2 x 4 costs $4, buying 6 2 x 4s would cost $24, which is the same as the money he has.

So, Frederick can buy 6 2 x 4s and get 6 x 200 = 1200 sticks.

The answer is 1200."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes. 

First, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes. 
6 dogs * 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair. 
12 pairs * $12.00 = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

She takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows. 

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep. 

The zoo has 20 sheep. 

The total number of animals in the farm is 30 + 10 = 40. 

The total number of animals in the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80. 

The total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120."

"To find out how much calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose 30 pounds. 

First, we need to find out how many days are between December 31st and July 19th. 
December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 
Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to lose 30 pounds by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 211 days = approximately 500 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 500 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald works at a daycare and gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a week, which means he worked 7 days. 

To find out how much he got, we multiply the amount he gets per day by the number of days he worked: 
$30 * 7 = $210

He spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he got: 
$210 - $100 = $110

He has $110 left."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run. 

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer. She will run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out how many kilometers she will run. 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to know how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4. 

36 / 4 = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills. 
Ali has 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, Ali gives $80 to his sister and is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 
So, Ali uses $48 for dinner and is left with $80 - $48 = $32.

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find out how many problems Chris has left, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 x 12 = 36 problems.

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining problems. To find the number of remaining problems, we need to subtract the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of problems.

There were 100 problems initially. Chris completed 48 problems, so the number of remaining problems is 100 - 48 = 52.

One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, on Wednesday, Chris completed 13 problems.

Now, we need to subtract the problems completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from the total number of problems to find the number of problems left on Thursday.

The total number of problems completed is 12 + 36 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems left on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that can fit in a row, and the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we need to find the smallest number of rows that can accommodate both red and blue tulips. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3.

The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6. So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of flowers.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so there are 48 - 8 = 40 passengers left.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so there are 80 - 21 = 59 passengers left.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say James' current age is x.

In 5 years, James will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 years old, which is x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, James' current age is 5 years.

Now, we need to find the age difference between James and his cousin. James' cousin will be x + 10 years old in 8 years, which is 5 + 10 = 15 years old now. 

The age difference between James and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find out how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to first find out how much he saves in the first half of the month.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since there are 15 days in the first half of the month, he saves 15x dollars in the first half.

In the second half of the month, Elvis wants to save twice as much as he saves in the first half. So, he wants to save 2 * 15x = 30x dollars in the second half.

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, so he needs to save 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount of money they each get.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he gets 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she gets 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus' total to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money (100 dollars) by 5. 

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can represent the amount Brad gets as x. Then, Jeff gets 4x. 

The equation would be: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. 
4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work is 3 miles, so the distance he walks each day is 3 x 2 = 6 miles.

He works 5 times a week, so the total distance he walks in a week is 6 x 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to calculate the number of letters in each step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 + 26 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to calculate the number of new families contacted in each round.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are contacted.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are contacted.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are contacted.

So, in total, 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger will have 5 x 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than that, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

The final answer is 400."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together. 

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 notebooks: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator: $12
- 1 geometry set: $10

Now, let's add the costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $20:
10% of $20 = 0.10 x $20 = $2

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the hamburgers, the cost of the potato fries, and the cost of the fruit drinks.

The cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of the potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.

$50 - $33 = $17.

Carly gets $17 back."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

So, the total amount of money Antonella earned is $300 + $150 = $450.

"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 x 16 = 48 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as the cold water. Twice the time for cold water is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference between the time taken on a hot day and a cold day. That is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is 54."
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to first find out how much he earns in a week. 

He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 
So, he earns $2 * 5 * 4 = $40 per week.

Now, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by the amount he earns per week ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80. 
$80 / $40 = 2 weeks.

"To find Peter's locker size, we need to know the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

"To find the average weight, we need to know the total weight of all three friends. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3. 
540 / 3 = 180.

James needs candles for both sons. 

12 (older son) + 8 (younger son) = 20 candles

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, she read 70 pages in the first week. 

In the second week, she read 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we need to add the pages she read in the first week and the second week.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. The previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, so half of that is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the money: 
$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00."
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the information given.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Peter spent $5 each on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. There are 3 days, so he spent 3 * $5 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $15, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days, so he will spend 3 * $2 = $6.

He has $55 left and spent $6, so he has $55 - $6 = $49 left.

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $49 / $2 = 24.5 plastic action figures. But you can't buy half a figure, so he can buy 24 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 24 plastic action figures.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply to the shops every week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
Total roses needed per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses needed per week by 4.
Total roses needed per month = 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. 
Roses Ford lacks per month = Total roses needed per month - Roses Ford grows per month

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00. 

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. 

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

The net profit is $37.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 

3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we can multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468 and the set temperature is 450. 

First, we find the difference: 468 - 450 = 18. 

Then, we divide the difference by the set temperature: 18 / 450 = 0.04. 

Now, we multiply this by 100 to get the percentage: 0.04 * 100 = 4%. 

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find 4% of the recipe's temperature. 

4% of 520 is 0.04 * 520 = 20.8. 

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the movies, we need to add the time of the first movie and the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. 
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. 
2 hours is equal to 120 minutes. 
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) and the time of the second movie (125 minutes). 
90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and it's 10% off, the discount is $10.00. 

The cost of 2 boxes is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we need to find out how many days 90 contacts will last for 2 boxes. 
90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will need 2 * 2 = 4 contacts per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days 2 boxes will last. 
Since 2 boxes have 90 contacts, 2 boxes will last 90 / 2 = 45 days.

So, the contacts will last for 45 days. 

The cost of each pair of contacts is $90.00 / 45 days = $2.00 per day.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. 

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. So, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200. 

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8. 

Hannah needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation to get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

Now we have three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we need to add them together and divide by 3.

47 + 52 + 57 = 156
156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them invited 2 friends. So, the number of people invited by Alex's friends is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 of her friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the people invited by Alex, her friends, and their spouses. The total number of people is 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

So, Alex needs 318 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 x $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the beanstalk needs to double to be taller than Mark's window. 

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the third day.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

He eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, and each mushroom has 3 grams of protein. 

So, the amount of protein he gets per day is 200 grams * 3 grams = 600 grams.

There are 7 days in a week. 

So, the amount of protein he gets per week is 600 grams * 7 days = 4200 grams.

"Let's say Jerry's current age is x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's call the smallest angle 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, that angle is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

He has 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 = 200 cents.

He has 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 = 60 cents.

He has 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, 14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 = 70 cents.

He has 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent. So, 15 pennies are worth 15 x 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to count the legs of each type of pet. 

Dogs have 4 legs, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add up the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses now, we need to first calculate the weight he used after increasing it by 50%. 

The original weight is 8 pounds. 
50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 
So, the weight after increasing is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

Then, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 
So, the weight he uses now is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) + 24 (additional) = 41 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 41 + 5 = 46 games

Steve has 46 games after 3 years."
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2. 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz in 1 hour. So, we multiply 60 by 3/4. 60 * 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 1 hour. We add Ruiz's and Marissa's production. 60 + 45 = 105 pounds per hour.

They worked for 12 hours in a day. To find the total amount of chocolates they made, we multiply their combined production by 12. 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 1260 pounds."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Howard spent $8 on Monday. 
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16. 
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64. 

Now, let's add up the money he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88. 

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the money he spent: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the money he earned in the first four hours and the next two hours separately.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade. Since each cup costs $0.50, he earned 60 * 0.50 = $30.

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade. Since each cup costs $0.60, he earned 20 * 0.60 = $12.

To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to add the money he earned in the first four hours and the next two hours. So, $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12. 

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Now, we need to find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven in a year by 2.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to find out how many years the tire will last. 

We know the tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4380 years

The tire will last for 4380 years before it needs to be replaced."
"To find out how many washings one pump gives, we need to divide the total number of washings by the number of pumps used. 

120 washings / 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump.

Now, we need to find out how much one pump costs. We know the total cost is $24.00. 

$24.00 / 60 washings = $0.40 per washing.

Since we want the cost in cents, we need to multiply by 100.

$0.40 * 100 = 40 cents per pump.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he's buying. 

First, we need to find the discount on the shirt. The shirt is $25 and there's a 30% discount. 
30% of $25 is 0.3 x $25 = $7.50. 
So the discount on the shirt is $7.50. 
The price of the shirt after the discount is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the items Joe is buying is $17.50 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Let's assume it's 8% for simplicity. 
8% of $52.50 is 0.08 x $52.50 = $4.20. 
The total cost with sales tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Joe has $50 initially. 
He will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we first need to know how many croissants he wants to make. He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. 

Since 1 dozen is 12, 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 croissants. 

Now, we need to find out how many croissants he will make in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so he will make 48 x 7 = 336 croissants.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by 1/4. 

So, 336 croissants x 1/4 = 336/4 = 84 pounds of butter.

The answer is 84."

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and divide by his annual growth.

First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 40 inches is 40 / 12 = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. To find the difference, we subtract Adam's height from the required height: 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet.

Now, we divide the difference by his annual growth: 0.67 / 2 = 0.335 years.

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Adam approximately 1 year to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we subtract $400 from the price of gold.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we need to add up the number of stamps Max bought: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the difference in their speeds and divide it by the difference in their speeds.

First, let's find the difference in their speeds: 
Bob's speed - Tom's speed = 55 - 70 = -15 miles per hour. Since speed can't be negative, we need to find the difference in distance instead. 
The difference in distance is 75 miles.

Now, we divide the difference in distance by the difference in their speeds: 
75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to know how many fish Darren caught. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. His parents are willing to pay $10 per class. 

To find out how many classes they are willing to pay for, we divide the total cost by the cost per class: 
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has 10 classes, and his parents are only willing to pay for 6 classes, he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"Since Jewel processes 50 customers a day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day. 

If they work all 7 days of the week, the total number of customers Jewel processes is 50 * 7 = 350. 
The total number of customers Julie processes is 100 * 7 = 700. 

The total number of customers processed by both of them in a week is 350 + 700 = 1050."
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to know how many miles Reggie ran. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately.

First, we find the cost of 1 apple: 
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

Now, we find the cost of 1 orange: 
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Next, we multiply the cost of 1 apple by 5: 
$1.30 * 5 = $6.50

Then, we multiply the cost of 1 orange by 5: 
$1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: 
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features: 
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $42,000.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $42,000."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the raise: 
5% of $20000 is 0.05 x $20000 = $1000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Now, let's add the bonus: 
Half a month's salary is $20000 / 2 = $10000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Now, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year: 
$31000 x 12 = $372000.

The final answer is: $372000."

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find Steve's son's wife's age, we need to follow the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

There are 8 portions in one bag, and 3 bags.

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Speed of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 24 / 4
Time = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Speed of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 / 2
Time = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 + 4
Total time = 10 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."

He wants 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

First, we add the number of classmates: 25 classmates * 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes

Then, we add the number of cupcakes for himself and his teacher: 2 (himself) + 2 (teacher) = 4 cupcakes

Now, we add the number of cupcakes for the classmates and the number of cupcakes for himself and his teacher: 50 cupcakes + 4 cupcakes = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the total number of likes, we need to first find the number of likes after three weeks. 

The number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes. 
Initial likes = 2000
Likes after three weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000

Then, we add the 20000 new likes to get the total number of likes.
Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000

The final answer is 160000."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was 20 * 18 = $360.

The next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount, so the price per pomegranate was 30 * 0.9 = $27. The total cost was 20 * 27 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 360 = $180."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know how much she made from green hats. 

Let's say the amount she made from green hats is x. 
Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can say that 400 = x/2. 
To find x, we multiply both sides by 2. 
x = 400 * 2 
x = 800 

So, in the first month, she made $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats. 
Total amount in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
Total sales in the first month = 1200 
3/4 of 1200 = (3/4) * 1200 = 900 

So, in the second month, she made $900. 
Total amount in two months = 1200 + 900 = 2100 

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he used the carriage. 

He used the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he used 4 - 1 = 3 paid hours.

The first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the next two hours are 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Since the amount in her bank account is more than her weekly wage, it means that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The answer is 2."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost. 

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 
The monthly rent is $5000. 
The fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. 

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000. 

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000. 

The total cost for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (yearly rent and fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is: 330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork. 

We know that it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs and heads for each animal. 

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head. 
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so s + g = 20.

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation: 
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find out how much everything cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of coffee will cost 7 x $6 = $42. 

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
So, Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
So, Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars. 

If they add their money together, they have 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars. 
If they share it equally among themselves, each person gets 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards. 

Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. 

Let's say Sally has x books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books. 

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, he had 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needed 12 toys.

When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left. So, there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. 

However, 3 dogs were gone, so he only needed toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies.

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies.

Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now, we know the number of cookies each person has. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has.

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61
Total cookies = 202

The final answer is: 202"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress. 

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We need to subtract the 20cm added to the bottom to find the length before the lace trim was added. 

140 - 20 = 120

Now, we know the length before the lace trim was added. We need to reverse the 50% increase. To do this, we can divide the length by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5). 

120 / 1.5 = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to add the time it took him to mow half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to find the average of the two times.

Average time = (60 + 40) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

6 + 13 = 19 minutes

30 - 19 = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Catherine paid $14 in total."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. In total, they bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. They eat 10 cookies, so they put 90 - 10 = 80 cookies in the box.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the age of the younger triplet is x. Then, the ages of the other two triplets will be x + 1 and x + 2. 

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the twin will be x + 7.

The sum of their ages is 44. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 
4x + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
4x = 34

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 8.5

Since we can't have half a year, we'll round down to 8 for the age of the younger triplet. 

The age of the twin is x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he spends on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (10/4).
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year

Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, we multiply the yearly savings by 10.
240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
2/5 of 20 coins is 8 coins. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we multiply the number of coins Neil saves per month by the number of months in a year.
28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year

Since Neil has been saving for 10 years, we multiply the yearly savings by 10.
336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

Now, we add the total coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years.
2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines + heartworm check). 
Since we don't know the total bill yet, let's represent it as x. 
So, the heartworm check is 0.6 * (40 + 0.6x). 
Now, the total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = 40 + 0.6 * (40 + 0.6x). 
Simplifying the equation, we get x = 40 + 24 + 0.36x. 
Combine like terms: x = 64 + 0.36x. 
Subtract 0.36x from both sides: 0.64x = 64. 
Divide both sides by 0.64: x = 100. 
Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * 100 = $60. 
The total cost is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100. 
John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Now, we know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits. 

The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color. 

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to know how many regular chairs she has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs. 

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs. 

8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there are 57 people attending the function (42 adults + 15 babies), and Mia already has 48 chairs, we subtract 48 from 57 to find out how many more chairs she needs.

57 - 48 = 9

The answer is 9."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks by dividing 50 by 2.

50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to find 20% of 25. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2.

25 * 0.2 = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students.

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. 
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 
Adam has 50 points, Betty has 65 points, Tom has 35 points, and Marta has 105 points. 
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."
"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of grandchildren and then multiply it by 3.

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children, so the number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so the number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

First, we calculate 50% of her paycheck: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Then, we calculate 20% of her paycheck for the car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she put into her retirement account and the car payment from her original paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

720"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to know how many pencils are in the box. 

We know there's space for 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. So, the number of pencils in the box is 20 - 4 = 16.

Now, to find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2. 

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

8"
"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is 15 x 20 = 300.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, we need to find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in the city. Since she can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 300 x 0.4 = 120.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah will see in the city and in her backyard. 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is 135."
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks bought.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 more friends they meet up with). 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 14 people, we can divide 14 by 5 (2+3) to find out how many sets of drinks and snacks are needed. 14 / 5 = 2.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of a set, we round up to 3 sets.

So, 3 sets of drinks and snacks are needed. Each set costs $2, so 3 sets cost 3 x $2 = $6.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $6."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the total amount of gravel that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry is 11,600 - 4,000 = 7,600 pounds.

Since we know that Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds of gravel, we can subtract this from the total amount that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry to find out how much Gary's truck can carry. 

7,600 - 4,800 = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. 

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings the males ate is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings the females ate is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he had initially. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he had 3/5 of the total money. 

3/5 of $100 is (3/5) * 100 = $60. 

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many hours they need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount they already raised ($2100) from their goal ($6300). 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we need to find out how many hours it takes to raise $4200 at the same rate. 

To do this, we can divide $4200 by $2100 (the amount they raised in 3 hours). 

$4200 ÷ $2100 = 2

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percent of the river's total water used by the city. 

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we need to find the percent of the river's total water that is not used for industrial purposes. 

To do this, we subtract the percent used for industrial purposes from 100%: 
100% - 80% = 20%

So, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find out how many days are in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 x 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 14 days x $12 per day = $168.

The final answer is 168."
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the number of quarts made per hour for each flavor and then multiply it by the number of hours.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. 
So, it makes 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. 
So, it makes 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many quarts of each flavor will be made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream, 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream, 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Total quarts made in 48 hours = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece will be 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each will be 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00. 
10% of $50.00 is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can buy with her money. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can think of it as buying 3 scoops for the price of 2 scoops. 

So, the cost of 3 scoops is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50. 

Erin has $6.00, so she can buy 3 scoops. 

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how many pieces she eats in two weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days. 

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.

Amy started with 100 pieces, so after eating 42 pieces, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces.

Ginger started with 100 pieces, so after eating 56 pieces, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces. To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's candy from Amy's candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The answer is 14."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing it and compare it to the cost of the fine he would get.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. Ron needs 3 buckets, and each bucket costs $25. So, the total cost of asphalt is 3 x $25 = $75.

Now, let's add the cost of the asphalt to the fine he would get. The fine is $120, and the cost of asphalt is $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

The pothole would cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed. So, by fixing it himself, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"

193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent to the carpenter = 160 chairs left.

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 x 2/3 = 2 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. Since 1 pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1 ½ x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices they ate from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

One foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the extra 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

So, we can write the equation as: 9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars: 
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 + 64 = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools.

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.
(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the number of people who voted by midday. 
   2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday. 
   2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

2. Now, find the number of people remaining after midday. 
   Total people - people who voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remaining.

3. Next, find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 
   2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00. 
   2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

4. Now, find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
   Total people remaining - people who voted by 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

"To find out how many packs Parker needs, we need to divide the number of days he wants the gum to last by the number of days he chews per day. 

First, we multiply the number of days he chews per day by the number of days he wants the gum to last: 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces per pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find out how many smores the kids want, we multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults want, we multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants: 6 adults * 1 s'more = 6 smores.

Now, we add the number of smores the kids and adults want: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

The answer is 1."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to find their individual ages first.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, let's add their ages together: 
Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know that her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. 

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds. 

We also know that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, so 50% of the votes is 2 * 20% = 40%. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so candidate B got 20% + 40% = 60% of the votes.

Now, we know that candidate A got 20% and candidate B got 60% of the votes. The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. 

100% - 20% - 60% = 20%. 

So, candidate C got 20% of the votes. 

To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to calculate 20% of 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20.

The answer is 20."
"To find out how many apples Beck has now, we need to subtract 23 from 23 (the number of apples Beck had) and then add 10 (the number of apples Boris gave to Beck). 

23 - 23 = 0
0 + 10 = 10

So Beck now has 10 apples. 

Boris also gave away 10 apples, so he now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has.

90 - 10 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate how much water he used for each type of cube.

For giant cubes, he used 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces.

For medium cubes, he used 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces.

For small cubes, he used 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water left.

"To find out how many books Clara has more than Alice, we need to know how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. 

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we need to know how many like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. 

Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake and play basketball is 10 + 5 = 15. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

8 + 20 = 28 

There are 28 birds in the backyard now."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first find the total number of students in each class. 

Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2 to get the number of students in each class. 

80 / 2 = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply the number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form).

40 * 0.4 = 16

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To find the total cost, Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

For the first amusement park, the cost is:
- 2 adults * $26 = $52
- 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the cost is:
- 2 adults * $14 = $28
- 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost = $28 + $20 = $48

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. 
We divide 54 students by 12 groups: 54 ÷ 12 = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have half a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, each group needs 5 students.

Now, we need to find out how many groups are needed for 54 students with 5 students in each group. 
We divide 54 students by 5 students per group: 54 ÷ 5 = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, 11 groups are needed.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we already have from the number of groups we need: 
11 groups - 12 groups = -1 group.

However, we can't have a negative number of groups. This means we need to re-evaluate the question. 

The question states that the activity requires 12 groups, but we calculated that we need 11 groups. This means we actually have more groups than needed. 

So, we don't need any more groups.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs

Total chairs per week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total chairs rented in a month: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs/month

In two 4-week months, the total chairs rented: 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

"To find out how many bananas Gunther had, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Gunther started with 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so we need to divide 48 by 2. 48 / 2 = 24. 

So, Arnold took 24 bananas, and Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas. So, we need to subtract 12 from 49. 49 - 12 = 37.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
She gets 27 large buttons for these small stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
She gets 20 large buttons for these large stickers.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
She trades these 20 large stickers for 20 small stickers.

Now, she has 27 large buttons, 20 large stickers, and 50 small stickers.

To find the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large stickers to small buttons. 
Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers. 
Adding these to the 50 small stickers she already has, she now has 60 + 50 = 110 small stickers.

Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, 27 large buttons are worth 27 * 3 = 81 small stickers. 
Adding these to the 110 small stickers she already has, she now has 81 + 110 = 191 small stickers.

So, Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 191 small stickers by the end.

The final answer is 218."

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's call the number of votes against it ""x"". 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

We know that the total number of votes is 33. The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, so we can write the equation: 

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

11 students need size extra-small.
Twice as many students need size small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.
Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He already made $60 from eggplants, so he needs to make 135 - 60 = $75 from corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear for, we need to divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

75 ÷ 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first find the total time she has available. 

She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 
   1/2 of 50 is 25, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 
   Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 
   3/5 of 25 is 15, so he gave 15 pencils to Charlie. 
   Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. 
For the motorcycles, Henry needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

In total, Henry needs 228 wheels for the cars + 146 wheels for the motorcycles = 374 wheels.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276.

The answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, I need to calculate 20% of the original price. 

20% of $1000 is 0.20 * 1000 = $200.

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. 

$1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can divide 600 by 3.

600 / 3 = 200

So, there are 200 movies in series. These cost $6 each, but we need to buy the whole series together, so we multiply by 6.

200 * 6 = 1200

Now, we need to find out how many movies are not in series. We subtract the movies in series from the total.

600 - 200 = 400

Now, 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. We can find 40% of 400.

40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

These older movies cost $5 each. We multiply by 5.

160 * 5 = 800

Now, we have the cost of the series and the older movies. We add them together.

1200 + 800 = 2000

The cost of replacing the movies is $2000."
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

Peaches cost $2.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of peaches is 6 x $2.00 = $12.00.

Plums cost $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds, so the cost of plums is 8 x $1.00 = $8.00.

Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of apricots is 6 x $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

They drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25. 25 - 5 is 20. So, they hiked at 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours. Distance = speed * time. So, distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them got.

Let's say Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A. 

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 + Ava's berries. Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on Ava's enemies - 8.

Emma's score is 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) + 30 * (Ava's time - 4).

Ava's score is 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time.

Since Ava's score is A, we can set up the equation: 
A = 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)
A = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120
A = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5A + 30Ava's time - 120
A = 15A + 30Ava's time - 185

Now, we need to find Ava's time. We know that Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Ava. So, Ava's time is 4 seconds faster than Emma's time. Let's say Emma's time is x. Then Ava's time is x - 4.

Now we can substitute Ava's time in the equation:
A = 15A + 30(x - 4) - 185
A = 15A + 30x - 120 - 185
A = 15A + 30x - 305

Now we need to find the value of x. We know that Ava's score is equal to Emma's score. So, we can set up the equation:
10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120 = 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)
10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120 = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120
10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120 = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120
10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120 = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5Ava's berries + 30Ava's time - 120
-80 + 15 - 120 = 0
-185 = 0

This equation is not solvable, so we need to find another way to solve the problem.

Let's go back to the equation A = 15A + 30(x - 4) - 185. We can simplify it:
A = 15A + 30x - 120 - 185
A = 15A + 30x - 305
-14A = 30x - 305

Now we can solve for A:
-14A = 30x - 305
-14A + 305 = 30x
305 - 14A = 30x

Now we can solve for x:
305 - 14A = 30x
305 = 30x + 14A
305 - 14A = 30x
305 - 14A - 30x = 0
305 - 30x - 14A = 0
305 - 30x = 14A
305 - 30x = 14A
305 - 14A = 30x

Now we can solve for x:
305 - 14A = 30x
305 - 14A = 30x
305 - 14A = 30x
305 - 14A = 30x

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract 30 dollars from 64 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide 34 dollars by 2:
34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find out how many times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day. There are 5 usual days, so they ride 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. They ride 2 * 3 = 6 times on each of the two extra days. So, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times on the extra days.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on both types of days. 15 + 12 = 27.

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

When the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish decreased by 3 (since there were 3 orange fish initially) and the number of white fish decreased by 4 (since there were 4 white fish initially). 

So, the number of orange fish after the sales assistant took out 17 fish is 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish. 

However, this is not possible, so we need to consider the number of white fish. 

Let's assume the number of white fish after the sales assistant took out 17 fish is x. 

Since the number of orange fish is now twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation: 0 = 2x.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

Let's re-examine the situation. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. When the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish decreased by 3, but the number of white fish decreased by 4. 

So, the number of white fish after the sales assistant took out 17 fish is 4 - 4 = 0 white fish.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week and then multiply it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip is 10 miles. 

So, the total miles driven in a week is 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a week. We know his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so we divide the total miles driven by his fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we multiply the gallons used by the price of gas to find the total cost:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

The answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties. She spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is 6. So, she spent 6 twenties.

She was given 140 quarters. She spent all of them.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent. 
6 twenties = 6 * 20 = 120 dollars
140 quarters = 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars

Total amount spent = 120 + 35 = 155 dollars

The final answer is: 155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so that's 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so that's 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first find out how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150. Now, we need to subtract the money John has from the amount the school will cover to find out how much he is missing.

$150 - $50 = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the temperature where the pipes won't freeze.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group had.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The answer is 12."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the people who got off and add the people who got on at each stop.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125.

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 * 30 = 300

Then, multiply the result by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 * .25 = 75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Then, we need to find out how many additional hours she worked:
11 hours (total) - 8 hours (regular) = 3 hours

Now, we need to calculate her earnings for the additional hours at the special rate:
3 hours * $20/hour * 1.5 (150% of regular rate) = 3 * 20 * 1.5 = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 
12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions. 
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32 lions.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to first calculate the discount on the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. The discount is 25%. 

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10. 

So, the price of the jeans after the discount is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. 

To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill. 

$50 - $30 = $20.

The answer is 20."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then multiply it by the salary of each employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months will be:
260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they will sing it twice, so that's 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. 
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they will sing it once, so that's 1 x 240 = 240 seconds. 

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, we need to calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours. 
Billy's earnings = $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's earnings = $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings.
$230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2

Now, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to first find half of Pierson's score. 

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of that is 278 / 2 = 139 points. 

Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total points, we need to add Pierson's and Nikita's scores. 

278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428 points.

The total points is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the children and the number of trees planted by the teachers.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the children. There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Since each child plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the children is also 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers in each class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, let's add the number of trees planted by the children and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has. 

Three puppies + five koalas + two zebras + four frogs = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. To do this, we multiply 14 by 0.3.

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played half an hour every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, which is 2 x 7 = 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours, so she played 0.5 x 14 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the last week, Kris played 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played 2 x 7 = 14 hours in the last week.

To find the total hours Kris has played, we need to add the hours from the first 2 weeks and the hours from the last week. 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours. So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is 9."
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them. 

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.
The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.
$900 * 0.3 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost.
$900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders passed: 340
Fourth-graders passed: 40
Fifth-graders passed: 40 * 2 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students passed / Total students) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with two bags of glass chips.

Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag.

72 / 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches he can make with one bag by 2.

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags of glass chips. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many square inches he can make in three inches.

To do this, we multiply the number of square inches he can make with two bags by 3.

12 * 3 = 36 square inches

So, Milo can make 36 square inches of mosaic. Since there are 144 square inches in one square inch, we divide 36 by 144 to find out how many inches long his mosaic can be.

36 / 144 = 0.25 inches

The final answer is 0.25."
"To find out how many quarts of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to add the quarts of tea that the students drank and add that to the quarts of tea left.

First, let's calculate the total quarts of tea the students drank. 
4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Now, let's add the quarts of tea the students drank to the quarts of tea left.
6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to divide 38 quarts by 4 to find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party.
38 ÷ 4 = 9.5 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has in total. 

He started with 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many he has left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. 
The number of additional students by the end of May is 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. 

Felix made $105 in a week. There are 7 days in a week. 

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Now, we divide the total branches by 7 to find out how many branches he climbed per day.

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the first type of flowers: 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 
3 x 5 = 15 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the second type of flowers: 4 flowers with 6 petals each. 
4 x 6 = 24 petals

Then, let's calculate the total number of petals for the third type of flowers: 5 flowers with 4 petals each. 
5 x 4 = 20 petals

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of petals for the fourth type of flowers: 6 flowers with 7 petals each. 
6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for all types of flowers together: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of petals. 
101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) = 17 marshmallows left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores. Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long each person plays and then multiply that by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friend plays for 10 minutes, and the other friend plays for 15 minutes. The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total minutes played: 
20 (Jack) + 10 (friend 1) + 15 (friend 2) + 30 (friend 3) = 75 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 20-minute intervals are in 75 minutes. 
75 / 20 = 3.75.

Since you can't play a fraction of a game, we'll round down to 3 games. 

Now, we multiply the number of games by the cost per game. 
3 x $0.25 = $0.75.

The answer is 75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

We also know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. Let's call the amount of citrus zest and fragrance y ounces.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

x (salt) + x (sugar) + 2x (oil) + y (citrus zest) + y (fragrance) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x + 2y = 10

We know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, so we can substitute x for y:

4x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5/3

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x
Oil = 2(5/3)
Oil = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide 10 by 3:

Oil = 3.33

So, Tanya uses approximately 3.33 ounces of oil.

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes he already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total cupcakes needed:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 x 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling. After giving away 16 cars to his mother, he has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount from students by the number of students.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked for half of the time she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 
480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch break. 
   Initially, there were 50 cars. Then, 20 more cars came in, so the total number of cars is 50 + 20 = 70.

2. Then, 1/2 of the cars left. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35.

3. So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the number of cars that were left, we subtract 35 from 70, which is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns in a day and then multiply it by 7.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the total amount he earns in a cycle is 5 x $1.20 = $6.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, the total amount he earns in a day is 30 x $6 = $180.

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find the weekly earnings: $180 x 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.
3. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food. 
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

She had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will get.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the shipping cost is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40.

The book is 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the shipping cost is 20 x $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund is 0.75 x $32 = $24.

Since Milly has to pay the shipping cost, she will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$0.00."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to add the money she had initially and the money her father gave her, then subtract the money she spent.

Mulan had $40 initially.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60.
She also bought a bag for $20.

Now, let's subtract the money she spent: $140 - $60 - $20 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the amount he produces each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know how much he produces in the first three weeks. 

The total amount produced in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we subtract the amount produced in the first three weeks from the total to find the amount produced in the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The answer is 14,000."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok per week and then multiply it by 4.

She records 18 videos per week, so that's 18 * 4 minutes = 72 minutes per week.

She spends 2 hours (120 minutes) per week writing songs, and 15 minutes per day (6 days a week) doing her makeup, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

Total time spent on TikTok per week is 72 + 90 = 162 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 162 minutes is equal to 162 / 60 = 2.7 hours per week.

Now, we multiply the time spent on TikTok per week by 4 to get the time spent in a month: 2.7 * 4 = 10.8 hours.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the items Angela needs installed and the cost of the items that are already included in the initial package.

The initial package includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela needs 6 mirrors, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. She also needs 2 additional chandeliers. She has 20 pictures, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the cost of the additional mirrors is 2 x $15.00 = $30.00. The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 x $15.00 = $30.00. The cost of the additional pictures is 10 x $15.00 = $150.00.

The initial package costs $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $30.00 + $150.00 = $210.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high each person can lift a mountain. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can divide 18 hours by 3 to find the time it would take for 1 kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours for 1 kangaroo

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is 1/2 of the speed of a kangaroo. 

Speed of a turtle = 1/2 * speed of a kangaroo
Speed of a turtle = 1/2 * 6 hours
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Since 4 turtles are traveling, we need to multiply the time it takes for 1 turtle by 4.

Time for 4 turtles = 4 * 3 hours
Time for 4 turtles = 12 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know how much. Let's call that amount x.

She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. So, the total amount she has now is x + $150 + $80.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation:
x + $150 + $80 = $400 + $50

Combine the constants on the left side: 
x + $230 = $450

Now, subtract $230 from both sides to solve for x:
x = $450 - $230
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we can't have negative length, we need to recheck our calculation.

Let's recheck the calculation: 
The first glue stick has 5/6 used, so it has 1/6 left. 
1/6 of 12 millimeters is 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 1/3 used, so it has 2/3 left.

Total = 120 (Peter's dishes) + 120 (Jack's dishes) + 120 (Jack's socks) + 240 (Peter's socks) = 600

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 600."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

First, let's add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only: 5 + 8 = 13

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of students: 20 - 13 = 7

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at math is the sum of students good at math only and students good at both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract the time taken by the intermission.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Now, we subtract the time taken by the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time of the concert (120 minutes). 
120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform.
110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

In the first year, Brenda will earn $225 in interest, so she will have $300 + $225 = $525.

In the second year, she will earn $225 in interest again, so she will have $525 + $225 = $750.

In the third year, she will earn $225 in interest again, so she will have $750 + $225 = $975.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to know that half of the white shirts have collars. So, half of 40 is 20. That means 20 white shirts have collars. 

Now, we subtract 20 from 40 to find the number of white shirts with no collars: 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. So, we subtract 20 from 50 to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

The answer is 10."
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. 

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the total number of goats in each farm.

Farm X had 55 goats initially and 10 goats were sold. 
55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

Farm Y had 45 goats initially and twice as many goats were sold, so 2 x 10 = 20 goats were sold.
45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs he buys.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys 2 x 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. 

To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs: $2640 ÷ 24 = $110.

The average cost per pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. 

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75. 
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54. 
Since we get $2 off for each basket of red food, we subtract $6 from the cost of the red food. 
So, the cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48. 
The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean half of the rooms, we need to first find the total time it takes to clean all the rooms. 

There are 90 rooms, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, the total time to clean all the rooms is 90 * 20 = 1800 minutes.

Since we want to clean half of the rooms, we need to divide the total time by 2. 

1800 / 2 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

900 / 60 = 15 hours.

The answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and add them together.

In the first year, they will build 12 homes.

In the next year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, so they will build 3 x 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the second year, so they will build 2 x 36 = 72 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 72 = 120.

The town will have built 120 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am 3 years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- Let B be my brother's age.
- Let S be my sister's age.
- Let M be my mom's age.
- Let A be my age.

From the information given:
1. A = B - 3
2. A = S + 2
3. M = 3B - 1

We know that the sum of our ages is 87:
A + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for A and M:
(B - 3) + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
4B + S - 4 = 87

Now, we need to find a way to express S in terms of B. We can use the second equation:
S = A - 2
S = (B - 3) - 2
S = B - 5

Substitute S in the combined equation:
4B + (B - 5) - 4 = 87

Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since age can't be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't be a fraction of a year old. So, B = 19.

Now that we know B, we can find S:
S = B - 5
S = 19 - 5
S = 14

And A:
A = B - 3
A = 19 - 3
A = 16

So, I am 16 years old.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of glue sticks each student gets. 

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks needed

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed.

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks for all the students."
"So, the river initially had 4000 gallons of water. After the first day, the water doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. On the third day, the water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are infected initially.
Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount of money Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20. 10% of $20 is 0.1 x $20 = $2. 

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, she received $20 - $2 = $18.

Now, we add the amount of money Rafaela received and the amount Julieta received. 
$20 + $18 = $38.

The answer is 38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we need to subtract the number of oranges she gave to her daughters and the boy from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 x 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 (total oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns. 

36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

The answer is 30."
"Paige baked 2 loaves of banana bread per hour. She baked for 5 hours, so she made 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she made 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so she made 80 * 0.50 = $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to know how many silver coins she had. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can write the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 
So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
40 (silver) + 70 (gold) = 110 

The total number of coins Gretchen had is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The rink has 12 red cars.
- They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
- They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 
75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. If we let the number of books Anne has be x, then Sofie has x + 25 books.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. So, if Fawn has y books, then Anne has y - 12 books.

Since Sofie and Anne together have 85 books, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 25) = 85

Combine like terms: 
2x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 
2x = 60

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 30

So, Anne has 30 books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has 30 + 12 = 42 books.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find out how much the sweet potatoes weighed. 

The sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. Since the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello boxes Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of jello cups each kid will get. 

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since each box makes 10 jello cups, we need to divide the total number of jello cups by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs.

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the price of each box to find out how much Greg will spend.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $400 by 4 to get the weekly cost. 

$400 / 4 = $100 per week

Now, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the cost. To find out how much she pays per week, we multiply the weekly cost by 0.6 (which is 60%).

$100 * 0.6 = $60

Since Keenan pays the rest, we subtract Madeline's share from the total weekly cost.

$100 - $60 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
He ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12 pieces left.

So, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants. 
So, the number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

The remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
The number of outdoor plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
So, the number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

The rest are flowering plants. 
The number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to know the price of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which is $6 + $3 = $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she pays for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to know how much she was paid for each lawn. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, and she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. 

Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she was paid $6 for it. 

So, for Kamala's lawn, she was paid 3 * $6 = $18. 
For Alba's lawn, she was paid 5 * $6 = $30. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $18 + $30 = $48. 

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the total amount she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings. 
$80 - $48 = $32.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from renting his car:
10 times a month * 3 hours per time * $25 per hour = 10 * 3 * 25 = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
$750 - $500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had.

7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 (but since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we'll round down to 2)

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks. So, she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

Joseph had 2 notebooks. Martha now has 12 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's.

12 - 2 = 10

Joseph has 10 fewer notebooks than Martha."
"Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, so Anis rowed 50 + (1/5 * 50) = 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

The total distance they rowed is 50 + 60 = 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. 

Susan had 100 cookies initially. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages. Denise read 10 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 

Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, the difference between what Denise read today and what Daniel read yesterday is 18 - 13 = 5 pages.

The answer is 5."
"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first find out how many bowls of soup are left after everyone eats dinner.

There are 4 adult bowls and 2 child bowls, so that's 6 bowls in total. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. That leaves 6 - 2 = 4 bowls for the children.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the remaining 4 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 4 ÷ 2 = 2.

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To find out how much William spent, we need to add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. 
5 notebooks * $1.50 = $7.50

Now, let's add the cost of the ballpen. 
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8

So, William spent $8 in total."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, she needs 2 yards of material for each mask. 
So, for 20 small masks, she needs 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

For large masks, she needs 2.25 yards of material for each mask. 
So, for 8 large masks, she needs 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

In total, Jo needs 40 + 18 = 58 yards of material.

58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, so she has seen 9 movies * 3 times = 27 times.

The total amount spent is $216. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he sleeps, works, and walks his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find out how many blue shoe boxes are left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 

7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes and subtract that from the total number of red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 (total red shoe boxes) is 3. 
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

4"
"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to first find out how many books he had before he lost any. 

Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so Joseph had 2 x 9 = 18 books.

Then, Joseph lost 2 books. So, he now has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 6. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. 

Now, we need to subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Adam's current age. 

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. 

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation: 
D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write another equation: 
D = 60

Now we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation: 
60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years: 
A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

The final answer is 38."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so it is 2 x 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 
The total number of acres for both farms is 200 + 500 = 700 acres."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes in a day. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours a day, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a day.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a day.

The final answer is 64."
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on both puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

225 / 30 = 7.5

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To find out how many yellow balloons there were, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know there were 20 red balloons. So, the total bologna thrown at the red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, the bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon. So, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

The answer is 6."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000. 

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 5 x 2 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent.

First, they bought a cake for $11. Then, they bought 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. The price of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the price of 12 balloons is 12 * 0.5 = $6. 

They spent $11 + $6 = $17 on the cake and the balloons. 

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so they spent 2 * $7 = $14 on ice cream.

The total amount of money they spent is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount they spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave them. $31 / 2 = $15.5.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."

There are 6 students playing tennis.
There are twice that number playing volleyball, so 2 x 6 = 12 students are playing volleyball.
There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so 16 + 22 = 38 students are playing soccer.

Now, let's add the students from each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

The total number of students is 56."
"To find the total amount of money the class raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

The class raised $90 from selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to know how much each person eats per day.

"To find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, we need to first find out how much water is in the tank initially. 

The pool has 10000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount. Half of 10000 is 5000 gallons. 

So, the tank has 5000 gallons of water initially. 

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. After 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons. 

So, the amount of water left in the tank after 6 days is 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 x $2 = $8. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 x $8 = $16. 

The total cost of popcorn and candy is $8 + $16 = $24. 

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He already spent $24 on popcorn and candy, so he has $150 - $24 = $126 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and Colby already saw 5 movies on a Friday, so he has 0 left for Fridays. He also saw 8 movies on Saturdays, so he has 0 left for Saturdays. 

However, he can see movies on other days. Since he has $126 left, and each ticket costs $7, he can see $126 / $7 = 18 movies on other days."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's add the calories of the mini pastries together:
200 (mini cinnamon rolls) + 150 (mini blueberry muffins) = 350 calories.

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 350."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs on both days. 
So, the total number of Junebugs she removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs she removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's say Peter's age is P, Paul's age is P + 10, and Jean's age is P - 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean).

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3P = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

P = 33.33

Since age can't be a fraction, we can round down to 33 (as age is usually measured in whole years).

The final answer is 33."

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 
60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables."

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance spat = (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the total money made from the Widgeteer 3000 in 30 days is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

The total money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 in 30 days is 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she can get. 

900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

The fixed charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. So, the labor charge is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
The parts charge is $60.

Now, let's add these amounts together: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75.

The final answer is 178.75."
"To find out how much James spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the CDs. 

The CDs cost $15 each, and James bought 10 of them. So, the total cost is 10 x $15 = $150.

However, he got them for 40% off. To find the discount, we need to calculate 40% of $150. 

40% of $150 is 0.4 x $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 x $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 

$90 - $200 is -$110.

So, James was out $110.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount she will get from selling each type of root crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

So, the total time taken is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first find out how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. 
Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 
The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 
So, we need to multiply 70 by 7 and then subtract 40. 
7 * 70 = 490 
490 - 40 = 450 
The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to add the stickers she got and subtract the ones she lost.

She started with 15 stickers.
She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and add them together.

For the New York Times, Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. 
10% of $5 is 0.1 x $5 = $0.50 per copy.
For 6 copies, the commission will be 6 x $0.50 = $3.

For the Wall Street Journal, Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. 
8% of $15 is 0.08 x $15 = $1.20 per copy.
For 10 copies, the commission will be 10 x $1.20 = $12.

Now, we add the commission from both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find Leo's age, we need to know Marcus's age first. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo's age is 2 times Marcus's age. So, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to know how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. 
Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 
Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 
We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 45. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 15. 
So, Dinar scored 15 points. 
Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch. 

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per inch. 

So, we multiply 1.5 inches by 2 pages per inch. 

1.5 * 2 = 3

There are 3 pages in the book."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many 15-minute intervals:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:

60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, we need to find out how long she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to bed at 10 p.m. So, the total time she usually sleeps is 8 hours. 

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

Now, we need to find out how long she was asleep from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. 

5:55 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours 40 minutes 

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 

3 hours 40 minutes + 23 minutes = 3 hours 63 minutes 

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours 15 minutes 

Now, we add 4 hours 15 minutes and 3 hours 63 minutes 

4 hours 15 minutes + 3 hours 63 minutes = 8 hours 18 minutes 

So, Kim slept for 8 hours and 18 minutes that day."
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we need to convert 2 dozen to the number of cups. 

1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups, we multiply 24 by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons. 

2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from 16. 

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons remaining.

Jonathan also has 24 cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the total number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, there are 100 occupied beds.

Now, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 14 days.

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, the total number of patients admitted is:
50 * 14 = 700

Now, we need to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. 
Initially, there were 100 occupied beds. 
700 more patients are admitted, so the total number of occupied beds is:
100 + 700 = 800

Now, we need to find the total number of unoccupied beds. 
The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, and there are 800 occupied beds, so the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Non-work emails = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to her boyfriend. 
   Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, so one-third of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * Non-work emails
   Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * 9
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to know Aliya's age first. Since Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, Shawna's age is 3 x 3 = 9 years.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 x 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is 38.4."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

So, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day. So, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes."
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of Amora, Lainey, and Collins to find the total number of corn chips. 
70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

The supplies cost $400. 
50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200.

The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies cost, so it's $400 + $200 = $600.

The travel cost is $600."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon. 
Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.
Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms: 
x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 
9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9: 
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught: 
Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2. 
Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, we need to multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.
Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

Since the bird flies south for 300 miles and then flies north for 36 miles, the net distance traveled south is 300 - 36 = 264 miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. 
Then, she got 1/2 a dozen (6) from her office party. 
Her friends gave her 4 dozen (48) brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. 
So, the number of brownies left is 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to find the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age. 25% of 8 is 8 x 0.25 = 2. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). To find the total age, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.

The total age of the family members is 30."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

John paid $2100 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10) 
Perimeter = 2 * 25 
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of slats = Perimeter * 2 
Total number of slats = 50 * 2 
Total number of slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister.

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She had 12 boxes initially, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

After giving away 80 oranges, she had 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Then, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 160 is 160 / 4 = 40 oranges.

So, she kept 40 oranges and sold the rest. The rest is 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The answer is 120."

Then, we add 4 to 25. 25 + 4 = 29. 

So, India has 29 states. 

The total number of states in both countries is 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to first calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to know how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can subtract 10 from Robert's cherries to find Richard's cherries. 

Robert has 30 cherries, so Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we can subtract Richard's cherries from Robert's cherries to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. 

Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 20 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 20 = 10 more cherries than Jerry.

- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165

"Let's break down the information given:

- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

From the first statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48 years.

From the second statement, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

Since Emil is currently 19 years old, we can set up an equation to find his dad's current age:

D = 48 - (24 - 19) = 48 - 5 = 43 years.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, his brother's age will be 12 years. So, we can set up another equation to find his brother's current age:

B = 12 - (24 - 19) = 12 - 5 = 7 years.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find out how many servings Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so he caught 3 x 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find out how many servings he has: 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert 1.5 feet to inches. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 1332 - 18 = 1314 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can fit 1314 / 12 = 109.5 plants in the flower bed. However, we can't have half a plant, so we'll round down to 109 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 109 - 17 = 92 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 92 * 6 = $552 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

For 5 hanging baskets, Katherine will need 5 x 3 = 15 petunias. 
The cost of petunias will be 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

For 5 hanging baskets, Katherine will need 5 x 2 = 10 sweet potato vines. 
The cost of sweet potato vines will be 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first find out how much soil they used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

So, they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations.

They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 x $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she sets aside $500 x 12 = $6,000.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside by the cost of each pair of shoes.

$6,000 ÷ $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp. 

She can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 30 shrimp, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes. 

She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 

So, to cook 30 shrimp, it will take her 10 minutes. 

To cook and peel 30 shrimp, it will take her 10 + 5 = 15 minutes. 

To cook and peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. On high, it cools the room 3 degrees an hour. So, it cooled the room 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours. The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour, so it warms up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total cooling effect. The air conditioner cooled the room 6 degrees initially, then cooled it another 12 degrees, and then warmed it up 4 degrees. So, the net cooling effect is 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is 14."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is x. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can say that the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years.

We also know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time. 

So, Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years, we can set up the equation: 
x + 75 = 90

Solving for x, we get:
x = 90 - 75
x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

1. He writes a check every month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
2. He writes a check every month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
3. He writes a check twice per month to the church, so that's 24 checks per year.
4. He writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

The second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 trips. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to first find the length of each wolf's howl. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. 
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the lengths of all three howls. 
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. 
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first find out how much money Adam's parents gave him. 

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12. 

In total, Adam's parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18. 

Adam bought the trousers for $30. So, he had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the average age of the group. 

We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

Let's add their ages: 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract their ages from the total age to find Helene's age: 20 - 7 = 13. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can set up an equation: 

Helene's age = 2 * average age. 

We know Helene's age is 13, so we can set up the equation: 
13 = 2 * average age. 

To find the average age, we divide both sides by 2: 
average age = 13 / 2 = 6.5. 

Now that we know the average age, we can find the total age of the group: 
total age = average age * 4 = 6.5 * 4 = 26. 

We already know the total age is 20, so we can set up another equation: 
20 = total age. 

We know the total age is 26, so we can set up an equation: 
20 = 26. 

This equation is not true, so we need to recheck our previous steps. 

Let's recheck the average age. We know the total age is 20, and there are 4 children. 
average age = total age / number of children = 20 / 4 = 5. 

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age: 
Helene's age = 2 * average age = 2 * 5 = 10. 

We know Helene's age is 10, so we can find the total age of the other children: 
total age of other children = total age - Helene's age = 20 - 10 = 10. 

We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4, so we can find the age of Wilfred: 
Wilfred's age = total age of other children - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age) 
= 10 - (3 + 4) 
= 10 - 7 
= 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out how much money Walter has collected so far. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This means Walter's total amount will be $2000 + $200 = $2200. 

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, and now Walter has $2200, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is 6600."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. 
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies were given to the church, so we divide the total number of cookies by 2.
1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15.
750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

The answer is 50."
"To find out how much each adult gets, we need to know the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets x slices. Then, each adult gets 2x slices.

Since there are 4 kids, the total number of slices for the kids is 4x. The total number of slices for the adults is 2x (for the 2 adults). 

The total number of slices is 4x + 2x = 6x.

Now, we know that the total number of slices is 6x. Since each adult gets 2x slices, each adult gets 2/6x = 1/3 of the total slices.

To find the percentage, we need to divide 1/3 by 6x and multiply by 100. 

(1/3) / 6x = 1/18x. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (1/18x) * 100 = 5.56%.

So, each adult gets approximately 5.56% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his tasks.

He spends 20 minutes per inpatient, and there are 9 inpatients. So, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is 9 x 20 = 180 minutes.

He also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is 10 x 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent on both tasks is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60. 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on tasks from the total time. 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake.

First, let's convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time: 
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 120 minutes to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, the total time needed to make the cake is 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter, then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. 
64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings. 

The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly rental cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost per student is $1.50. There are 10 students, so the weekly cost for the students is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total weekly earnings are the sum of the rental cost and the cost for the students, which is $75 + $15 = $90.

To find the monthly earnings, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4. So, the monthly earnings are $90 * 4 = $360.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $360."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 of 50 is 30. So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. In a year, there are 12 months. 

So, the total number of babies born in a year is 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440.

Now, we need to add the number of babies to the total population. 

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company wants to know how many gallons of water they need, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in 1 cubic foot. 

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10472 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water they need. 

10472 gallons * 5.9 = 61928 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61928 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6192.80

The cost to fill the pool is $6192.80."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to know the number of yellow sticks. We know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11. 

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 x 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 x 10 = 450 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the information given:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water is left in the tank, we need to calculate how much water was pumped in each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, in total, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, in total, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. To find out how much water is left, we subtract this from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The answer is 6000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity each hour.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be:
x - (9% of x) * 5
x - 0.09x * 5
x - 0.45x
0.55x

Now, the power bank starts losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be:
0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
0.55x - 0.1025x
0.4475x

The charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:
x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 x $10,000 = $2,000.

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 x 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings. 

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he has left after buying the fruits he already purchased.

He bought 3 peaches at $.5 each, so 3 x $.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $.75 each, so 4 x $.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $.75 each, so 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, we get $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many pieces Anne gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 x 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs. Each pack has 60 pieces, so she gave away 13 x 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10. 

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price. 
5% of $120 = 0.05 * 120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $126 = 0.05 * 126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * 132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the number of portraits and selfies by multiplying 9 by 2 and 3 respectively.

Portraits: 9 * 2 = 18
Selfies: 9 * 3 = 27

The answer is 18 portraits and 27 selfies."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to divide the total number of pages he read by the number of pages he reads per minute. 

He reads 18 pages and it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. 

First, we find out how many minutes it takes him to read 1 page. 
10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we multiply the number of pages he read by the time it takes to read 1 page. 
18 pages * 3.33 minutes per page = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

First, let's find out how many guests checked in after dinner. Since twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, and 15 people opted for a late checkout, 15 * 2 = 30 people checked in in the afternoon.

Now, we add the 7 people who checked in after dinner to get 30 + 7 = 37 people.

The total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 37 = 67.

Now, we subtract the number of guests who checked out, which is 24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) = 39.

So, the hotel now has 67 - 39 = 28 guests."

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she can answer correctly.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries can answer 75% of the easy questions correctly, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

She can also answer half of the average and difficult questions correctly, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, in total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions correctly.

The final answer is 36."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold. 

Let's say she sold x large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(x * $12) + (2x * $4) = $120

Combine like terms:

12x + 8x = 120

Combine the x terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is 12."

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from cookies. 
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from cupcakes. 
Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

Then, she gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them 2 * $10 = $20. 
Now, we subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found by anyone else.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 60 were found by the Smith twins, so 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

We know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone else, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine in a month.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, one dwarf can mine:
- 12 * 30 = 360 pounds with his bare hands
- 24 * 30 = 720 pounds with an iron pickaxe
- 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds with a steel pickaxe

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with each type of pickaxe:
- 40 dwarves with bare hands: 40 * 360 = 14400 pounds
- 40 dwarves with iron pickaxes: 40 * 720 = 28800 pounds
- 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes: 40 * 1080 = 43200 pounds

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50. 
The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 
So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is 8 * $1.50 = $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first find out how much he still owes for the bedroom set after he sells his old bedroom.

Tom buys the bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, he has $1000 left.

Now, he has to pay 10% of the original price of the bedroom set each month. 10% of $3000 is 0.1 x $3000 = $300.

So, Tom has to pay $300 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the number of red balloons remaining:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons released.

4. Calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   8 blue balloons * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons added.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios.

If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension (100% - 40%). In this case, Marcus will have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus having to turn in homework if the normal teacher comes in is 60% * 50% = 30%.

If the substitute teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she'll give an extension (100% - 40%). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus not having to turn in homework if the substitute teacher comes in is 60% * 50% = 30%.

If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 80% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment (100% - 20%). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus not having to turn in homework if the whole class doesn't get an extension is 80% * 10% = 8%.

Now, we add up the chances of Marcus not having to turn in homework in each scenario: 30% + 30% + 8% = 68%. 

The chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 68% = 32%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first find out how many tickets are left after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, let's subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left for the graduates.

Seats left for graduates = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total expenses and total earnings.

Total expenses = $3 (parking) * 3 days = $9
Total earnings = $15 * 3 days = $45

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings.
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Now, we divide the net earnings by the total hours worked to find out how much Melissa makes per hour.
Total hours worked = 6 hours * 3 days = 18 hours
Jury pay per hour = Net earnings / Total hours worked
Jury pay per hour = $36 / 18
Jury pay per hour = $2

The final answer is $2."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to add the cost of the books and pencils.

The cost of 3 books is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Total amount spent = cost of books + cost of pencils
Total amount spent = 48 + 18
Total amount spent = 66 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the space between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to know how many apples are in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box. Since Uncle Franky has two boxes, he has 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

He wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by 8.

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan is 11 * 2 = $22.
Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella is 6 * 3 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he lost while in school.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and didn't work, so he lost 4 years * $25,000 per year = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned while in school. He got $50,000 per year in loans, so he earned $50,000 * 4 years = $200,000.

To find out how much he earned after graduating, his income tripled, so he earned $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, he earned $75,000 * 4 years = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned after graduating, which is the sum of the money he earned while in school and the money he earned after graduating. $200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000.

To find out how much he still needs to earn to pay off the loans, we subtract the total amount of money he earned after graduating from the total amount of money he lost while in school. $100,000 - $500,000 is not correct, we need to add the money he earned while in school to the money he earned after graduating. $100,000 + $500,000 = $600,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of money he still needs to earn by his new income to find out how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. $600,000 / $75,000 per year = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of the fabric is length times width, so 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2. 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many letters were delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209.

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to first find out how much he won and lost in each race.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. He lost $5, so twice that is $10. $1 more than $10 is $11. So, he won $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11, so 1.5 times $11 is $16.50. He lost $16.50.

Now, we need to add up all the money he lost. He lost $5 in the first race and $16.50 in the third race. $5 + $16.50 is $21.50.

To find the average, we need to divide the total amount he lost by the number of races. There were 3 races. $21.50 / 3 is $7.17.

The average amount he lost that day is $7.17."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to add the amount they grew to their original heights. 

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between their new heights. The difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

Let's say the first person took x dollars. 
The second person took x + 80 dollars.
The third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours the painters worked. 

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the painters worked 3/8 * 7 = 21/8 = 2.625 days.

Now, we need to convert 2.625 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2.625 days is 2.625 * 24 = 63 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked. 63 hours / 4 = 15.75 hours.

The final answer is 15.75."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables. Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls is 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38. 

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Now, subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Finally, divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $4200. So, the car is worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $3322. So, the car is worth $15800 - $3322 = $12578.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12578, which is $2643. So, the car is worth $12578 - $2643 = $9900.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9900."

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, so we need to convert it to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour, so the total cost of the visit is 0.5 * $300 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the parking. The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the total cost of the parking is 2 * $6 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. 
The football team ate 80% of 40 pizzas. 
80% of 40 is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the pizzas eaten by both groups. 
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60. 
Now, let's subtract the pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered. 
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

There are 14 pizzas left."
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 26200 cents is 262 dollars.

The total cost of postage is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   7 - 4 = 3

So, 3 meatball sub sandwiches remained.

3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   3 + 3 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many meatballs were in the 6 sub sandwiches that remained. 
Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs. 
   6 * 4 = 24

The answer is 24."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver fertiliser, we need to find a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to know how many pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. 

Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter for 6 dozen croissants.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every pound of butter, he will pay $2.00 instead of $4.00.

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay 6 * $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. 

However, 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. 

The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21. 

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they had initially. 

Since they each had $60, we can say they had 60 dollars each.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of 60 dollars. 
1/4 of 60 is 15 dollars. So Maggie spent 15 dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of 60 dollars. 
1/3 of 60 is 20 dollars. So Riza spent 20 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money they have left. 
Maggie has 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.
Riza has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.

So, Maggie and Riza have 45 + 40 = 85 dollars left.

85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to know how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. 

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas in a week. 

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we divide 291 by 7. 

291 ÷ 7 = 41.57 

So, the third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas a day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in both puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, he placed 500 more pieces.

In total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

She bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (15 / 12 = 1.25)
Cost of 15 roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost of roses from the money she has.

$5 - $18.75 = -$13.75

Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. However, we can calculate how much change she would have if she had enough money.

Change = $5 - $18.75 = -$13.75

Since she can't have a negative amount of change, we need to find out how much she needs to pay. 

$18.75 - $5 = $13.75

Now, we need to find out how many quarters she needs to pay. 

$13.75 / $0.25 = 55 quarters

Since she can't have a fraction of a quarter, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

55 quarters"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total amount from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total amount from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the amounts together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves the station in 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival. The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives in 145 minutes. So, Paul will wait 145 - 10 = 135 minutes for his train."
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves each week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves each week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to divide the price Mr. Rogers bought it for by 0.75 (since he bought it at 75% of the original price). 

Original price = 2000 / 0.75 = 2666.67

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got. 

Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the price he bought it for is 1.2 times the price Mr. Rogers bought it for. 

Price Mr. Rogers bought it for = 2000
Price Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for = 1.2 * 2000 = 2400

The discount Mr. Rogers' friend got is the difference between the original price and the price he bought it for. 

Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for
= 2666.67 - 2400
= 266.67

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= (266.67 / 2666.67) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours, we need to first find out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. 

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds in 1 hour). 

In 4 hours, it creates 4 * 60 = 240 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs, they create 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is 1200."
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 x 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we add 15 to 180.

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is 195."
"To find the time it took James to reach the store, we need to first find the total distance he walked. 

He walked half the distance to the store and then half the distance back. 
So, the total distance is 2 times the distance to the store. 
The distance to the store is 4 miles, so the total distance is 2 x 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we can find the time it took him to walk 8 miles at 4 miles per hour. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

The time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas and the cost of buying 10 bananas individually.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas. Each bunch costs $3.00, so 10 bunches will cost 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 10 bananas will cost 10 x $0.80 = $8.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying 10 bananas individually from the cost of buying 10 bunches. $30.00 - $8.00 = $22.00.

Jenny saved $22.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total amount: 
100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to multiply the number of inches it grows in 4 years by 3.25 (13 years / 4 years).

8 inches * 3.25 = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

We know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes in total, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 15% of 300 bikes is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting the other two from the total. So, 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. The prices are as follows: MTB is $500, BMX is half of MTB which is $250, and Trekking is $450.

To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them together.

For MTB: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
For BMX: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
For Trekking: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Adding these together, we get $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is 131,250."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. 
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

He also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday. 
1/16 of his weekly minutes are spent on these days. 
There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly minutes are 7 * 60 = 420 minutes. 
1/16 of 420 minutes is 420 / 16 = 26.25 minutes. 
So, he spends 26.25 minutes on Saturday and Sunday. 
Total minutes spent on classes and extra learning time per week = 200 + 26.25 = 226.25 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 
226.25 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The final answer is 3.75."
"To find the height the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The ball is initially dropped from the third floor, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet high.

On the first bounce, it bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, so it goes up to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it bounces to 2/3 of the height it reached on the first bounce, so it goes up to 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is 32."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. 
   Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 
   6 feet = 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
   So, the second child's height = 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   So, the third child's height = 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
   So, the fourth child's height = 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's say the velociraptors ate x kilograms. Then, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, which is x/2. 

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, we can set up the equation: x = (x/2) + 270. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: 2x = x + 540. 

Then, we subtract x from both sides: x = 540. 

So, the velociraptors ate 540 kilograms. 

Now, we know the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms. 

The original amount of meat on the triceratops is 270 + 540 = 810 kilograms.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of them is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of them is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost will be 12 x 12 = $144."
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans left and the total number of cans.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then, her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Ellen's friend can get sprayed from the 2 shaken sodas. There are a total of 12 sodas, and Ellen's friend can take any one of them. 

The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans. 

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans) 
= 2 / 12 
= 1/6

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it's traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first find out how many days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31. 

20% of 31 is 0.2 x 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

Billy is available to help 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the total number of people in the buses and the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since there were only 2 people (Mary and John) inside the church, we subtract them from the total number of people outside the church to find the number of people inside the church:

"To find the total time for lunches and breaks, we need to add the time for lunches and breaks.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 
First, we add the time for lunch and break: 30 + 15 = 45 minutes per day.

Since there are 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5: 45 * 5 = 225 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 225 / 60 = 3.75 hours.

The total time for lunches and breaks is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on her credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The discount is $4.00, so the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the towels:
10% of $30.00 is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
The discount is $3.00, so the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items:
$15.00 (returned item) - $15.00 (initial cost) = $0.00 (no change)
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

She initially charged $85.00, so the new balance is:
$85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00
$70.00 + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of small jellyfish is also x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and these are the large jellyfish that change color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary. 

20% of $100,000 is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Since Lauren lives on 40% of her salary, she saves 60% of her salary. 

60% of $100,000 is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Now, we need to find out how much Lauren needs for retirement. Since she wants to save for 20 years, we multiply the amount she saves each year by 20.

$60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we need to find out how many years she needs to work to save $1,200,000.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. 
40% = 40 / 100 = 0.4

Now, we can divide the number of boys by the decimal to find the total number of students.
240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to know the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.
600 - 240 = 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money my mom spent, I need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon amount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the soil is $26.
The total cost is $19 + $26 = $45.
The coupon is $7 off, so I need to subtract that from the total cost.
$45 - $7 = $38.

My mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the total number of heels.

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

Now, we add the total height of both types of heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 heels in total (3 of 4 inches and 3 of 2 inches). 

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. She will hike 125 miles twice a day. 

To find out how many miles she hikes in a day, we need to multiply 125 miles by 2. 
125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, we need to divide the total miles by the number of days to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time. 
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

So, Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate a quarter of 12 kg for Pierre and 1/3 of 12 kg for Paul.

A quarter of 12 kg is 12 / 4 = 3 kg. 
1/3 of 12 kg is 12 / 3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre gets 3 kg and Paul gets 4 kg. 

Now, let's add the kilograms that Pierre and Paul have together: 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The total kilograms of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques have is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also has $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total money spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

The answer is 5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's count the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is: 16 - 11 = 5"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time they all took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is 560."
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we need to divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 20 / 10 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight. Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
2. Since Kris got half of the stickers from Luis, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
3. Luis gave half of his stickers to Seth. Since Luis had 32 stickers, he gave 32 / 2 = 16 stickers to Seth.
4. So, Seth had 16 stickers in the end.

"To find out how many M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag. 

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply the total ounces by 30.

30 ounces * 30 M&M's = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 10 M&M's in each bag. 

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the earth by the distance Alfie flies each day.

Half the way around the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide 20,000 by 400 (the distance Alfie flies each day) to find out how many days it will take.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the way around the earth.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car goes 750 mph."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since they painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Since the total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, Arnold and Madeline must have painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8. 
200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box. 
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds. 
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The final answer is 120."
"Valerie's brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so he earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month. 

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. 

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

First, we know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, let's call the time she spends on the sidewalk 'x'. We can set up an equation to find 'x'. 

The time she spends on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time she spends on the sidewalk is 'x'. The distance she walks on the beach is 2 miles, and the distance she walks on the sidewalk is 1 mile. 

We know that time = distance / speed. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 times her speed on the beach. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
40 = 2 / 2 * 1 / 2 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
40 = 1 / 2 

This is not correct. We need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk. 

Let's try again. 

Let's say her speed on the beach is 's'. Then her speed on the sidewalk is 2s. 

The time she spends on the beach is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation: 
40 = 2 / s 

We can solve for 's': 
s = 2 / 40 
s = 1 / 20 

Now we know her speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute. 

The time she spends on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (2 * 1/20) = 10 minutes. 

So, the total time she spends on the walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has saved so far. 

She saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 x 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings.
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to save $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add all the blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has now. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Now, we need to find out how many marbles he has now. To do this, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 60 - 24 = 36. 

So, Bob has 36 marbles now. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water Donny has in the second mug. 

Donny has 2 mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. So, the second mug has 1 ounce of water.

Now, Donny can drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the second mug is at least 40 degrees. 

Since the second mug has 1 ounce of water, we can set up an equation to find the temperature of the second mug. Let's say the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

We know that 1 ounce of the 33-degree water is mixed with 1 ounce of the x-degree water. The average temperature of the mixture is 40 degrees. 

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / (4 + 1) = 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 40 * 5

132 + x = 200

x = 200 - 132

x = 68

So, the second mug is at least 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in three weeks there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. So, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell pays. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. 
There are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell bought 4 packs. 
Total bagels = 9 * 4 = 36 bagels

Cost per bagel = Final amount / Total bagels 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 3 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops that is, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know that 3 scoops require 3 potatoes. To find out how many potatoes 18 scoops require, we need to divide 18 by 3.

18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in both periods: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide 240 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs: 240 / 12 = 20.

84 / 14 = 6

Since the ratio of women is 9, we multiply 9 by 6 to find the number of women on the bus initially. 
9 * 6 = 54

Now, 20 women alight from the bus. To find the number of women who have remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

He earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he did this for 3 days. So, he earned 3 x $56 = $168 from the bouquets. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we divide $168 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold. $168 / $8 = 21 bouquets.

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, 21 bouquets have 21 x 12 = 252 sunflowers.

Faraday also earned $26 from the sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2, we divide $26 by $2 to find out how many sunflowers he sold. $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 days, so he eats 5 x 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

Now, let's add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30

Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since it's 60% longer than the first song, we multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

The first song is 5 minutes, so the second song is 5 * 1.6 = 8 minutes. 

Now, we add the length of both songs together: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

Last Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, he spent 2 x $20 = $40.

He sold each device for twice the price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, he sold 2 devices for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the devices is 2 x $40 = $80.

The profit from Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Last Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, he spent 4 x $20 = $80.

He sold each device for $40. So, he sold 4 devices for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the devices is 4 x $40 = $160.

The profit from Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to find Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to multiply 2300 by 20% (or 0.2).

2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce. We know that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. 

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs, we subtract the number of bottles needed from the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

4200 - 460 = 3740

So, Hortex needs to produce 3740 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to know the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies, the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of purple babies wearing bows and blue babies wearing bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The probability is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 or 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907 + 1907 = 3814

Now, let's subtract this number from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday: 5168 - 3814 = 1354

So, the IRS received 1354 reports on Wednesday.

"Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He then sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. He has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left. 

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60. 

Abraham initially sold 40 square meters for $50 and 20 square meters for $30. So, he earned 50 + 30 = $80. 

In total, Abraham earned 80 + 60 = $140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13. 

Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, so we subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in one day. 

He changes his face mask 2 times a day, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in one day.

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. We can multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by all of them: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So the last complex has 240 + 400 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know John collects garbage from 3 complexes, and he collects 3 times a week. So, he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week.

The total number of apartments he collects garbage from is 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1440 * 0.40 = $576 per week.

The final answer is 576."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 17150 = 119950 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 119950 = 839650 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (119950 + 200) = 10 * 120150 = 1201500 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 120150 = 2403000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 2450 + 17150 + 119950 + 839650 + 1201500 + 0 + 2403000 = 10, 1201500

1/5 of $100 is $20. 

So, Jack had $100 initially. Now he has $100 + $20 = $120."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y, the blue rope is B, and the red rope is R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: R = 4(Y - 7).

We know that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write another equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Now we can substitute the expressions for B and R into this equation: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 28 = 37.

Add 28 to both sides: 6Y = 65.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 10.83.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 10.83 - 7 = 3.83.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(3.83) = 15.32.

The length of the red rope is 15.32 centimeters.

15.32"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Ronnie and Rissa had initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie had $5, Rissa had 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she had 4/5 of her money left. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

1/5 of $15 is 15/5 = $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Now, Rissa had $15 - $3 = $12 left.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, her sister must have $3. 

Ronnie had $5 and gave $3 to her sister, so Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to know the total amount of paint used for each color. We know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the other three colors. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the total amount of paint used for the other half by 3. 

12 / 2 = 6 pints for the other half. 
6 / 3 = 2 pints for each of the other colors. 

Since there are 2 pints of each of the other colors, and we know that half the mural is yellow, we can multiply the amount of the other colors by 2 to find the total amount of the other colors. 

2 * 2 = 4 pints of red, white, and purple paint. 

The total amount of paint used for the other colors is 4 pints. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can subtract 4 from 12 to find the amount of yellow paint. 

12 - 4 = 8 pints of yellow paint. 

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the other three colors. We already know that the other half is 6 pints. 

8 pints of yellow paint is half the mural, so the other half must be 8 pints. 

Since we know that the other half is 8 pints, we can multiply the amount of the other colors by 2 to find the total amount of the other colors. 

2 * 8 = 16 pints of red, white, and purple paint. 

Since we know that the other half is 8 pints, we can subtract 8 from 12 to find the amount of red paint. 

12 - 8 = 4 pints of red paint.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

First, we find the area of one bedroom: 
20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is: 
4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is: 
5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the rooms together: 
960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Let's break it down. Alice counted 3 clouds on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counted 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counted 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counted 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counted 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up all the clouds she counted: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods it has. 

The regular box has 100 pods, and the new box has 20% more pods. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with 120 pods for $1. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with 120 pods. 

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide 1 by the cost of one pod. The cost of one pod is $12/100 = $0.12. 

So, you can run 1 / 0.12 = 8.33 cycles for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas starts with $1000. He loses 10 bills, so he has $1000 - $10 = $990.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of $990 is $495. So, he has $990 - $495 = $495 left.

Then, he triples his money. Tripling $495 gives him $495 * 3 = $1485.

Now, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To do this, we divide $1485 by $5. $1485 ÷ $5 = 297.

So, Thomas has 297 five-dollar bills."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves. 
Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals."
"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He used 45% of it on Monday, so he used 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches of chalk. Since he can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk.

Now, he has 2.75 inches of chalk left. He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days he has left, we need to divide the remaining chalk by 20% or 0.2.

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75

Since you can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days.

The teacher has 13 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100.

The final answer is 5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This means that Wendy's current age is 5 times Colin's age 7 years from now. 

So, we can write an equation: W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that Colin's age 25 years from now is 1/3 of Wendy's current age. 

So, we can write another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them by substituting the first equation into the second one.

W = 5(C + 7)
W = 5C + 35

Now, substitute W in the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find out how many bags he needs. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate. 

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
So, each friend ate 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 6 * 10 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 
To find out how many slices of each pizza Kate needs, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices in each pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

She needs 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas in total."

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many snowballs he can build in a certain amount of time, considering the ones that melt.

First, let's calculate how many snowballs he can build in an hour. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 1 hour (60 minutes), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs will melt.

Now, let's calculate how many snowballs he will have after 1 hour. He can build 20 snowballs, but 8 melt. So, he will have 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

Since he wants 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many more snowballs he needs to build. He needs 60 - 12 = 48 more snowballs.

Now, let's calculate how many hours it will take him to build 48 snowballs. He can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. So, to build 48 snowballs, he will need 48 / 20 = 2.4 hours.

Since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take him 3 hours to build 60 snowballs.

It will take Jay 3 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to go back 20 years from John's current age. 

John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can divide John's age 20 years ago by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago. 

8 / 2 = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. 

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of bandages they started with is x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 84 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19.

The answer is 19."
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to subtract the length of her hair from the original length. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.

Since the haircut costs $30 per inch, we multiply the length of the haircut by the cost per inch. 
2 * 30 = 60

The cost of the color is $40. 
The total cost is 60 + 40 = 100

The final answer is 100."

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood a shark has. 

40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply the amount of blood a shark has by 10.

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The answer is 1200."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. 40 more people entered at 10:00, so the total is 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. An additional 3 times as many people as the first group came in, which is 3 * 40 = 120 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (later) + 120 (evening) = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

He bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

75"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. 
So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 
50% of $60 is $30. 
So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. 
He buys 10 bottles of scotch, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted: 50 + 90 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to subtract the amount that was consumed each day.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Now, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 4 people to find out how much each person got. 5 ÷ 4 = 1.25 gallons.

The answer is 1.25."
"To find the number of coffee mugs, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs is 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22. 

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she had initially and then subtract the colors she used.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so she lost 4 colors. 

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

180"
"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to first find out how many shells team Alphas and team The finders found.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells. 
40% of 700 is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells.
700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
60% of 420 is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to add up the weights of all the tunas he caught. 

First, we add the weights: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram: 128 * 0.50 = $64.

The answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

She bought the magazines at $72 and sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

First, we need to find 11/8 of $72. 
11/8 * 72 = (11 * 9) = 99

So, Trinity sells the magazines at $99. 

Now, we can find her profit by subtracting the cost from the selling price. 
Profit = Selling price - Cost 
Profit = 99 - 72 
Profit = 27 

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. 
So, in 3 days, it removes 3 * 1 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.
In 3 days, it removes 3 * 2 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.
In 5 days, it removes 5 * 4 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the water removed at each setting: 
3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we need to find the total number of balloons. There are 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. 

10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

Now, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To find out how many mL of the second medicine Saanvi needs for 8 doses, we first need to find out how much of the second medicine she needs for one dose. 

Since she needs 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find out how many mL of the second medicine she needs for 8 doses. We multiply 42 mL by 8. 

42 * 8 = 336 mL.

The final answer is 336."
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to find the capacity of one of his classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * 120 = 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities. 

Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150

The final answer is 150."
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. So, the interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay back is the original $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he already paid from the total amount he needs to pay back. So, $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to know how many diapers are changed in total per day. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan also changes half of the diapers. 

So, Jordan changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar first. 

The volume of a square base is length * width * height. 
So, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans get 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans. 
So, the total number of jelly beans is 540 / 0.8 = 675.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans. 
So, the number of red jelly beans is 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

Since we can't have half a jelly bean, we round down to 202 red jelly beans.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was 900 - 202 = 698 jelly beans off."
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at each station.

At the first station, 40 people entered the bus. 
At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered the bus. 
3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.

Now, the total number of people on the bus is 20 (initial) + 40 (first station) + 30 (second station) = 90.

At the third station, the number of people on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is 5 x $2 = $10.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 x 1.5) = $5. So, the total cost for 3 years is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years: $10 + $15 = $25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups can be made. 

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, we divide 10 by 8 to find out how many groups can be made. 

10 ÷ 8 = 1.25

Since we can't make a fraction of a group, we can make 1 group of 8 students. 

Now, we need to find out how many groups can be made in total. There are 3 grades (4-7), and 10 students in each grade. 

3 x 10 = 30

So, there are 30 students. We can make 1 group of 8 students. 

30 ÷ 8 = 3.75

Since we can't make a fraction of a group, we can make 3 groups of 8 students. 

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for each group to try the escape room. Each group has 45 minutes. 

3 groups x 45 minutes = 135 minutes

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5. 

First, we need to find the length of the shorter piece. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combine like terms: 5x = 40.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how much ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he wants 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find out how many pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The answer is 10."
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

5 windows * 35 inches = 175 inches

So, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first. 

The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. If Karen gets both, she gets a 20% discount. 

First, we need to find 20% of the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. 
20% of $35 is 0.2 x $35 = $7. 
20% of $40 is 0.2 x $40 = $8. 
The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. 
$35 + $40 = $75. 
$75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, we need to add the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and she has 10 fingers. 
The cost of nail art is $3 per nail. 
10 x $3 = $30. 

The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90."

"To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he is traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = speed x time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr x 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance covered. 

Percentage = (distance covered / total distance) x 100

3. The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used for the pies is 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.
5. Since the total grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, and we know that 48 grapes were used for the pies, the remaining grapes must be 84 - 48 = 36 grapes.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and the middle shelf can hold 10 books. So, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we know that the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, the middle shelf can hold 10 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. 

Let's add the number of books each shelf can hold: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books.

Elly has 110 books, and the shelves can hold 45 books. To find out how many shelves she needs, we need to divide 110 by 45. 

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Elly needs 3 shelves to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many eggs Rose bought, we need to know that one dozen is 12 eggs. So, five dozens of eggs will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose bought 60 eggs for $2.40. She will sell each egg for $1. So, she will sell 60 eggs for 60 * $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. So, the profit will be $60 - $2.40 = $57.60.

The final answer is 57.60."
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats. Half of 100 hats are red, so 100 / 2 = 50 hats are red.

2. Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats. 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats. 3/5 * 50 = 30 hats.

4. The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats. 50 - 30 = 20 hats.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 
She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. 
The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. 
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how many blueberry cubes Mary makes, we need to first find out how many strawberry cubes she makes. 

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. 

We can write this as an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. 

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is 96."
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played each year by the points she scored in each game, and then add those results together.

She played 40 games each year for 4 years. 
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

She scored 21 points in each game.
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

So, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left. Then he found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. After picking up a bead that wasn't a marble, he got rid of it, so he was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of candle and the number of flashlights.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 
4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, there are 4 flashlights.

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights. 
Total candles = 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.
Total flashlights = 4.

So, Brianna's family is using 36 candles and 4 flashlights when the lights go out."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. 110 ÷ 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

So, it takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to know the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows: 
20 helmets / 2 = 10 robots

Now, we know there are 10 robots and 20 helmets. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows: 
20 helmets / 2 = 10 footballs

Now, we know there are 10 robots, 20 helmets, and 10 footballs. To find the total number of items, we add these together: 
10 robots + 20 helmets + 10 footballs = 40 items

The total number of items Dominick saw is 40."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the number of hours he works by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 6 x 60 = 360 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call, which is 15 minutes. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5.

24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is 120."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we need to first find out how long it would take with the old varnish. 

Since it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes for 6 paintings with the old varnish.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes for 6 paintings with the new varnish.

To find out how much longer it will take, we subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water for each group of plants and add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water. 
4 plants * 0.5 cups = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. 
8 plants * 1 cup = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the rest of the plants. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. 
20 - 12 = 8 plants

Since these 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, 
8 plants * 0.25 cups = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants. 
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the land part and the water part separately.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes for him to cover 100 yards on land is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes for him to cover 100 yards in water is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time on land and the time in water, which is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

The answer is 14."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to know the cost of the main phone and the cost of each additional phone. 

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are 4 additional phones. So, the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones. So, the total cost is $20 + $40 = $60."
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to know how many days are in June. June has 30 days. 

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day. Since 1 dozen is 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

If he sells all the doughnuts, he will sell 120 doughnuts per day. Since he sells each doughnut for $2, he makes 120 * 2 = $240 per day.

In 30 days, Derrick will make 30 * 240 = $7200."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 words per minute.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, we know the number of people on the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days left in the week (5 days).

60 * 5 = 300

Now, we add the number of people on the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week.

50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 360

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. That's 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 4 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 4/6 * 6 = 4 lemons for the regular lemonade. 

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons for the extra gallon. 

In total, Tim needs 4 + 2 = 6 lemons."
"To find out how much dog food they need in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of food they need per day and then multiply it by 7.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. 
3 German Shepherds consume 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food per day.
2 Bulldogs consume 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food per day.

So, the total amount of dog food they need per day is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of dog food per day by 7 to get the total amount of dog food they need in a week: 
21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals.

2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 2-legged animals have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.
4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 4-legged animals have 15 x 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs: 80 / 2 = 40.

Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial price = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial price = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time she spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week. 

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates 210 * 4 = 840 minutes and practices yoga 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time she spent on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric, we need to calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

101"
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to first find out how many seeds are in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. 50% of 36 is 0.5 * 36 = 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we need to add the seeds of both sunflowers. 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

90"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

So, Timothy has 54 pens. Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. 
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"". 
Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

So, before summer, Jackie was 70""."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 

The discount on each T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. 

So, the price of each T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. 

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $4 = $8.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount. 

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.

So, the price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends. 

$8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he has 6 * 3 = $18.

He spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he spent 1.25 * 4 = $5.

Now he has 18 - 5 = $13 left.

Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we need to divide 13 by 6.5. 

13 / 6.5 = 2.

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items they bought.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. 
So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. 
So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

Now, we need to add up the amount Ellen and Lani spent. 
$105 + $230 = $335.

They spent $335 in total."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the cost of making 10 jars and then subtract that from the total amount of money Tim makes from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of making 10 jars:

- 2 pounds of passion fruit per jar: 10 jars * 2 pounds = 20 pounds
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit per jar: 10 jars * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds
- 2 pounds of honey per jar: 10 jars * 2 pounds = 20 pounds

Now, let's calculate the cost of each ingredient:
- Passion fruit: 20 pounds * $6 per pound = $120
- Jackfruit: 15 pounds * $8 per pound = $120
- Honey: 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $200

Total cost of making 10 jars: $120 + $120 + $200 = $440

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim makes from selling 10 jars:
- 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total amount of money made - Total cost of making 10 jars
- Profit = $500 - $440
- Profit = $60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x 25 = 800 cents.
A dime is worth 10 cents, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x 10 = 950 cents.
A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x 5 = 600 cents.
A penny is worth 1 cent, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x 1 = 750 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 3100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 3100 ÷ 100 = 31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is 31 dollars."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up the money she spent and subtract it from the money her parents gave her.

First, let's add up the money she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: 2 x $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total money spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the money her parents gave her:
$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. That means he is open 5 days a week. 

If he services 3 cars a day, then in a week he services 3 * 5 = 15 cars. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, in 2 weeks he services 15 * 2 = 30 cars. 

He gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks he makes 30 * 4 = $120."
"Let's count the cookies Randy has now.

Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
- Sugar: 4 (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
- Oatmeal: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

10 + 7 + 6 = 23"
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount he would get from selling half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

First, we need to find out how many toys he has in each half. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, he will have 6 toys in each half.

For the half with 6 toys at $5 per toy, the total amount he would get is 6 * 5 = 30 dollars.

For the half with 6 toys at $7 per toy, the total amount he would get is 6 * 7 = 42 dollars.

Now, we add the amounts from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn: 30 + 42 = 72 dollars.

72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes Nate's dog dug while Nate was on vacation. 

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. 
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Then, Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day. 
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7. 
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The answer is 4."
"To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average.

To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

In total, Igor gathered 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items.

However, he placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.

Since Igor gathered 7 beakers, he must have lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws he needs for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, he needs 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he needs 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

He has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws he needs from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs, we need to add the eggs in both baskets. 

The first basket has 10 eggs. 
The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add up the money each girl raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Now, let's add up the money each girl raised: $430 + $750 + $700 = $1880.

The total amount of money they all raised is $1880."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. 

Since Aaron ran 1 mile in 16 minutes, and he ran half the distance that Vanessa did, we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run 1 mile. 

If Aaron ran 1 mile in 16 minutes, then Vanessa ran 4 miles in 4 times as long, which is 4 x 16 = 64 minutes. 

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. 

64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the total length of line required for the dock. 

Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract that from the total.

600 - 6 = 594

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount they make in a day and then multiply it by 2.

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. 

The cost of meals is 2 x $5 = $10. Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make in a day is 6 x $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make in a week is 2 x $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons. 

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find 25% of the total cost. 

25% of $80 is 0.25 x $80 = $20. 

So, the total selling price of all the watermelons is $80 + $20 = $100. 

To find the price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons. 

$100 ÷ 50 = $2. 

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old James is now. 

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. 

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person peels in an hour. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels: 20 - 15 = 5.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price. 
80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320. 

Now, we need to add the cost of the labor. 
3 hours x $50 per hour = $150. 

The total cost is $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs of each type of animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation: 
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation: 
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.
