"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

Janet sells each egg for $2, so she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as follows: 
2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fibers together: 
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The total number of bolts needed is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

First, we need to find 150% of $80,000. 
150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Now, we add this to the original price to get the new value of the house.
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

The cost of the repairs was $50,000. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the new value of the house.
$200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000

The profit Josh made is $150,000."
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

James runs 60 meters per sprint. He runs 3 sprints per week. 

Total meters per week = 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, she needs to give them the remaining amount for the third meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + x

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken per meal, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now we can set up an equation to find the total feed needed for the day:
800 cups + x = 800 cups + 60 cups
x = 60 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial download and the restart.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 160 GB (80% of 200 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute:

Time = Total GB / Download Rate
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, 20 minutes are spent on the restart. So, the total time spent on the initial download is:

Time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Time = 100 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. Since the download rate remains the same, the time it takes to download the remaining 40 GB is:

Time = Total GB / Download Rate
Time = 40 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 20 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time spent on the initial download and the time spent on the second download:

Total Time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes
Total Time = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled. Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since John is trying to get home, we need to find the distance from his current location to home. We know he drove 180 miles initially, then 15 miles, and then 160 miles. So, the distance from his current location to home is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

However, since he is trying to get home, we need to subtract the distance he drove from his initial location. Distance from home = 355 - 180 = 175 miles.

The final answer is: 175"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to calculate the number of overtime hours first:
45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so:
1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50/year

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this means that in the first year, Carlos will incur a loss. We need to continue calculating the net profit for subsequent years until we reach a positive net profit.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners.

Now, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

(1/3)x = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Future value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Future value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,125) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day (westward) and the distance covered by each train on the second day (northward).

Since both trains travel for 80 miles westward, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by each train on the second day. 

So, the total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered by each train in the two days:

Distance covered by each train on the first day: 80 miles
Distance covered by each train on the second day: 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train in the two days: 80 + 150 = 230 miles

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week
$700 per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000 per year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week
$450 per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500 per year

Now, let her total annual salary:
$35,000 per year (teaching) + $22,500 per year (coaching) = $57,500 per year

"To find the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats per day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs per day, she eats 3 * 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

84 / 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance covered so far. Marissa has covered 4 miles and 2 miles, for a total of 6 miles.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to cover the entire distance.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the required speed for the remaining distance:

Required speed = Total distance - Distance covered so far
= 12 miles - 6 miles
= 6 miles

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
= 6 miles / 1 hour
= 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

Initially, the orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the orange drink becomes 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 17/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 49/3 liters."
"To find the age of Raymond's son, we need to first find Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of the son, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of the son's birth from his current age:

Age of the son = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at the time of the son's birth
Age of the son = 25 - 23
Age of the son = 2

Since we want to find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from the current year. However, the current year is not provided. Assuming the current year is the same as Samantha's age (31), we can calculate the years that have passed since the son's birth:

Years since the son's birth = Current year - Age of the son
Years since the son's birth = 31 - 2
Years since the son's birth = 29

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total length of the candle that melts, we need to calculate the number of hours the candle burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop.

Distance between first and second stops = Distance traveled after the second stop - Distance traveled before the second stop
= 45 - 20
= 25

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be written as:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine the costs of the heels:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides to isolate B:
99 + 5 = B
104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then find the average of those numbers.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours spent per week.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins (x = 40), we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

Number of gold coins = x + 30
= 40 + 30
= 70

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

We are given that Raymond has 40 jewels, so R = 40.

We are also given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. This can be written as:
A = (1/2)R + 5
Substituting R = 40 into this equation, we get:
A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, we are given that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. This can be written as:
S = A - 2
Substituting A = 25 into this equation, we get:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
= 4 + (0.25 * 4)
= 4 + 1
= 5

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

After buying 8 video games for $20 each, he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the amount he spent on video games is $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Since he spent $30 on video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he had initially. We know he sold 13 sets for $195, and he had $30 initially. 

The number of Lego sets he had initially is $195 / $15 = 13.

However, this is the number of sets he sold. To find the number of sets he still has, we need to subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets. 

So, he still has 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets."
"To find John's average speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day, and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days. 

Total hours run in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Since he runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed per hour as follows:

Total distance run in a week = 60 miles
Total hours run in a week = 6 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total hours
= 60 miles / 6 hours
= 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 times her skipping speed. 

So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the total time she spends on each activity. 

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance she travels by adding the distance covered while running and walking.

Distance covered while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance covered while walking = Speed * Time = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from Polly where she can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. 

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's reach is 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon when holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories you can still consume in a day. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find out how many servings you can have left by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight: 0.8 * 300 = 240g.

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks * Cost per pound
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (1 + 2/5) = 5 * (7/5) = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial Post-it notes - Post-it notes used at work = Post-it notes remaining

80 - 220 = 23

However, this equation doesn't make sense because Candice couldn't have used more Post-it notes than she initially had. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes and used some at the store. Let's say she used x Post-it notes at the store. Then, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

The total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used at the store and the ones she used at work, plus the ones she had remaining:

80 = x + 220 + 23

Now, we can solve for x:

80 = x + 243

Subtract 243 from both sides:

-163 = x

Since we can't have a negative number of Post-it notes, this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the situation again.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes and used some at the store. Let's say she used x Post-it notes at the store. Then, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

The total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used at the store and the ones she had remaining:

80 = x + 23

Subtract 23 from both sides:

57 = x

So, Candice used 57 Post-it notes at the store.

Now, we can find the total number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased:

Total Post-it notes = Post-it notes used at the store + Post-it notes used at work
= 57 + 220
= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4. 

Occupied units = 120 * (3/4) = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
= 120 - 90
= 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes Tom to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the day with higher revenue is Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as follows:

Patchy's kittens = 3 * Trixie's kittens
Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we can find the total number of kittens by adding the adopted kittens (7) to the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie:

Total kittens = Adopted kittens + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 7 + 36 + 12
Total kittens = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is 14."

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: 

1. The first 20 years, she receives the full annual pension of $50,000.
2. The remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the value of the pension per year.

First, let's calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years:
20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the annual pension for the remaining 10 years:
5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

Since this is the annual increase, we add it to the previous annual pension:
$50,000 (previous pension) + $50,000 (new pension) = $100,000

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the full amount and subtract it from the full amount.
10% of $140 is 0.1 * 140 = $14
So, the amount charged for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126
Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons). 

12 gallons (tank capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining in the tank

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

We can set up a proportion to find the miles per gallon: 
100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = x miles ÷ 3 gallons

Cross-multiplying, we get:
100 * 3 = 4x
300 = 4x
x = 300 / 4
x = 75

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 teams/school * 4 schools = 8 teams.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 players/team * 8 teams = 40 players.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 coach/team * 8 teams = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the total number of teams, players, and coaches to find the total number of people sent by the schools. 

Total number of people = 8 teams + 40 players + 8 coaches = 56 people.

56"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone and then add them together.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add the number of each type of gemstone together: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there were 595 gems in the chest."
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Weekly allowance: $5

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. 

She teaches 5 classes per weekday, and there are 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. 

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 

So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15.00 per student, her total earnings in a week are 495 * $15.00 = $7,475.00.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

The interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

Since there are 3 months, the total interest will be 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Shiela will pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $9 = $759.

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3: $759 / 3 = $253.

The final answer is: $253"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left in the first year is 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does:

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. 
Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as:
4x = 400

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 400 / 4
x = 100

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Comparing the costs, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

Original cost = $100
Discount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how much water was left, we first need to calculate how much water the two girls got together. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total water they got is 2 * 4 liters = 8 liters.

Now, we need to subtract the water the boy got from the total. 

24 liters - 8 liters (water the girls got) - 6 liters (water the boy got) = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

So, there are 10 liters of water left."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2. 

Grace's weight: 125 pounds
4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, let's add their weights together: 
Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds

The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene started vacationing at 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them together.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will actually need, we need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - (1/4 * Total number of invited guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags by multiplying the number of guests who will attend by the cost of each gift bag.

Total cost = Number of guests who will attend * Cost per gift bag

The final answer is 24."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.
The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, we can use this as a reference point.

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Then, Lee's time would be 'x - 2'. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 38

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 38 + 2
x = 40

So, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is his original time minus the improvement:

40 - 4 = 36 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds with his improved diet."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she started with. Since she lost half of the volume, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume. 

Let's denote the original volume of tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of it, the equation would be: 32 = x / 2.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we divide the total ounces by 16 to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Now, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. We know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. We also know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit, which is 30 - 5 = 25.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time watched on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3. 

Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can find the average by adding their roll-ups and dividing by 2.

Average roll-ups eaten: (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore.

First, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can find the rate of water intake per second.

Rate of water intake per second = 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/foot
Rate of water intake per second = 0.2 liters/foot * 20 feet / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second

Now, we need to find the total time it takes Julia to reach the shore. We know that the shore is 64 seconds away, but Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the total time, we can set up a proportion:

Time taken to row 20 feet = 16 seconds
Time taken to row 64 feet = x seconds
(20 feet / 16 seconds) = (64 feet / x seconds)
x = (64 feet * 16 seconds) / 20 feet
x = 32 seconds

Now that we know the total time, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total amount of water taken on = Rate of water intake per second * Total time
= 0.25 liters/second * 32 seconds
= 8 liters

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants per day (2) by the number of days (15) and then subtract the number of flowers that did not grow (5).

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo as 'x'. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 
6 * Brittany's phone capacity = 1800
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can set up another equation: 
Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x
300 = 50 * x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total selling price is 10 * $15 + 5 * $24 = $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide this by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons per part.

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by the value of one part: 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years ago and Lylah's salary four years ago, then calculate their salaries four years later.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years later, we can calculate his salary four years later as follows:

Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know that Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years ago. We can set up an equation to find Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years later + 40%
$52,000 = Lylah's salary four years later + 0.4 * Lylah's salary four years ago

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

$52,000 = Lylah's salary four years later + 0.4 * $40,000
$52,000 = Lylah's salary four years later + $16,000
Lylah's salary four years later = $52,000 - $16,000
Lylah's salary four years later = $36,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
= $52,000 + $36,000
= $88,000

The final answer is: $88,000"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Now, multiply the total sheets used per week by 4:

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = (1/3) * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters stamped from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped
= 30 - 20
= 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then, she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. 

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons. 

She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons. 

We are given that she had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2.

x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

Total time spent on all patients per day = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200/patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients per day - Total cost of doctors' time per day

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to set up equations. Let's denote the number of worker bees as W, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of queens as Q.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation:

W = 2B

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation:

B = 2Q

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:

W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

3B + Q = 700

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700

Expand and simplify:

6Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees by substituting Q into the second equation:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees by substituting B into the first equation:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

Now, two times as many bees as initially left (30) leave the hive in the next 6 hours, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

However, only the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return in the next 6 hours. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees are left that haven't returned yet.

So, in the next 6 hours, 15 bees return.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between Charlie and Dorothy's Facebook friends.

Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as 'x'. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write an equation: 
Charlie's friends = 3x
We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can write:
3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4 (since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy):
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same unit as the speed. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, he will be waiting for Tim. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial amount of fries in the pack must be 47 (remaining) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the weekly hours by 16 to get the total hours for the semester:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Adding these together, we get:
144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total length of all the baked goods together:
100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly requirement and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly requirement is the sum of the bananas needed by the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. 

Monkeys: 200 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly requirement: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly requirement by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"To determine the total distance each person ran, we need to calculate the distance Blake ran and the distance Kelly ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice. So, the total distance Blake ran is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance from the 40-yard line to the 100-yard line is 60 yards (100 - 40 = 60). Since she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 60 yards twice. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 60 yards * 34 = 2040 yards.

Now, we can compare the distances. Blake ran 200 yards, and Kelly ran 2040 yards. Since 2040 is greater than 200, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2040 - 200 = 840 yards.

The winner ran 840 yards farther than the loser."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding from the total number of tadpoles initially, and then add the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add 6 to 11: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24
Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, let's calculate the price after 2 months: 
Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Now, let's calculate the price after 4 months: 
Original price = $24
Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see that the price is increasing by 20% every 2 months. To find the price after 36 months, we can calculate the number of 2-month periods: 36 / 2 = 18 periods.

Now, let's calculate the price after 36 months: 
Price after 36 months = $28.80 * (1 + 0.20)^18
Price after 36 months ≈ $28.80 * 3.207135472 = $92.19

The final answer is: $92.19"
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first find the value of each type of toy.

We know that one action figure costs $5. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

We also know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, one red car costs $4.

Now, we can find the total value of all the toys:

- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

Total value of all toys: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. If she loses $35/hour by doing her taxes herself, and she would have done 3 fewer hours of freelance work, we need to know how many hours she would have worked. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. 

Let's denote the number of hours she would have worked as 'x'. Then, the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself is $35x.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in income is the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself minus the cost of hiring the accountant: $35x - $90.

However, without knowing the number of hours she would have worked, we cannot calculate the exact difference in income."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

The final answer is: €97"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get the required eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2 to it.

Ethel has $8, so twice that amount is 2 * 8 = 16.

Adding $2 to that amount, we get 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

"To find the total miles walked in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles each day on weekdays, so the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

Weekends: There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) in a week. Pancho walks 10 miles each day on weekends, so the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

Total miles walked in a week = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends
= 100 + 20
= 120 miles

The final answer is 120."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of spider legs is 80 * 8 = 640.

Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 640 (spider legs) + 540 (insect legs) + 30 (invertebrate legs) = 1210.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to add the minimum payments for all debts and then add 50% of that amount.

Minimum monthly payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

50% of $1000 is $500. Adding this to the minimum payments: $1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start by calculating the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up the equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10x - (Cost of lemons + Cost of sugar) = $25

We know the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, but we don't know the cost of lemons. Let's call the cost of lemons 'L'. The total cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is L + $2.

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

$10x - (L + $2) = $25

Since they made $25 in profit, we can assume they made x gallons of lemonade. The total revenue is $10x.

We also know that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. So, the total cost of lemons is $3x.

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

$10x - ($3x + $2) = $25

Combine like terms:

$7x - $2 = $25

Add $2 to both sides:

$7x = $27

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 3.86 (round to 2 decimal places)

Now that we know they made approximately 3.86 gallons of lemonade, we can calculate the total cost of lemons:

Total cost of lemons = $3x
= $3 * 3.86
= $11.58

The final answer is: $11.58"
"To find the number of Chinese girls, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese. 

So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. 

To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants. 

Number of Chinese girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of Chinese boys

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. 
   1/4 of 6000 is (1/4) * 6000 = 1500.

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. 
   1/3 of 6000 is (1/3) * 6000 = 2000.

3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses: 
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500.

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity: 
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. 
   Half of 2500 is (1/2) * 2500 = 1250.

5. Calculate the remaining amount after charity donation: 
   2500 - 1250 = 1250.

6. Calculate the total amount spent on daughter and wife: 
   Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. 
   Total amount spent on daughter and wife is 200 + 700 = 900.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add the number of crabs each person has to find the total: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks to find the total amount he earned:
$50 + $80 = $130

The total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks is $130."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

The winner got 3/4 of the votes, so we need to find 1/4 of the total votes to determine the number of votes the loser got.

1/4 of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20.

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the loser got 1/4 of the votes, which is 20 votes.

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, and the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: E = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2, and half Jan's age two years ago was J/2 - 2. So, we can write another equation: M - 2 = (J/2) - 2 + 5.

We are given that Jan is 30 years old, so we can substitute J = 30 into the second equation: M - 2 = (30/2) - 2 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: M - 2 = 15 - 2 + 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = 18.

Adding 2 to both sides, we get: M = 20.

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation: E = M + 2, so E = 20 + 2, which simplifies to E = 22.

Therefore, Jean is 22 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since there are 4 members in the team.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time taken by the less well-rounded team. 

The first runner takes 60 seconds. 
The second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was greater than 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) + P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/2 + 1/2
= 1

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) = 1

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1.

The difference in probability is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(3/4) * 100 = 75%

Therefore, Jerry is 75% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 75%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Then, the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18x = 90 and solve for 'x'. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we get x = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month, then multiply it by 3 since the payment is made after 3 months.

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Total interest for 3 months = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost. The cost of the bags is $20x, and the transportation cost is $2x. So, the total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

Number of peaches collected per minute = 2
Number of minutes = 3

Total peaches collected = Number of peaches collected per minute * Number of minutes
Total peaches collected = 2 * 3
Total peaches collected = 6

The total number of peaches John collects is 6."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount: 3.5 pounds
Days in a week: 7

Insects needed per day = Weekly amount / Days in a week
Insects needed per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects needed per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the initial number of trees: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees that Tom chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has prepared: $20 - $10 = $10.

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40
Carrots per restaurant = 2 pounds

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total amount of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
Carrots not used = Total amount available - Total amount distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

Step 2: In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had. 
   Initial cards = 20
   Cards collected in the first month = 3 * 20 = 60
   Total cards after the first month = 20 + 60 = 80

Step 3: In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   Cards collected in the second month = 60 - 20 = 40
   Total cards after the second month = 80 + 40 = 120

Step 4: In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   Combined cards in the first and second months = 60 + 40 = 100
   Cards collected in the third month = 2 * 100 = 200
   Total cards after the third month = 120 + 200 = 320

The total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total earnings = (Weekly salary * Number of weeks) + Monetary reward
Total earnings = ($2100 * 52) + $5000
Total earnings = $109,800 + $5000
Total earnings = $110,800

The final answer is: $110,800"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

The total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in the bags she bought and add it to the pens she already had.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the bags she bought:

- Blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 pens
- Red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 pens

Now, let's add the pens she already had to the pens in the bags:

22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after six tests. 

The total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 558 - (358 - 71) = 558 - 287 = 271.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 271 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total distance Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
Distance = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week
Total distance in the first period = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
Distance = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week
Total distance in the second period = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The total distance Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. 

The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 3 plates. 

So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by 240 cups.

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is $70."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and then subtract the amount she already has saved.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + $20 (shoes) = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so we subtract that from the total cost: $50 - $10 = $40.

Since Sara earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to find out how many sessions she needs to earn $40.

Let's divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5): $40 ÷ $5 = 8.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Let's divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing session ($4): $40 ÷ $4 = 10.

Since Sara earns more per babysitting session, we should consider the babysitting sessions first. She needs 8 babysitting sessions to earn $40. 

However, since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, we need to find the next whole number of sessions that will give her at least $40. 

Let's calculate how much she earns per session: $5 (babysitting) + $4 (mowing) = $9 per session.

Now, let's divide the amount she needs ($40) by the total amount she earns per session ($9): $40 ÷ $9 = 4.44.

Since we can't have a fraction of a session, we round up to the next whole number. Sara needs 5 sessions to earn at least $40.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 5 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, and we know that red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, we can plug in the values: 
P = 2(1.5 + 6) 
P = 2(7.5) 
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:
Time = Distance / Speed 
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour 
Time = 5 hours 

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first day. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 

On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first day, the second day, and the third day. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms: 3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides: 3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3: x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round down to 133 customers on the first day.

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day: 133 + 50 = 183.

The number of customers on the third day is 500 - (133 + 183) = 184.

The final answer is 184."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. Similarly, the amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is also 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. The current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool had 2x gallons initially and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 
4 (roses) + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 

Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The time taken to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.
The time taken to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is half of the time taken by bus, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the time taken for each leg: 
6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards after James loses 8 and buys 14.

Initial water type cards: 40
Cards lost: 8
Cards bought: 14
New water type cards: 40 - 8 + 14 = 46

Total cards: 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 46 (water) = 96

Now, we can find the probability of picking a water type card:
Probability = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
Probability = (46 / 96) * 100
Probability ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 48%.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add the cost of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

Base burrito: $6.50
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
Sauces (2): $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
Upgrade: $3.00
Total cost of food: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle:

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home initially.

Now, let's find the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took 36. 

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were harvested.

Now, let's find the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after the two weeks.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees separately.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collected 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins are involved in the activities that are not sunbathing. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

So, the total number of penguins involved in these activities is 12 + 12 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of penguins involved in these activities from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 portions and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

Total slices required = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Now, we divide the total slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of pizzas needed:

Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many full pens Ram can make from the 25 pens. Since he can make one full pen from 5 empty pens, we can divide 25 by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means Ram can make 5 full pens from the 25 pens. However, this doesn't account for the 5 empty pens that he already had. So, we need to add those to the 5 full pens to find the total number of pens Ram has.

5 (full pens) + 5 (empty pens) = 10 pens

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 10 pens.

"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, so we need to multiply the total amount by 3. 
   $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to first find the ages of Mary and Joan.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A: 
   30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
   700 - 420 = 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up the equation: 
John's candies = 2 * Robert's candies
We know John has 54 candies, so we can substitute that in: 
54 = 2 * Robert's candies
To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides by 2: 
Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 (since James has 6 more candies than Robert): 
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 
John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33 = 21

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and responds to.

He receives 2 letters per week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, he spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours per week writing."
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x. After Ginger gave him some fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for the movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid = Total cost before discount - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Tuesday by 2. 
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can find the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister.
Difference in cookies = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the difference in calories by multiplying the difference in cookies by 200.
Difference in calories = 28 * 200 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 * 20 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:

Girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Girls in the first class + Girls in the second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:

Boys in the third class = Total number of boys - (Boys in the first class + Boys in the second class)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 36 wolves today, and 15 cougars the previous night and 12 cougars today.

Total number of wolves = 10 + 36 = 46
Total number of cougars = 15 + 12 = 27

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is 84."
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the new cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 * 20 = 400.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall will get 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls is 400 (initial cows) + 2 * 20 (new cows) = 400 + 40 = 440.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the total number of cows in 20 stalls by 8/20, which is the same as dividing by 5/2. 

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 440 / (5/2) = 440 * 2 / 5 = 176.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to find the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate into it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds. To do this, we multiply 8000 by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

So, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation to find Jamal's apples: 

Let x be Jamal's apples
Andrea's apples = x + 8
52 = x + 8
x = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has:
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300.

Two thirds of 9,300 is calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $0.62."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms.

To find the total number of windows in the additional windows not connected to bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 windows in the additional windows = 20 windows.

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's find out how many lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, and the song has 54 lines, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

Next, we need to find out how many lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from both scenes to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize. 36 (from the first scene) + 48 (from the second scene) = 84 lines.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9 cards, which have the letter D.

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

Therefore, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * 15 = $180.

The final answer is $180."
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining space is used by the sterling silver beads. 

To find the length occupied by the silver beads, subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the length occupied by the silver beads by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and then add them together.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, we add the stories from both weeks for each child:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60 stories
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120 stories
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180 stories

To find the total number of stories, we add the stories from all three children:
60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories

The total number of stories written altogether is 360."

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

First, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to first determine the total time Susan worked. 

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she paused for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the working time to minutes. 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings: 150 minutes / 10 minutes * $5 = 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike: 21 > 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim: 18 < 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony: 42 > 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim: 18

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100."
"To calculate the total miles driven per year, we need to calculate the miles driven per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a year.

Miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles (to and from work) = 60 miles
Miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000
Bonus per month = $150
Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and her sales number this year is 45, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year as 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the first year and the current year is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since we know the number of books sold in the first year (90) and the current year (45), we can find the number of books sold in the second year as 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold (65) by the price per book ($20). 

Total amount of money earned in the second year = 65 * 20 = 1300 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss.

Weekly weight loss of Joey = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss of Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss of Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can divide the total weight lost by Sandy's weekly weight loss.

Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = Total weight lost / Sandy's weekly weight loss
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 4 weeks

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $700 + $500 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will have $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for gifts.

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that P = (1/2)P_now, where P_now is the current population of Chile. We can set up the equation:

P = (1/2)P_now

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)P_now

We can also substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)(2P_now)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(N - 6) = P_now

Now we can substitute the expression for N from the first equation:

3000((1/2)(C - 6) + 6) = P_now

Substituting C = 46, we get:

3000((1/2)(46 - 6) + 6) = P_now

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(20 + 6) = P_now

3000(26) = P_now

96000 = P_now

The current population of Chile is 96000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who couldn't come: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we add the number of people who couldn't come to the number of people who came: 16 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (new marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

Cost = V * 0.1
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children. 

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since we know the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Since the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we need to add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils. Since we don't know the number of pencils in each box, let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is (3x + 2) + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
(3x + 2) + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 2 + 46 = 26
3x + 48 = 26
3x = 26 - 48
3x = -22
x = -22/3

Since the number of pencils in a box cannot be negative, this equation doesn't have a valid solution. However, we can try to find a different approach.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. We can divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes Jam has (3) to find the average number of pencils per box. 

72 / 3 = 24

Since Jam has 3 boxes, we can assume that each box has 24 pencils. 

Now, we can find the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils:
Jam's pencils: 3 boxes * 24 pencils/box = 72 pencils
Meg's pencils: 46 pencils
Total pencils: 72 + 46 = 118 pencils

To find the total number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the average number of pencils per box:
118 / 24 = 4.92

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes needed to achieve this cooling effect. 

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling effect / Cooling effect per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

Total weakening effect of ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening effect per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will directly weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Total weakening effect of cream = 15 milliliters

The total weakening effect of the iced coffee is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening effect = Total weakening effect of ice cubes + Total weakening effect of cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Let's assume the number of old records brought by the 5 people is x. 

Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained by the 5 people is 5 times the number of new records they can get from their old records. 

So, the total number of new records is 5 * (x/2) = 5x/2.

We are given that the total number of new records obtained is 7. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5x/2 = 7.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 14.

Then, we divide both sides by 5: x = 14/5.

x = 2.8.

So, the 5 people brought in 2.8 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate the salary of a senior programmer as follows:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $224000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224000."
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop, and then add the number of people who got on at the first stop.

Let's break it down:

- At the first stop, 5 people got on.
- At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the net change is 8 - 7 = 1 person.
- The total number of people heading to the third stop is 20.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal:

Initial number of people on the bus = Total number of people heading to the third stop - Net change at the second stop
= 20 - 1
= 19

So, 19 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in Oscar's lollipop count step by step.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: 2 * 14 = 28, so he buys 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 lollipops that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

Oscar now has 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we add the lollipops Erin initially had to the ones her mother gave her: 7 + 10 = 17.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, and they spent $80, they received $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they got a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

Next, the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from coupon) = $12.

Now, let's subtract the total discount from the original amount they spent: $80 - $12 = $68.

Therefore, the customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:

0.30 * total time = 15 hours

To find the total time, we can divide both sides by 0.30:

total time = 15 / 0.30
total time = 50 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 

$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the cost per person includes the cost of one round of mini-golf ($5) and 2 go-kart rides ($20). 

Cost per person = $5 + $20 = $25

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find the number of friends Morgan can invite: 

$60 / $25 = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs and had $2 left. This means he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy he bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

1.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes 3 trips a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services every 20 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Total distance = Distance to friend's house + Detour distance + Distance back home
Total distance = 200 miles + 10 miles + 240 miles
Total distance = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time taken to reach friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to reach friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time taken to reach friend's house = 2.86 hours

Time taken for detour = Distance / Speed
Time taken for detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for detour = 0.14 hours

Time taken to return home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to return home = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time taken to return home = 3 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to reach friend's house + Time taken for detour + Time taken to return home
Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken = 5.99 hours

The trip took 5.99 hours."
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87 - 43 (number of girls) = 44."
"To find the number of boys, we need to multiply the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

To find the total number of kids, we need to add the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18"
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points = 42
Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33

Minimum points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. 

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifters: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find Erin's initial score, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Erin's initial score as E and Sara's initial score as S. 

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so E = 14. We also know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, so E = 3S. 

Now we can substitute E = 14 into the equation E = 3S, which gives us 14 = 3S. 

To find S, we divide both sides by 3, which gives us S = 14/3 = 4.67. 

However, since we are dealing with whole points, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't score a fraction of a point. 

So, Sara's initial score is 4. Erin's initial score is 14."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a 20% additional cost, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 frames = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 1/4 = 11 seniors.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Total cost for senior gifts = $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost for Ethan will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of his time. However, since the question does not provide the time cost, we will assume it is negligible or not provided.

Total cost = Materials cost = $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50 pairs.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add the hours she practiced on each day.

She practiced 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 

The hours she practiced on Saturdays are twice as long as Tuesday's night class, so she practiced 2 * 1 = 2 hours on Saturdays.

Now, let's add the hours: 
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces were returned, the cost of the faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The cost of the functioning pieces is the total cost minus the cost of the faulty pieces, which is $400,000 - 0.4x.

However, we also need to find the total number of functioning pieces. Since 40% were faulty, 60% of the total number of pieces are functioning. So, the number of functioning pieces is 0.6x.

The cost of the functioning pieces can also be expressed as 0.6x.

Now, we can set up an equation: 0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x.

Solving for x, we get:
0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000
1x = 400,000
x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the cost of the functioning pieces:
Cost of functioning pieces = 0.6x = 0.6 * 400,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since a dozen is 12, and she fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks separately. 

Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks would be 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15."

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

M = 3650[0.008333(1+0.008333)^5]/[(1+0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.008333)^5]/[(1.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.043383)]/(1.043383 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.008667]/0.043383

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, we add the total amount of silver and gold they have together: 
50 (Axel's silver) + 100 (Anna's silver) = 150 silver pesos
80 (Axel's gold) + 120 (Anna's gold) = 200 gold pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we divide the total profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is $2."
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5x hectares. The amount he has left is 12.8 hectares, which is 2/5 of the original amount (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

We can set up the equation:

2/5x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the initial number of female members, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing initially is the number of female members (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the number of people who can't make it is 14, and the number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15.

"To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."

"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent editing from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 6 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 6 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.25 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 25%

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first find out how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12 in this case. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we can add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

So, Jenny gave away 7 slices of pizza. 

Initially, there were 12 slices. After giving away 7 slices, there are 12 - 7 = 5 slices left. 

Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, the total number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to cover the cost.

However, if we consider the context of the question, it seems like Mark wants to know how many days he needs to work to earn the remaining amount. 

$300 (bike cost) - $50 (initial amount) = $250 (remaining amount)

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the remaining amount by his daily earnings:

$250 (remaining amount) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to work for 25 days to earn the remaining amount and buy the bike.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total ounces = 2 * 8 = 16
Total calories = 16 * 3 = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks in a year and then multiply that by the number of working days per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 4 weeks every month, the total number of weeks worked in a year is 52 * 4 = 208 weeks.

Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is 208 * 6 = 1248 days.

The builder gets paid $50 per day, so his total earnings for the year would be 1248 * 50 = $62,400.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours)

Now, we calculate the energy used in 30 days: 
7.2 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Next, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Now, we calculate the new energy usage for 30 days: 
2.7 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 
216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours = 135 kilowatt-hours

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, the total number of stripes is 34 + 36 = 70. 
The zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Now, adding the stripes of all zebras, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 3. 
88 / 3 = 29.33. 

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we need 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches. 

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Let's denote the number of cannolis as C. Then, the number of corns is 2C.

We are given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis. So, C = 40.

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

We are also given that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. The total number of cannolis is 100, and the total number of corns is 60. 

The combined total is 100 + 60 = 160.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is 4,000."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate
Time taken to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time taken to read the book = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. So, 10 employees left, and 30 employees remained.

The remaining 30 employees worked for 40 hours each, and the company paid them $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Now, we add the total amount paid in May and June to find the total amount paid in the two months:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two events: the candle exploding and the candle smelling like wet dog. 

Let's assume that the events are independent, meaning the occurrence of one does not affect the other. 

The probability of a candle exploding is 1% (since it's 99% guaranteed not to explode). 
The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5%.

We can use the formula for the probability of two independent events occurring together: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

P(A and B) = 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

This means that 0.5% of the candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the total number of candles by the probability:

Number of candles = 50000 * 0.0005 = 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the regular price of the blouses.

First, we need to find the discount amount. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses:

Total cost = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

So, the total cost of the 4 blouses is $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into variables and equations.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

From the problem, we know:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.
2. Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact amount yet.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so T' = 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.
5. Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so S' = 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.
6. The sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, so T + S + A + T' + S' = 500.

Now, we can substitute the known values into the equation:

30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine the constants:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 6 days:
Total distance = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to this total.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 km every day for 7 days:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the second week to the total distance:
Total distance = 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size since it's half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the introductory deal, the normal rate, and the increased rate.

1. The introductory deal lasted for 6 months, which is 0.5 years. The cost for this period is 0.5 * $8 = $4.

2. The normal rate lasted for 8 months, which is 0.67 years. The cost for this period is 0.67 * $12 = $8.04.

3. The increased rate lasted for 8 months, which is 0.67 years. The cost for this period is 0.67 * $14 = $9.38.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. 

Since the tattered jeans cost $6 more than the jogger jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, but the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is not directly relevant to the problem.

Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash, and he plans to use this money to buy a ticket to the amusement park, we can set up an equation to find the total amount of money he has from selling the cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny starts with as 'x'. He sells the cards for $1.5 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x.

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The amount of money he gets from selling 2/3 of the cards is 2/3 * 1.5x = 1x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100, which is the sum of the money he gets from selling the cards and the $50 he already has. So, we can set up the equation:

1x + 50 = 100

Subtracting 50 from both sides gives us:

1x = 50

Dividing both sides by 1 gives us:

x = 50

So, Kenny starts with 50 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

36 guests * 2 hotdogs per guest = 72 hotdogs

However, since the caterer only prepared for half of the guests, we need to divide the total number of hotdogs by 2:

72 hotdogs / 2 = 36 hotdogs

Now, we know that 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

40 guests - 36 hotdogs = 4 guests

Therefore, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. We know he spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. So, 99% of 500 cents is 0.99 * 500 = 495 cents.

Now, we know that George spent 495 cents on chips and candy bars. We also know that the candy bars cost 75 cents each. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars (495 - 120 = 375 cents) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents).

375 / 75 = 5

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti and Juris to the 6 friends, which makes 8 people in total.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 8. 

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, divide the total oranges by 8: 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person.

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.
Antoine needs 2 * 2 pounds of onions, so the total cost of onions is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.
The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.
The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 9 = 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The sisters have 42 more beads than the other."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven:
The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus spends 3 hours baking, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window:
The window cools down the house by 2 degrees every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the temperature decrease due to the window from the temperature increase due to the oven:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs first. 

The horse runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. To convert 30 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 30 / 60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance: 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and a bail is 2 bushels, the horse eats 1 bushel of hay. 

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 1 * $3 = $3.

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to compare his score after his turn to Marcy's score.

Joey's initial score: 214 points
Joey's score after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240 points
Marcy's score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we subtract Marcy's final score from Joey's final score to find the difference:
240 - 235 = 5

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the price of a regular movie ticket as 'x' and the price of a regular popcorn as 'y'. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 + $3 = $4. 

So, the equation becomes: x + 4 = 20 + 2

Simplifying the equation: x + 4 = 22

Subtracting 4 from both sides: x = 18

Now, we know the price of the regular movie ticket is $18. 

The cost of the popcorn and soda together is $4. Since the soda costs $3, the price of the popcorn is $4 - $3 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. 

Initially, the cost of filling one balloon was $900 / 20 = $45. 

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase: 
$65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the two times:
Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200. 

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $1200 (rubies) = $5200.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35%"
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of 12-pound carrots, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of 75-pound hay, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of 65-pound oats, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the items together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck: 3400 / 2250 = 1.51.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
= 10 + (0.6 * 10)
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) = 350.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, we can find the number of students by dividing the remaining cards by 10. 

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30.

3. Calculate the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils
4. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year: 1/3 of 240 pencils = (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet as follows:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x. The number of students without desktop computers is given as 20. 

We can set up the equation as follows:

(3/4)x + 20 = x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

3x + 80 = 4x

Now, we can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation:

80 = x

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (7 days).

First, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Now, we can divide the total time in hours by the number of days:

4 hours / 7 days = 0.57 hours per day

To convert the result back to minutes, we can multiply by 60:

0.57 hours * 60 = 34.2 minutes

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.2 minutes per day for 7 days to break in the new shoes."
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15. However, since 3 kids are allergic to both, we need to subtract this overlap to avoid double-counting: 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class: 32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to something) = 20.

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

Number of groups = 3
Number of employees in each group = 200
Number of tour guides = 7

Total number of employees = 3 * 200 = 600
Total number of tour guides = 7

Total number of people going on the tour = 600 (employees) + 7 (tour guides) = 607

The final answer is 607."
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and then add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to get the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of their individual weights. 

Combined weight = weight of 1959 penny + weight of 2010 penny
= 48 grains + 36 grains
= 84 grains

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract it from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is $200, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have earned from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

$26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3, since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. 

Gabriel has 20 songs, so Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the maximum capacity of the player. 

100 (maximum capacity) - 60 (Luri's songs) = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of oranges picked, which is 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

So, Stetson gave up $24.

"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = $240 - $20 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

Total miles run per week = miles run per day * days run per week
Total miles run per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles run per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours run per week by dividing the total miles run per week by his speed:
Total hours run per week = Total miles run per week / speed
Total hours run per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours run per week = 6 hours/week

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds * 2 meals = 10 pounds.

Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption for all horses is 10 pounds * 4 horses = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 pounds * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of oats are required to meet this amount. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians. 

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate the number of Pomeranians as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we can calculate:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the highest temperatures: 
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Now, let's divide by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money needed to buy the toy car."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Total number of eggs = 64
Total capacity of trays = 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place = Total number of eggs - Total capacity of trays
= 64 - 48
= 16

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza = $8
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and there's a buy one get one free deal, the cost of 2 packs will be the cost of 1 pack. 

The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

However, there's a $2.00 coupon available. 

So, the total cost of 2 packs after the coupon will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor. 

$2.00 / 8 = $0.25

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls, each standing on top of the 4 girls below. Since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, the height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"" + 60"" = 252"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls, each standing on top of the 3 girls below. The height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 252"" + 128"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

The height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"To find the total minutes Charisma has walked, we need to calculate the number of times she gets up and walks in 5 days. 

Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, she walks 24 times in 5 days. 

Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, we multiply the number of times she walks (24) by the duration of each walk (5 minutes):

24 * 5 = 120 minutes

Charisma has walked for 120 minutes in 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. 

Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we can set up the equation:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). 

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards. 
Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by both: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The total yards of yarn used is 273."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and then add them together.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep. So, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in both locations is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot (x), we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$64 - $32 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

There are 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes in the fight is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375 punches.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Kelsie made. 

We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 1/4 * 36 = 9 cookies.

We also know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, Kelsie made 2 * 9 = 18 cookies.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the amount of money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving his sister half of the money is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time taken by Rob from hours to minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. 

So, we need to find double the time taken by Rob, which is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Now, we add 40 minutes to this, which gives us 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and then multiply each item by the number of skeins required.

There are 3 grandchildren, and each needs 5 items (hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks). So, the total number of items is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:
- Hats: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins
- Scarves: 15 x 4 = 60 skeins
- Sweaters: 15 x 12 = 180 skeins
- Mittens: 15 x 1 = 15 skeins
- Socks: 15 x 2 = 30 skeins

Now, add up the total number of skeins needed: 30 + 60 + 180 + 15 + 30 = 255 skeins

Martha will need 255 skeins of wool."
"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 

So far, Chris has completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, Chris completed 13 problems on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of problems completed: 48 (Monday and Tuesday) + 13 (Wednesday) = 61 problems.

Chris has 100 - 61 = 39 problems left to complete on Thursday."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked, and then add the number of loaves returned.

First, subtract the number of loaves sold: 
200 (total loaves) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) = 68

Then, add the number of loaves returned: 
68 + 6 = 74

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller number of rows. In this case, the blue tulips will limit the number of rows to 3.

The total number of rows will be 3.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies. 

First, we need to convert the fraction 3/4 into a decimal or a mixed number to make the division easier. 

3/4 can be converted to a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75

Now, we divide the total number of raisins (27) by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies (0.75):

27 ÷ 0.75 = 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The answer is: 36"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Original weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time required as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3(22) = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we need to first find out how much he spent on the headphone set. 

We know that Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent: 
$48 - $4 = $44

This means Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. 

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

To do this, we'll divide the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of a single CD: 
$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks - 2 weeks with 5 hours). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 + 40 = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on the bus. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.
Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 + 7 = 66

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
2(x + 5) - 5 = x + 10

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 10 - 5 = x + 10
2x + 5 = x + 10

Subtracting x from both sides:
x + 5 = 10

Subtracting 5 from both sides:
x = 5

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. 
In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 2 * 5 + 5 = 15 years old.
So, Jame's cousin's current age is 15 - 8 = 7 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 5 - 7 = -2 years."
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 

We know the computer costs $1,100. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 

300 / 10 = 30

The girls brought 30 seashells each."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as N and the number of candies George had initially as G. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

So, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed to make: 72
Vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month."
"To calculate the total amount you need to pay, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you will end up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. The first half of the month has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

The total savings for the first half of the month is 15x, and the total savings for the second half of the month is 15(2x) = 30x.

Since Elvis's monthly target is $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2(25) = $50 per day in the second half.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find the total cost of the items Verna bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of five oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of six peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first. 

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is $6."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

4x = 4 * 20
4x = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the 52 letters from the first two steps. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2

The total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

Commission for sales up to $1000: 
30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Additional commission for sales over $1000: 
10% of $1500 ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150 = $450

The total amount earned by Antonella is $450."
"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time for 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time for 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time for 3 miles on a cold day from the time for 3 miles on a hot day to find the difference: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25

"To find out how much coffee Juan drinks, we need to first determine how much coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended amount. 

The difference is 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun's position relative to the ground after 10 hours. 

Initially, the angle between the sun and the ground is 32 degrees. The sun is moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 5 * 10 = 50 degrees upward. 

Since the sun started at the tip of the pyramid, we need to add the initial angle to the angle it has moved. 

The new angle of the sun relative to the ground will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is 82."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles needed by 5. 

12 (older son's candles) + 8 (younger son's candles) = 20 candles. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she spent reading in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages

Now, we know that in the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we simply add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can use the information given. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A, the number of goals scored by Mark as M, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R. 

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: 
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
R = A + 45

Since we know Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute M = 60 into the second equation:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = A + M + R
Total goals = 35 + 60 + 80
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter had $70. After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he had $70 - $20 = $50 left. Then, after spending $6 on plastic action figures, he had $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Since each wooden action figure costs $5 and each plastic action figure costs $2, we can calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought as $20 / $5 = 4, and the number of plastic action figures he bought as $44 / $2 = 22.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4 (wooden) + 22 (plastic) = 26.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly requirement by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to first find the total number of birds he saw over the week.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds, so that's 50 + 50 = 100 birds.
On day three, he saw none, so that's 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds, so that's 120 + 120 = 240 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add up the total number of birds: 100 + 0 + 240 + 20 + 90 = 450 birds.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature for the recipe. 

The recipe calls for 520 degrees. To find the correct temperature, we add 4% of 520 to 520: 
520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees.

"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by adding 30 minutes to 60 minutes, resulting in 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by adding 5 minutes to 120 minutes (2 hours * 60 minutes), resulting in 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. 

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00. 

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, the cost of one pair of contacts is $180.00 / 45 days = $4.00 per pair."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.
John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.
Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

R = 0.99B

We are also given that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' friends, the number of friends she invited, and the number of spouses.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each invited person said they will invite 2 friends, so the number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex invited 10 friends, and each of them will bring their spouse, so the number of spouses is 10 * 1 = 10.

Now, we need to add up all the people: 
- Alex (1) + invited people (100) + friends of invited people (200) + friends of Alex (10) + spouses of friends (10) = 321

So, Alex will need 321 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On the third day, the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window (20 feet). Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown. 

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the crown, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount he needs by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert all the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 2: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 3: 
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 2 * 12 = 24 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 24 + 5 = 29 games.

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 17 (Year 2) + 29 (Year 3) = 63 games.

The final answer is 63."
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time taken to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of this amount, which is 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds."
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract it from his original amount of money.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

Total expenses = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it rotates 725 * 2 = 1450 times per mile. 

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tire rotates 1450 * 400 = 580,000 times per month.

To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12. 
580,000 * 12 = 6,960,000 rotations per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 
To do this, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year. 
10,440,000 / 6,960,000 = 1.5 years.

The tire will need to be replaced in 1.5 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is 1200."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The discount is 30% of the total price of the items. The total price of the items is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60. 

The discount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 * $60 = $18. 

The total cost of the outfit after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42. 

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is a common rate in many places), the sales tax is 0.08 * $42 = $3.36. 

The total cost of the outfit including sales tax is $42 + $3.36 = $45.36. 

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $45.36 = $4.64 left after the purchase."
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to a total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5, for the 7th month it's $100,000 * 1.5 * 1.5, and so on.

The funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
The funding for the 7th month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
The funding for the 8th month is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
The funding for the 9th month is $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
The funding for the 10th month is $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights.

Total functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces he chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Next, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Now, let's add the initial 20 pieces of gum to the total number of pieces chewed: 20 + 4 + 2 = 26.

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he has left, we need to divide the total number of pieces by 2: 26 / 2 = 13.

So, Jim has 13 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet

Now, subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year

Now, divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, and R = T - 9.

Substituting S = 16 into the equation for T, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting T = 19 into the equation for R, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding S, T, and R: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as follows:

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'L'. 

Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up the equation: 
20 = L + 3

Now, we can solve for L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of one apple by 5. 

Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of one orange by 5.

Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * 3
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

His new monthly salary will be his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

The first website publishes 20 articles per day, and the second website publishes 10 articles per day. 

Total articles per day = 20 (political) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is:

Total articles in February = 30 articles per day * 28 days = 840 articles

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time to dig the well = 6 hours + 16 hours = 22 hours

For himself, he needs 2 cupcakes.
For his teacher, he needs 2 cupcakes.
For his 25 classmates, he needs 25 * 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Adding these together, we get: 2 (for himself) + 2 (for his teacher) + 50 (for his classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can write the equation as follows:

x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms:

20000 + 2000 = 70x - x
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69:

x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45

Since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to 319.

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial number of likes, the 2000 likes received in the first week, and the 20000 new likes:

319 + 2000 + 20000 = 22319

The total number of likes is 22319."
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 * $30 = $600

Now, we calculate the 10% discount:
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60

The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and we got a negative number, it means that Sheila paid more than Clara. The correct answer is the absolute value of the difference:

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400 and were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 1/2 * G
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, to find the total sales in the first month, we add the sales of red and green hats:
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200 = 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in both months:
Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900 = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is 2."

"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the monthly rent and the monthly fuel cost: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year, we get: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. 

Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation:

s + g = 20

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

4s + 2g = 70

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

2s + g = 35

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 's' by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = Number of classes * Class duration
Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class
Total class time = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the total class time by the number of weeks:
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks
Total class time = 48 hours

Now, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe:
Number of recipes = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3.
Each person's share = Total money / 3
Each person's share = $360 / 3
Each person's share = $120

For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

The final answer is: 132"
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had. 

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount by 3.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each person will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the first 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The remaining 10 days were neutral.

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the updated count of good days is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x' to find the number of books Sally has. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the target height (600 inches) by the growth rate (30 inches/day).

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. 

Since 3 dogs were gone, James no longer needed those toys, so he only needed toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

So, Skyler's investment was 240 dollars.

240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, and then determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can set up an equation to find out how many cookies Max has: 
Katarina's cookies + 5 = Max's cookies
68 + 5 = Max's cookies
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:
Max's cookies + 12 = Cookie Monster's cookies
73 + 12 = Cookie Monster's cookies
Cookie Monster's cookies = 85

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies:
Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies = Total cookies
68 + 73 + 85 = Total cookies
226 = Total cookies

The final answer is: 226"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

We also know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, which is the result of adding 20cm to the extended length. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to divide the time taken in each mode by 2.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 60 / 2 = 30 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time taken in both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station and the corner = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Time spent walking to the corner and the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked by Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (by Greta) + 60 (by Celinda) = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the remaining number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

The combined ages of the twins and triplets would be the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplets. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total number of individuals is 5. 

The combined ages can be represented as: 
x + (x + 7) + 2x + 3x = 44

Combine like terms: 
6x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 
6x = 37

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 6.17

Since 'x' represents the age of the younger twin, the age of one of the twins is 6.17 years."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Since John wants to finish his homework before napping, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4): 
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: 
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year and then by the number of years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides:
0.6x - x = $40
0.6x - x = $40
0.6x - 0.6x = $40 - x
0 = $40 - 0.6x
0.6x = $40
x = $40 / 0.6
x = $66.67

Now that we know the total bill is $66.67, we can find out how much John leaves with:
$125 - $66.67 = $58.33

John leaves with $58.33."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for a crate of this fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find the number of regular chairs, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5, as the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. 

Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of babies = 42 + 15 = 57

To find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs she already has from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of chairs needed - Number of regular chairs = 57 - 40 = 17

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks. 

First, we find the total number of bucks: 50% of 50 deer = 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the total number of bucks: 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great grand-babies. 

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children, so the number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks consumed is 20 * 2 = 40 drinks, and the total number of snacks consumed is 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 40 * 2 = $80, and the total cost of snacks is 60 * 2 = $120.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $80 + $120 = $200.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

We also know there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. 

Total dumplings cooked = dumplings eaten by males + dumplings eaten by females
Total dumplings cooked = 32 + 18
Total dumplings cooked = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald spent $10, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had initially. Let's assume Gerald's share is 3x. 

3x = (3/5) * 100 
3x = 60 
x = 20 

Gerald's share is 3x = 3 * 20 = $60. 

Since Gerald spent $10, he had $60 - $10 = $50 left."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise. 

The amount they still need to raise is the difference between their goal and the amount they have already raised: 
$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount they still need to raise by the number of hours they have already worked to find the amount they raise per hour:
$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount they still need to raise by the amount they raise per hour to find the total number of hours they need to work:
$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Let's assume the total percentage of the river's water used by the city is x. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can set up the equation:

80% of x = 40%

To solve for x, we can convert the percentages to decimals and divide both sides by 0.8:

0.8x = 0.4

x = 0.4 / 0.8
x = 0.5

Now that we know the total percentage of the river's water used by the city, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 0.5:

0.5 - 0.8 = -0.3

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 0.5. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since 80% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage is used for non-industrial purposes. 

The correct approach is to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, the city uses 20% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 20%"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 2 * 7 = 14 days.

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to first determine the rate of production for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To calculate the total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount. 10% of $50.00 is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is $45.00."
"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy. 

4 scoops ÷ 3 scoops per set = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can only buy whole sets, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops (2 scoops paid for, 1 scoop free) and 1 additional scoop. 

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Now, let's calculate the savings: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers.

Total amount = Number of computers * New price of each computer
= 500 * $770
= $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each weighing 2 oz. Since the problem states that the ham is equal in amount to the cheese, we can assume that the ham also weighs 2 oz. 

Eggs: 6 eggs * 2 oz/egg * 75 calories/oz = 6 * 2 * 75 = 900 calories
Cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories
Ham: 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Total calories in the omelet: 900 + 240 + 80 = 1220 calories

The final answer is: 1220"

The difference in the number of boxes of cereal bought this week and last week is 4."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the time spent in that scenario.

When both hands are at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, the combined rate is 200 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total. She spends 2 minutes with her arms raised and 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.

The number of taps with her arms raised is 200 * 2 = 400 taps.

The number of taps with her arms at her sides is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

The total number of taps is 400 + 1650 = 2050 taps.

The final answer is: 2050"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then subtract the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of the damage to the car is $450. The cost of fixing the pothole himself is the cost of the asphalt, which is 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75. 

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage) + $75 (asphalt) = $525. 

The cost of the fine is $120. 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $525 (total cost) + $120 (fine) = $645.

Ron saves $645 (total cost) - $450 (damage) = $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 * 2/3 = 2 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 2 * 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. Since 1 ½ pizzas is equivalent to 1 pizza and 6 slices, they ate 1 * 12 + 6 = 18 slices.

Now, let's subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

For students' cars:

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we can find the total number of spools by adding the number of spools of each color.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

   2/5 * 5000 = 2000

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people):
   2/3 * 3000 = 2000

4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he needs for 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since a pack has 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know the weights of the math and science books are 2 pounds each, so their combined weight is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds and the English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes received by candidate A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know both Clara and Alice have their respective number of books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, Carl has as C, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S = 4 * 56 = 224.

Additionally, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = L/2. Since S = 56, we can find L by multiplying both sides by 2, giving us L = 2S = 2 * 56 = 112.

Now that we have the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles: C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth 1 small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the first trade, 60 small buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. 
So, she has a total of 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she can convert her large buttons to small buttons. 
She has 20 large buttons, so she can convert them to 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 147 small buttons and 60 small buttons from the large buttons. 
So, she has a total of 147 + 60 = 207 small buttons.

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, the amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply that result by the length of each song.

Number of songs in each playlist = 20
Number of playlists = 20
Length of each song = 10 hours

Total number of songs = 20 * 20 = 400
Total hours = 400 * 10 = 4000

The 20 playlists will last for 4000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 
60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 or horse #7 will win, there are 50 - 34 = 16 people who think horse #12 will win.

16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation to represent this:
2/3 * Total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first and second houses need.

Let's denote the number of cases the first house needs as x. Since the second house needs half of the first house, it will need x/2 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, so it will need 2x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

7x = 500

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 71.43

Now that we know the first house needs approximately 71.43 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases the third house needs:

2x = 2 * 71.43 = 142.86

So, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

142.86"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, add this to the number of bananas: 
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 fruits in total."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To determine the cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 20 kilograms.

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of kilograms required (20) by the cost per kilogram ($3).

Total cost = 20 kilograms * $3 per kilogram = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra will read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can find the number of books Ahmed read by dividing the total number of books Ezra read by 2. 

450 / 2 = 225

Now, we can find the total number of books read by adding the number of books Ezra and Ahmed read.

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day, so:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day, so:
$30 + $5 = $35

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 + $35 = $100

Tanya earned $100 for these two days of teaching."
"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents."
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to earn $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to earn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we first need to find the remaining time after reading. 

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 7 + 5 - 3 = 9 hours.

Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, the time spent playing video games is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (6 / (7 + 5)) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends the same amount of time driving back, the total time taken for the round trip is:
Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time taken to drive back
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is:
Total time gone = Total time + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the available wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

$800"
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movies in series. Since they cost $6 each, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Now, let's calculate the cost of the older movies. Since they cost $5 each, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * 5
= $800

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 normal movies and each costs $10, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 400 * 10
= $4000

Now, let's add up the costs of all the movies to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $4000
= $5000

The final answer is: $5000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:

Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they hiked:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Since the total time they spent driving and hiking is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, they must have spent 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours driving.

Now, we can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they drove:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 50 miles per hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 225 miles

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:

Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's points:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish after the purchase would be 2 times the number of white fish.

The total number of fish initially was 7, and 17 fish were added, so the total number of fish after the purchase is 7 + 17 = 24.

The number of white fish after the purchase is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish). The number of orange fish after the purchase is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish).

Since the total number of fish after the purchase is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

7 + 3x = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish.

x = 5

So, Bob bought 5 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 10 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 1 gallon

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 1 gallon * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the weekly fuel cost. 

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find the number of twenties she spent, we multiply 10 by 3/5:
10 * 3/5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties she spent is:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch:
$35 + $120 = $155

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has from it. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150."
"To determine the number of logs needed, we first need to find the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

The difference between these two temperatures is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Total people = 90
Number of people in each group = 9

Total number of groups = Total people / Number of people in each group
Total number of groups = 90 / 9
Total number of groups = 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Total number of groups
Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is the number of groups with seashells multiplied by 2.

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * 2
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12"

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise of $0.50, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise of $1.00, his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 
Sally's hourly wage is also $0.50 more than Billy's, so her hourly wage is $11.50 + $0.50 = $12.00. 
Now, we can calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$12.00 * 20 = $240.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$240 - $230 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the children and the number of trees planted by the teachers.

Number of trees planted by children: 
Number of classes = 40
Number of students per class = 25
Number of trees planted by each student = 1
Total number of trees planted by children = 40 * 25 = 1000

Number of trees planted by teachers:
Number of classes = 40
Number of teachers per class = 3
Number of trees planted by each teacher = 2
Total number of trees planted by teachers = 40 * 3 * 2 = 240

Total number of trees planted = 1000 + 240 = 1240

The total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day for 14 days. 
Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days.
Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost James paid is the cost of the diamond and gold plus the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, so it is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we multiply the number of chips per bag by the number of bags: 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area: 144 chips / 12 chips/inch² = 12 inches².

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we multiply the area by the height to find the length: 12 inches² * 3 inches = 36 inches.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. 

First, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has now: 
100 (initial candies) + 100 (new candies) = 200 candies

Since he sold 150 candies, we subtract that from the total: 
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students on campus by the end of May.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

By the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 3 = 12 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 4 = 20 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 5 = 15 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 6 = 36 petals

Now, let's add the remaining petals for each type of flower: 
12 + 20 + 15 + 36 = 83 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 83."
"To find the total number of S'mores they can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The better friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, we need to convert the total time to quarters. There are 15 minutes in a quarter, so we divide the total time by 15: 70 minutes / 15 minutes/quarter = 4.67 quarters.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a quarter, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't buy 0.67 quarters, so we'll just use 5 quarters.

The total cost is 5 quarters."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the first two equations into the fourth equation, we get:
S + O + S + S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
3S + O = 10

Now, substitute O = 2S into the equation:
3S + 2S = 10
Combine like terms:
5S = 10

Divide both sides by 5:
S = 2

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(2)
O = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, she walked for:

8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

Converting this to minutes:

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time:

480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that time: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is 150 * 7 = 1050 tasks.

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in a week is 1050 * $1.20 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3.00 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

Production for the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000

The final answer is 14,000."

Time spent on TikTok videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We will calculate the cost of the standard items and then subtract the number of items Angela needs.

The cost of the standard items is:
- 4 mirrors: 4 * $129.00 = $516.00
- 2 shelves: 2 * $129.00 = $258.00
- 1 chandelier: 1 * $129.00 = $129.00
- 10 pictures: 10 * $129.00 = $1290.00

Total cost of standard items: $516.00 + $258.00 + $129.00 + $1290.00 = $1993.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:
- 6 mirrors: 6 * $15.00 = $90.00
- 2 chandeliers: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- 20 pictures: 20 * $15.00 = $300.00

Total cost of additional items: $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $420.00

Now, we add the cost of the standard items and the additional items:
$1993.00 + $420.00 = $2413.00

The total cost for Angela will be $2413.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much Roy has, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

So, Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can start by finding the height of the mountain Saskay can lift. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. 
So, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. 
So, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the time it takes them to travel across the highway. Since the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed, we can set up a proportion.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the time taken by 3 kangaroos as 't'. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway. 

Since the speed of the turtles is half that of the kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is k/2.

Now, we can set up the proportion:

3k * t = 18

Since the time taken by 4 turtles is the same as the time taken by 3 kangaroos, we can set up another proportion:

4 * (k/2) * t = 18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2k * t = 18

Now we have two equations:

3k * t = 18
2k * t = 18

Dividing the first equation by the second equation, we get:

(3k * t) / (2k * t) = 18 / 2
3/2 = 9

This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Since the speed of the turtles is half that of the kangaroo, the time taken by the turtles will be twice that of the kangaroo. 

So, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, 4 turtles will take 2 * 18 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many clay dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has now is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much she had initially:
$400 - $230 = $50

$170 = $170

This means she had $170 in her purse initially."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate (15 slices) from the total number of slices: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

There are 15 apple slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current cows produce. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk the current cows produce is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows to produce 10 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 
The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone.

$5600"
"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

Total amount paid = 4 * $20 = $80

Change received = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
= $80 - $70
= $10

The final answer is $10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half as many dishes as Peter, we can set up an equation to find the number of dishes Peter has. 

Let's denote the number of dishes Peter has as P and the number of socks Peter has as S. We know that Jack has twice as many socks as Peter, so the number of socks Jack has is 2S. We also know that Jack has 60 dishes, which is half of Peter's dishes. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2S = 60 (since Jack has half as many dishes as Peter)

Now, we can solve for S: S = 60 / 2 = 30

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2S = 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 60 socks. To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes: 60 + 60 = 120.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time required for each group, we need to add the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. 

Time for each group = 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting the stage) = 10 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time for the intermission from the total concert time to find the available time for the groups. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Available time for groups = Total concert time - Time for intermission = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we can divide the available time by the time required for each group to find the number of groups that can perform.

Number of groups = Available time for groups / Time for each group = 110 minutes / 10 minutes = 11

The final answer is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1615.28."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640
Number of pairs purchased per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

123"
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90, so 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room: 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 900 / 60 = 15 hours.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the next year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the previous two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary as the question asks for a numerical answer."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 infected people.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20: 
10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total:
$20 - $2 = $18

Now, we add the amount Julieta received to Rafaela's amount:
$18 + $20 = $38

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips is $38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 * 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices baked and sold. 

Paige baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, the total number of loaves baked is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 
The number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 

Now, we can solve for 'x': 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40 

So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We can subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the number of yellow cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together, they have 85 books, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has by adding 12 to Anne's total:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To determine the total amount of jello needed, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. 

There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. 

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is $15."
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total cost is $400. 
40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. 

To find out how much he spends per week, we divide the monthly cost by 4. 
$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day. Since he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling them is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we can subtract the desired profit from the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, we know that Isaias needs to sell the chickens for $7000 to make a profit of $2000. Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the cost of each chicken as follows:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale for approximately $38.89."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, they each sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 10.67 (Micah's glasses) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3(8)

Simplifying the equation: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides: x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * (1/2 * $4) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart. She is short $91."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

Now, divide the result by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts:
50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys = 200
Toys given away = 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, 80% of the microphones can be arranged. 

Number of microphones that can be arranged = 80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is half of the total number of microphones that can be arranged.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's calculate the number of birds feeding: 
3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, we add the number of birds in each category: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani placed into the jars. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so the number of cookies left is 55 - 5 = 50.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we divide the remaining cookies by 5. 

50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. 

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5x. Substituting the value of x, we get 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

Mark makes $480 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x.

However, we don't know the value of x. We can find the value of x by using the information that she mowed Joe's lawn x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since we don't have any other information about the number of times she mowed lawns, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we can express the amount she made from lemonade sales in terms of x.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x.

To find the value of x, we need more information."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is 74."
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had initially.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we know Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number:

12 - 2.33 = 9.67

So Martha now has 9.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 

Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 18 - 13 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can hold 8 bowls (the larger number). 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 5 people. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, Calvin can have 8 / 5 = 1.6 bowls. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 bowl for Calvin and his wife, and 8 / 5 = 1.6, which rounds down to 1 bowl for the two children.

Now, we have 8 - 3 = 5 bowls of soup left. Since there are 2 children, we can divide 5 by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 5 / 2 = 2.5, which rounds down to 2.

So, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, the material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yards per mask.

For 20 small masks, the total material needed is 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yards per mask.

For 8 large masks, the total material needed is 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards.

The total material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks is 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets Deepa has bought. Since she has seen each movie 3 times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount she spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial blue shoe boxes = 7
Used blue shoe boxes = 3
Remaining blue shoe boxes = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial red shoe boxes = 9
Used red shoe boxes = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Remaining red shoe boxes = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount: 30 - 16 = 14.

Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Adam's current age. 

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. 

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, the total number of packages he completes in a day is 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is $64."
"To determine the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for both normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and extreme sudoku takes 4 times that, which is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Total time spent on sudoku = 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles = Total time / 30 = 225 / 30 = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of bottles = 7.5 ≈ 7"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. 

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. We know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, and the number of red balloons is 20. 

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

The remaining bologna pieces were thrown at yellow balloons, which is 58 - 40 = 18. 

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the remaining bologna pieces by 3. 

y = 18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed.

3000 / 1000 = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce in the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they have the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each girl received. $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total number of fruits initially, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing soccer: 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students.

Now, we add the students from each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

The total number of students is 56."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats. 
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells, which is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours):

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

12"
"To find the initial amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's capacity. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the remaining water after 6 days by subtracting the total amount emptied from the initial amount in the tank.

5000 gallons (initial amount) - (500 gallons/day * 6 days) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The remaining water in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons."
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to subtract the cost of the popcorn and candy from his remaining allowance, then divide by the cost of a movie ticket to find out how many movies he can see.

$134 - $8 = $126
$126 / $10 = 12.6

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, we round down to 12 movies.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are 2 days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + A + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:

A = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:

P = A + J

Now we can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute this expression for P into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + A + J = 100

Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting J into the equation A = J + 10:

A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age by substituting A into the equation P = A + J:

P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 x 2 = 8.

Maria also had 2 balloons for herself, so the total number of balloons is 8 + 2 = 10.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial total number of balloons (10) to the additional balloons (15) to get the final total: 10 + 15 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

25"
"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we subtract this from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The additional hours are 5 hours. 

The cost of the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = number of goats * goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = number of sheep * sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide 100 by 25, which is 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each pupil gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the total number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into three components: the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Fixed charge: $40
2. Labor charge: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, we add the fixed charge, labor charge, and parts charge to get the total cost.

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110."
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Since James rests for half as long as the swimming time, we can calculate the resting time as follows:

Resting time = Swimming time / 2
Resting time = 6 hours / 2
Resting time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim at half the speed. The remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the swimming time, resting time, and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = Swimming time + Resting time + Time to swim remaining distance
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times: 
6 copies * 10% * $5 = 6 * 0.10 * 5 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * 8% * $15 = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission = Commission from the New York Times + Commission from the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is $15."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between Marcus, Leo, and Deanna's ages.

Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = 0.5L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of D into the equation M = D - 5 to get M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Since M = 0.5L, we can substitute the value of M into this equation to get 21 = 0.5L.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us L = 21 * 2 = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Azibo scored x points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three team members is 45. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to first find the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to find the total number of pages. 

Number of pages per inch = 2
Thickness of the book = 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 2 * 1.5
Total number of pages = 3

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time spent stapling reports. 

First, we need to find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of 15-minute intervals:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she spent outside of bed.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept.

480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the minutes she spent sleepwalking. She sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes.

Now, we need to add the minutes she spent sleepwalking to the total minutes she slept.

475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 498 minutes that day."
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first convert two dozen to a numerical value: 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we calculate 2/3 of 24: (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons. After gifting 6 measuring spoons, he has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, 200 beds are occupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted would be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks would be 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (added) = 900 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Total occupied beds = 900 beds
Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900
Unoccupied beds = 100

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation to find the number of balls Jeffrey carried. 

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. We know Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 1

This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jordan carried 2x = 2 * 1 = 2 balls.

Now that we know the number of balls each boy carried, we can find the total number of balls. The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:

Total = Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls + Jordan's balls
Total = 2 + 1 + 2
Total = 5

The coach brought 5 basketballs to practice."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this: 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day.

4 * 31 = 124

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, we can represent Collins' amount as 70 + 15 = 85.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amounts Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 85, we can add these amounts together to find the total.

70 + 70 + 85 = 225

Therefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we have the value of A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

The bird's northern home is 446 miles north of her southern home."
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member and then add them together.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

2. Calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

3. Calculate the total number of oranges she gave away: 40 oranges (to mom and sister) + 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box (for herself) = 40 + 40 = 80 oranges.

4. Calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 240 * 1/4 = 60 oranges.

5. Calculate the number of oranges she sold: 240 oranges (initial) - 80 oranges (given away) - 60 oranges (kept) = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) ÷ $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'x'. 
Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, we can write the equation as: 
x + 10 = 30

Solving for x, we get: 
x = 30 - 10 
x = 20 

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard has from the total number of cherries: 
60 - 20 = 40 

So, Jerry has 40 cherries. 

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 
30 - 40 = -10 

However, since we can't have a negative number of cherries, this means that Robert actually has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
Let's assume the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is x. 
Then, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is x - 4.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. 
So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 10 + 5 = 15.

We know that the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 15, so we can set up an equation for the apple pie: 
x - 4 = 15
x = 19

Now we know that Sunny sold 19 boxes of apple pie on Sunday. 
So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 19 - 4 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:
Gingerbread: 
Saturday: 10 * $6 = $60
Sunday: 15 * $6 = $90
Total gingerbread earnings: $60 + $90 = $150

Apple pie:
Saturday: 15 * $15 = $225
Sunday: 19 * $15 = $285
Total apple pie earnings: $225 + $285 = $510

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $510 = $660"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

$100"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: 
D = 2 * 24 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B:
B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother:
D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 
30 - 6 = 24 students

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 
6 + 6 = 12 students"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we can calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. 

Each plant takes up 12 inches (width) + 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space. 
Total space per plant = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

Total space in the bed = 1332 inches
Space per plant = 30 inches
Number of plants = Total space / Space per plant = 1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers, 4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.
For the carnations, 10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we can calculate how much she sets aside for shoes in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we divide the total amount she sets aside for shoes by the cost of each pair:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the time it takes her to peel 30 shrimp is also 10 minutes. 

Now, we can calculate the time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp by multiplying the time it takes to peel and cook 30 shrimp by 3.

Time to peel and cook 90 shrimp = 10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner and then subtract the warming effect of the room.

The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:

Low mode: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees
High mode: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees
Total cooling effect: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees

Now, let's calculate the warming effect of the room:
The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour, and it was off for 2 hours, so the warming effect is:
2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the total cooling effect from the total warming effect to find the net change in temperature:
Net change = Total cooling effect - Total warming effect
Net change = 18 - 4
Net change = 14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can represent Bill's age at that time as 3x.

We know that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. Since Bill's father saw the comet first at age x, and Bill saw it at age 3x, the time elapsed is 3x - x = 2x years.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2x = 75. Solving for x, we get x = 75 / 2 = 37.5.

Since x represents the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time, we can find Bill's age at that time by multiplying x by 3: 3x = 3 * 37.5 = 112.5.

Therefore, Bill was 112.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 112.5"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane's flights are split between Greece and France. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

Therefore, the first plane makes 22 flights to France in one day.

22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam initially spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We are given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice the average age, H = 2 * 5 = 10. 

Now, we know the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). We can set up an equation to find Wilfred's age: 

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 

Combine the known ages: 17 + W = 20 

Subtract 17 from both sides: W = 3 

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is x. Then, the total amount Walter has is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, the total amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

However, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200. So, we need to subtract $200 from $6600. 

$6600 - $200 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

First, we find the total number of cookies: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies.

Then, we find half of the total number of cookies: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15: 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. The total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adults get 4 slices, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (4/6) * 100 = 66.67%.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available in a day:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time. 

Serving time: 5:00 pm
Total time: 3 hours

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter, and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

64"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the weekly cost is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly revenue from the students is $15 * 3 = $45.

The monthly revenue from the students is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the revenue from the students: $300 + $180 = $480.

480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chocolate bars in each box. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. 

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. 

We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

Solving for x, we get:
x = 64 / 4 = 16
x = 56 / 7 = 8

Since x = 16, we can see that Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box. 

Now, to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract Martha's number of chocolate bars per box from Peter's number of chocolate bars per box:

16 - 8 = 8

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:
4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Total porcupines = Initial female porcupines + Total babies born
= 30 + 48
= 78

The final answer is 78."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the depth. The area of the base is the length times the width, so the area is 14 * 25 = 350 square feet. 

Since the depth is 4 feet, the volume of the pool is 350 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet. 

Now, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so the volume in gallons is 1400 * 7.48 = 10480 gallons.

The cost to fill the pool is 10480 gallons * $0.10 per gallon = $1048.

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue and yellow sticks. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo is 230 miles."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day, we need to calculate the amount each of them pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is 6000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.09x * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
= 0.55x - 0.1025x
= 0.4475x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly income and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's price.

First, let's calculate her total weekly income:
Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment:
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks it will take her to save the down payment, we'll divide the total amount needed by her weekly income:
$2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 6 portraits and 27 selfies.

6"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first determine how long it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read. 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon is twice that number, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

Additionally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who checked in to the number of guests who remained in the hotel: 76 + 37 = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal. 

Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. 

The earnings from large stuffed animals is $12x (since each large stuffed animal is sold for $12).
The earnings from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total earnings is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
= 0.10 * $2000
= $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red + 7 green + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework: 60% (100% - 40% chance of collection)

Now, we need to find the probability of each scenario and add them up:

- Probability of normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
- Probability of normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
- Probability of substitute teacher coming in and not collecting homework: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36

Adding these probabilities together: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.36 = 0.96

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.96 * 100 = 96%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 96%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3.

150 * 3 = 450

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

450"
"To calculate Melissa's total earnings, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Her daily earnings are $15 per day. Since she spends 3 days, her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45. 

Her parking expenses are $3 per day, so for 3 days, her total parking expenses are 3 * 3 = $9. 

Now, we subtract her parking expenses from her total earnings: 45 - 9 = $36. 

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total hours she worked: 36 / 18 (6 hours * 3 days) = $2 per hour."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of packs, we need to first find the total number of apples in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box, so in two boxes, there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years before college, he earned:

$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

After graduating, he earns $75,000 per year. To find the total amount of money he earned after graduating, we need to add the money he earned before college and the money he earned after graduating:

$100,000 + $75,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money he lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned after graduating:

$200,000 + $400,000 = $600,000

Since Jim earns $75,000 per year after graduating, we can calculate the number of years it would take him to earn the total amount of money he needs:

$600,000 / $75,000/year = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

$600,000"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the fabric is calculated by multiplying the length and width, so the area is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the area by 2 to get the total amount of fabric needed. 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The post office delivered 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $32.5 / 3 = $10.83

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $10.83."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height in inches is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67."
"To find the total hours worked by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, we need to find the total hours worked in a day. Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we can convert this to hours by dividing 3/8 by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day).

3/8 ÷ 24 = 3/8 * 1/24 = 3/192 hours per day

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to multiply the hours worked per day by 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equal to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Total hours worked by the team = (3/192) * 21 = 3/8 * 7 = 21/16 = 1.3125 days

Now, we need to find the hours worked by each painter. Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by 4.

Hours worked by each painter = 1.3125 / 4 = 0.328125 hours

The final answer is 0.328125."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. 

We can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and eliminate the fraction. 

First, multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

This simplifies to: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: 
Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2008: 
Initial price = $15,800
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2009: 
Initial price = $12,482
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

The total number of non-Spanish books is 25 (English) + 5 (German) = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 - 325
Remaining distance = 1630 kilometers

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total number of cups: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since the floor area is 200 SqFt and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total floor area by the area of each tile:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twin beds and 1 load for the king bed per week. 
So, the total number of loads per week is 2 + 1 = 3.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 3 * 52 = 156.

156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final answer is 24."
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 (two years ago) + 150 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount of cat food (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up an equation:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can calculate Silvia's slices as follows:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, which is half of an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hour = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The cost of parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($120), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost is $150 + $200 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails don't require a response, so we calculate 20% of 80 as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number eaten from the total number ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total postage cost, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
So, Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every 2 pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 pounds of butter.

The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00, so the cost of 4.5 pounds of butter will be 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is $18.00."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 

315 - 10 - 14 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total bananas the third monkey eats in a day by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas per day."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces within an hour.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

750"
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we first need to determine the cost of the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, and a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozen roses
1.25 dozen roses * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to convert $6.25 to quarters. 

$6.25 / $0.25 = 25 quarters

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 120 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. 
Original price = $2000 / 0.75 = $2666.67

He then sold the watch at 120% of the price he bought it for. 
Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20 = $3200

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price.
Discount = Original price - Selling price
= $2666.67 - $3200
= -$533.33

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.
Percentage discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
= -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend obtained a discount, but we are interested in the percentage of the discount, so we take the absolute value.
Percentage discount = 20%"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours as follows:

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours = 3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be:

Total jellyfish = 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, the distance to the store is 4 miles, so the distance he walked to the store is half of that, which is 2 miles. 

The time it took him to walk to the store is the distance divided by the rate, which is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he has to walk back home, which is the same distance of 2 miles. The time it took him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since Jenny bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

First, we find the total minutes he spends in classes per day: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
1/16 * 60 minutes = 3.75 minutes per day
3.75 minutes per day * 2 days = 7.5 minutes per week

Now, we add the total minutes he spends in classes and the extra minutes:
1200 minutes per week + 7.5 minutes per week = 1207.5 minutes per week

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1207.5 minutes per week / 60 = 20.125 hours per week

The final answer is 20.125."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball reaches 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. This means the T-Rex ate 540 / 2 = 270 kilograms of meat.

To find the initial amount, we need to add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate. So, the initial amount is 270 + 540 = 810 kilograms.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can. 

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total. Ellen shook 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. 

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Now, when Ellen's friend arrives, there are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and the number of people he can help per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in March: 31 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so the number of days he is available to work is:
31 * (1 - 0.2) = 31 * 0.8 = 24.8 days

Since Billy can't work a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 24 days (he can't help people on a fraction of an hour).

Now, let's calculate the number of people he can help per day:
2 people per hour * 3 hours per day = 6 people per day

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day:
24 days * 6 people per day = 144 people

The final answer is: 144"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses = Number of buses * Number of people per bus
= 12 * 35
= 420

Number of people in cars = Number of cars * Number of people per car
= 20 * 3
= 60

Total number of people = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
= 420 + 60
= 480

The final answer is 480."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age can be calculated as:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age can be calculated as:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = (4/5)*x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since only large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. 

We can set up the equation: x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6*15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Ben and then Caroline's age based on the given information.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can calculate Caroline's age since she is three times older than Ben:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

First, let's calculate her annual savings: 
Annual salary = $100,000
Savings rate = 20% = 0.20
Annual savings = Annual salary * Savings rate
Annual savings = $100,000 * 0.20
Annual savings = $20,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement:
Retirement period = 20 years
Annual savings = $20,000
Total amount needed = Annual savings * Retirement period
Total amount needed = $20,000 * 20
Total amount needed = $400,000

Now, let's calculate how many years she needs to work to save the required amount:
Current salary = $100,000
Annual savings = $20,000
Years needed = Total amount needed / Annual savings
Years needed = $400,000 / $20,000
Years needed = 20

However, this calculation assumes she saves 20% of her salary every year, but she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary. This means she will have 60% of her salary left to save each year. 

Let's recalculate the years needed:
Annual savings = 60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000
Years needed = Total amount needed / Annual savings
Years needed = $400,000 / $60,000
Years needed = 6.67

Since you can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for approximately 7 years to save enough for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This gives us the length of each of the initial cuts: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.

2. Then, we take the length of each initial cut (25 cm) and divide it by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This gives us the length of each final cut: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

5 cm"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, and we know that 240 boys make up 40% of the school population, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the remaining 60% of the total population, which is:

60% of 600 = 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent by your mom, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon value.

Cost of pots: $19
Cost of soil: $26
Total cost before coupon: $19 + $26 = $45
Coupon value: $7
Total cost after coupon: $45 - $7 = $38

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels, which is 6. 

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels = 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

9,300"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and then add them together.

The total cost of red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.
The total cost of blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.
The total cost of green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the total costs together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

$8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

The difference between the number of female and male fish is: 8 - 6 = 2"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + x hours, where x is more than 4. However, since we are given that Dior took ""well over 4 hours longer"" than Amalia, we can assume the minimum additional time is 5 hours. Therefore, Dior took 4 + 5 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time each person took to complete their tasks: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 9 (Dior) = 19 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this by 2 to get the total round trip distance: 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the round trip distance by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply 10 miles by 7 days to find the total distance she will walk.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance she will walk by 2 to find the distance Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 20 / 10 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Now, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog to find the total weight of both dogs: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9, so Luis must have given Kris 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, the total number of stickers Seth gave to Luis must be twice the number of stickers Kris received. Therefore, Seth gave Luis 2 * 16 = 32 stickers.

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, the total number of stickers Seth had initially must be twice the number of stickers he gave to Luis. Therefore, Seth had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 
3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Then, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Circumference of the earth = 40,000 kilometers
Half of the circumference = 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the distance by his daily flight to find the number of days it will take him to fly half of the way around the earth.

Number of days = Total distance / Daily distance
= 20,000 / 400

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5 to find the 2nd fastest car's speed:
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25:
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The faster car can go 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. 

Number of boxes = Total crayons / Crayons per box
Number of boxes = 200 / 8
Number of boxes = 25

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is:
Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight per box
Total weight of crayons = 25 * 8
Total weight of crayons = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight of the crayons to pounds:
Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons / 16
Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = 200 / 16
Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is:
Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight per box
Total weight of boxes = 25 * 8
Total weight of boxes = 200 ounces

Converting the total weight of the boxes to pounds:
Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = Total weight of boxes / 16
Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = 200 / 16
Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie and her brother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries. 

Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, let's denote her brother's salary as x. Then Valerie's salary is 1/2x. 

We know that Valerie's salary is $5000, so we can set up the equation: 1/2x = 5000. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 5000 * 2 = 10000. 

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. 

Now, we can find their combined salary: Valerie's salary + brother's salary = 5000 + 10000 = 15000. 

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * 15000 = 30000. 

The total amount of money they all have together is Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 38000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. 

Given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 80 = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 120 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the amount of water in each mug is not specified. However, we can use the information about the temperature to help us solve the problem.

Let's assume the unknown mug has x ounces of water. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has now is 4 + (x - 1) = x + 3 ounces.

We also know that the total amount of water Donny has is 2 mugs, so the total amount of water in both mugs is 2(x + 3). Since he can drink the water after pouring, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. After pouring 4 ounces from this mug, the amount of water left in the mug is 33 - 4 = 29 ounces. The amount of water in the bottle is 1 ounce.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(29 + x - 1) / 2 ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(28 + x) / 2 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

28 + x ≥ 80

Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 52

So, the minimum amount of water in the unknown mug is 52 ounces. Since the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees, we can assume the temperature of the water in the bottle is 40 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, Melanie's father has 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Cows added per day: 20
Chickens added per day: 10

Number of days in three weeks: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Total cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of scoops as S and the number of potatoes as P. We can set up the equation: 
P = 6 - 3 = 3
S = P - 3
S = 3 - 3
S = 0

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can set up the equation:
S = 23 - 5
S = 18

Now, we know that S = 18. We can use the equation S = P - 3 to find the number of potatoes:
18 = P - 3
P = 18 + 3
P = 21

So, Gomer ate 21 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs he eats is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs he eats is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus:

(9/14) = x/84

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

9x = 84 * 9
9x = 756
x = 756 / 9
x = 84

So, there were 84 women on the bus initially.

Now, we need to subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus:

84 - 20 = 64

Therefore, 64 women have remained on the bus.

64"
"To find the number of sunflowers sold, we need to first find the number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 3: 
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold: 
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. Since the revenue is $84, Adam loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

Each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information. However, we can express the number of seashells each person got in terms of 'x'."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 

20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30

The total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we can add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette.

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes
Total time = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."

The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand for each person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that 1 bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand for 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Since each bottle covers 0.2 units of energy, we need 460 / 0.2 = 2300 bottles to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 2300 - 4200 = -1900. However, this is not possible since Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles.

This means that Hortex cannot satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people with their current production capacity."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

2. Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

3. Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing a bow. Since 1/3 of the babies wear bows, the total number of babies wearing a bow is 1/3 * 8 = 2.67 (round down to 2, since we can't have a fraction of a baby).

4. Finally, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow by the total number of babies wearing a bow, and then multiplying by 100. 

Probability = (2 / 2.67) * 100 ≈ 74.7%

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

Abraham initially sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from this sale.

Next, he sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. Since he had 40 square meters left after the first sale, 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, he earned $30 from this sale.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 30 * $3 = $90 from this sale.

To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits each tree produces in each year.

A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by each tree:
5-year-old tree: 50
6-year-old tree: 150
7-year-old tree: 350
8-year-old tree: 300
9-year-old tree: 0
10-year-old tree: 1000

Total number of fruits produced in 10 years = 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as 'y'. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, its length can be represented as y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length can be represented as 4(y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6y - 28 = 37

Add 28 to both sides:

6y = 65

Divide both sides by 6:

y = 10.83

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope length = y - 7 = 10.83 - 7 = 3.83

Now, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(10.83 - 7) = 4(3.83) = 15.32

The length of the red rope is 15.32 centimeters."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was given $15 and gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to his sister, he also gave $3. 

Ronnie was given $5, so he is left with 5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into three equal parts for red, white, and purple paint. 

Let's denote the amount of paint for each color as 'x'. Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple) and they are equal, we can say that the total amount of paint for these three colors is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, so the other half is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. This 6 pints is divided into three equal parts for red, white, and purple paint, so each part is 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Since 3x = 2, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: x = 2 / 3.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of red paint used by multiplying x by 1 (since there is one part of red paint): 2 / 3 * 1 = 2 / 3 pints.

The final answer is 2/3."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost of the new box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, it has 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120 pods. 

The cost of the new box is the same as the regular box, which is $12. 

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. To do this, we divide $1 by the cost of the new box, which is $12. 

$1 / $12 = 1/12 

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll convert this to a decimal: 1/12 ≈ 0.0833. 

Now, we multiply this by the number of pods in the new box (120) to find the number of cycles: 0.0833 * 120 ≈ 10. 

So, you can run approximately 10 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals"
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can set up an equation to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk.

Let's denote the number of days as 'x'. The remaining chalk after 'x' days will be 2.25 inches. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the remaining chalk after 'x' days will be 0.2x inches.

We can set up the equation: 0.2x = 2.25

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.2:

x = 2.25 / 0.2
x = 11.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 11 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 1/3 * 12 = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought. 

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike is 3 times 5, which is 15. 

2 more than 15 is 15 + 2, which is 17. 

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus received a refund for the returned milk, we need to calculate the total refund amount. 

The cost of 1 gallon of milk is $3.5. 

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how much he can spend per school. 

Bob has $27,000 and is distributing it among 3 schools. 

$27,000 ÷ 3 = $9,000 per school

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find out how many books he can buy with $9,000 by dividing $9,000 by $500.

$9,000 ÷ $500 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 books per school."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas."
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles
Miles on Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can find the rate of melting snowballs: 2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour.

Since Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour and 8 melt per hour, the net rate of building snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of building snowballs: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age when Digimon was released, and then find Jim's current age.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, John's age at the time of Digimon's release would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, and we also know that the time elapsed since Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28 - x (since John is 28 now, and x years have passed since Digimon's release)

Simplifying the equation: 2x + x = 28
3x = 28
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since x represents Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we need to find Jim's current age. The time elapsed since Digimon's release is 20 years. 

Jim's current age = x + 20
Jim's current age = 9.33 + 20
Jim's current age = 29.33

The final answer is 29.33."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages after the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages after the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages after the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant at each time and then add them up.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

At 10:00, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
So, the total number of people now is 90 + 80 = 170.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. 
The number of people who came in first is 40, so 3 times that is 3 * 40 = 120 people. 
Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression is equal to 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the height of the roof is not directly given, but we can find it by subtracting the height of the second floor from the total height of the house and then subtracting the height of the first floor.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of the capacity of Ali's class and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

Capacity of Ali's class = 120 students
1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15 students
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students."
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $275 + $6 = $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since Jordan has 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will be responsible for changing the other half. Therefore, Jordan will change 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = Volume / 0.8 
Total number of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8 
Total number of jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round down to 202 red jelly beans.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference between the true number and Tim's guess is:

Difference = True number - Tim's guess 
Difference = 900 - 202 
Difference = 698 

The final answer is: 698"
"To find the total number of people on the bus after the third station, we need to follow the given steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station, making the total number of people on the bus 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of people on the bus is 2 * 90 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * $2 = $6 per year. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required for all groups to escape.

There are 3 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, making a total of 30 students. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we can form 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups. However, since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left.

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes to escape. The remaining 6 students will also take 45 minutes to escape.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

John has to pay Ali $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. 

We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds needed by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first express the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write the equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is 5 times the number of people, and each person gets 2 treats. Since there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes and brownies is 10.

We can write the equation:

C + B = 10

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost of both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both, we calculate the discount as 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, we need to add the cost of nail art for each nail. There are 10 nails (5 fingers and 5 toes), and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can represent Shelley's paintings as 'x + 8'. 

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can represent Samantha's paintings as '(x + 8) - 12'. 

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation: 

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get: 

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we need to find 25% of the standard rate:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's represent the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, we can substitute x with 20:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for Pomelos given away:

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total number of apples.

3/5 of 60 apples = (3/5) * 60 = 36 apples

Walter had 36 apples left. Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.

25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 apples * $3/apple = $81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he spent traveling. 

First, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total time:

Total distance covered = Average speed * Total time
Total distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Total distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage of distance covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage of distance covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage of distance covered = 60%

The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is: 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions). 
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correct.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass. 
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs to have 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. This means that for every 25 calls, 1 customer is generated. To get 30 customers, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights for each room and then add them up. Since there are 8 rooms and 2 flashlights per room, the total number of flashlights is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the total number of candles, we need to calculate the number of small candles and medium candles separately. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them will be 4 rooms and the other half will also be 4 rooms. 

The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16. The total number of medium candles is 5 * 4 = 20. 

The total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36.

So, Brianna's family is using 16 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To calculate the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to break down the time it takes for each side.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of robots and footballs. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:
Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 6 hours is equal to 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day: 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5: 24 * 5 = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

Time for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
Time for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining number of plants is 20 - 12 = 8.

Since the remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the total water needed for them as follows:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

The time it takes to hop on land is the distance divided by the speed, which is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time it takes to swim in the water is also 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of boxes Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks required by the number of sticks per box. 

Number of sticks per box = 8
Total sticks required = 56
Total boxes required = Total sticks required / Number of sticks per box
Total boxes required = 56 / 8
Total boxes required = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, the total cost will be the number of boxes multiplied by the cost per box.

Total cost = Total boxes required * Cost per box
Total cost = 7 * $2.00
Total cost = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

The cost of the four additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June and then multiply it by the selling price.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

There are 30 days in June, so the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick makes 3600 * 2 = $7200 in June."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Total number of photos = 210

Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To find the total cost of dry-cleaning Alicia's clothes for 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total cost for 5 weeks: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

The total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is $47.00."
"To find John's new speaking speed, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since John can speak 450 words per page, we need to find out how many words he can speak in 1 minute. 

1 minute = 60 seconds
1 minute = 60 seconds * 375 words/minute = 22,500 words/minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it would take John to speak 10 pages. 

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4,500 words
Time = Total words / words per minute = 4,500 words / 22,500 words/minute = 0.2 minutes

0.2 minutes = 0.2 * 60 seconds = 12 seconds

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

The rest of the week consists of 5 days, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. The total number of people on these 5 days is 5 * 60 = 300.

Now, we add up the number of people Conor saw on each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 360.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 360."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add the 10 kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total number of kernels that popped: 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 4 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons as follows:

4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups
4 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 4/6 * 6 = 4 lemons per gallon

Since Tim wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade (4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon), we multiply the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons by 5:

4 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 20 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups as follows:

2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Now, we add the number of lemons needed for the 5 regular gallons and the extra tart gallon:

20 lemons + 2 lemons = 22 lemons

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption of dog food is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. Since he traveled west for 5 hours and then east for 8 hours, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
For the westbound trip: Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
For the eastbound trip: Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house:

Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296."
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets: 
- 2 adult tickets = 2 * $12 = $24
- 1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of the popcorns: 
- 2 popcorns = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:
Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

The family pays $38 in total."
"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children. 

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs John will serve and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of children following the truck at each street.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making a total of 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making a total of 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we subtract them from the total: 60 - 5 = 55 children.

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) per day, 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per day = 30 minutes + 60 minutes = 90 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per day = 60 minutes
Total time spent on meditation and yoga per day = 90 minutes + 60 minutes = 150 minutes

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week = 150 minutes * 7 days = 1050 minutes

"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the cookies he ate, and then add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 
Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
Total cookies eaten = 3

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
Total cookies eaten = 3 + 2 = 5

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
Total cookies eaten = 5 + 2 = 7

Now, let's subtract the total cookies eaten from the initial total: 
18 - 7 = 11 cookies

Then, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
Total cookies baked = 4 * 3 = 12 cookies

Now, let's add the cookies baked to the remaining cookies: 
11 + 12 = 23 cookies

Randy now has 23 cookies."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate needs to fill.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation:

T + B + P = 29

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2).

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can find her time by dividing the distance by her speed: time = distance / speed = 4 / (x/2) = 8/x minutes.

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can find his distance by multiplying his speed by the time: distance = speed * time = x * 16 = 16x miles.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation: 2 * 16x = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know Aaron's speed is 1 mile per minute, we can find Vanessa's time: time = 8/x = 8/1 = 8 minutes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to first calculate the daily revenue. 

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine. The cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10, and the cost of the wine is $5. 

So, the daily revenue is 6 * ($10 + $5) = 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is 2 * $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total selling price and then divide it by the number of watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 

First, we need to find the total selling price. Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Cost price + (Cost price * Profit percentage)
= $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

The final answer is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son when he was 19, and that son is James. So, John's current age is 18 + 18 = 36 years.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. Since John is 36 now, his youngest son is 36 - 32 = 4 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges, and Jane will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

The labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost. 

Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230."
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2, which gives us 2c + 2b = 40. Subtracting this equation from the second equation, we get 2b = 30, which means b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into the first equation: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and 3 of his friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
