"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.

* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist must live in house number 4.

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.  

* **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's arrange the information:

* House 1:  ?
* House 2: Flutist
* House 3: ?
* House 4: Pianist

Since the tulips are left of the guitarist, and the guitarist can't be in house 4 (pianist is there), the guitarist must be in house 3. This puts the tulips in house 2.

* House 1: ?
* House 2: Tulips, Flutist
* House 3: Guitarist
* House 4: Pianist

Now, we know the lilies are left of the carnations. The only spot left for the lilies is house 1, and the carnations must be in house 2.

* House 1: Lilies
* House 2: Carnations, Tulips, Flutist
* House 3: Guitarist
* House 4: Pianist



**Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2. The answer is (A).**

"This is a classic logic puzzle!  While I can't ""solve"" it in the way a human might, I can help you break down the clues and use them to deduce the answer. 

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Organize the Information:** Create a table or chart with columns for House Number, Pet, Book, Lunch, Color, and Drink.

2. **Input the Clues:**  Carefully input each clue into your table. Some clues will directly tell you a placement (like the dog owner being in house 2), while others will give you relative positions (like the milk drinker being left of the blue lover).

3. **Look for Chains:** Clues often build on each other. For example, if you know the dog owner is next to the red lover, and the red lover is left of the spaghetti eater, you can start to build a chain of placements.

4. **Eliminate Possibilities:** As you place items, eliminate them as possibilities for other houses.

5. **Be Systematic:**  Go through the clues one by one, updating your table as you go.

Good luck! Let me know if you get stuck on a particular clue and I can try to help you interpret it.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

It's helpful to create a grid with the houses numbered 1 through 5, and columns for Car, Drink, Fruit, and Color.

**2. Fill in the Grid:**

Use the clues to fill in the grid. Here's how the clues translate:

* **Clue 1:** Tea drinker is not in house 1.
* **Clue 2:** Apples are in house 3.
* **Clue 3:** Red is not in house 3.
* **Clue 4:** Milk and Banana are next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** Water is directly left of Yellow.
* **Clue 6:** Two houses between Root Beer and Kiwis.
* **Clue 7:** Milk is in house 3.
* **Clue 8:** SUV is right of Milk.
* **Clue 9:** Red is left of Water.
* **Clue 10:** Convertible is left of Red.
* **Clue 11:** Blue is left of Truck.
* **Clue 12:** Mangos are left of Green.
* **Clue 13:** Sedan and Yellow are next to each other.

**3. Deduce and Solve:**

Carefully work through the clues, filling in the grid as you go. You'll need to use a combination of direct statements and deductions based on the relationships between the clues.

*For example:* Since Milk is in house 3, and Banana is next to Milk, Banana must be in house 2 or 4.

Continue this process, eliminating possibilities and confirming placements until you can determine where the Sedan is located.

"This puzzle requires careful deduction and logic. Unfortunately, I can't process and analyze the clues in the way a human can to arrive at the solution. I'm designed for generating text, translating languages, and writing different kinds of creative content, not solving logic puzzles. 

To solve this, you'd want to use a grid or chart to keep track of the clues and eliminate possibilities. 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

This means the person in the second house likes history and has daffodils.

* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

**2. Use the clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Since the third house has loafers, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the second house. This also means the person who likes yellow and wears boots must be in the first house.

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the second house has daffodils, the lilies must be in the third house, and the science fiction fan must be in the first house.

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house. This confirms our placement of the yellow-liking, boot-wearing person in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house. This confirms our placement.

**3.  Deduce the remaining information:**

We know the following:

* House 1: Yellow, Boots, Science Fiction
* House 2: Blue, Daffodils, History
* House 3: Green, Loafers, Lilies 


**Answer:** The person who likes green lives in **(A) 1**.

* **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. 

**3.  Deduce the rest:**

* Since the cricketer is in house 1, and the truck driver is to the right of the basketball player, the basketball player cannot be in house 3.
*  Therefore, the basketball player must be in **House 2**.


**Answer:** (B) 2

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Tea drinker 

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 2:** Apples are to the left of the minivan.
* **Clue 3:** Convertible is to the right of the science fiction fan.
* **Clue 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast and coffee drinker have one house between them.
* **Clue 5:** Oranges are not in House 2.

**3.  Deduce:**

* Since the tea drinker is in House 1, and apples are to the left of the minivan, the minivan cannot be in House 1.
*  Because the convertible is to the right of the science fiction fan, the science fiction fan cannot be in House 3.

**4. Consider possibilities:**

Let's try placing the fantasy book enthusiast in House 2. This would put the coffee drinker in House 3 (due to Clue 4).

* This arrangement works with all the clues.

**Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in House 3. The answer is (A).** 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 4** tells us the person who likes red lives in the second house.
* **Clue 1** says the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader, meaning the mystery book reader must be in the third house.
* **Clue 3** tells us the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house.

Since the second house is taken by the red lover and the third house by the mystery reader, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

* **Clue 2** says the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. 

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the **second house**.

**So the answer is (B) 2.** 



"
"The answer is **(A) 3**. 

Clue number 5 states: ""The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house."" 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information with a grid:

| House | Fruit | Flowers | Instrument | Drink | Device |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 1 & 4:** The person with the television lives directly left of the tea drinker and the guitarist. This means they must be in house 1, the tea drinker in house 2, and the guitarist in house 3.

| House | Fruit | Flowers | Instrument | Drink | Device |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  | Television |
| 2 |  |  |  | Tea |  |
| 3 |  |  | Guitarist |  |  |

* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker doesn't live in the second house.  We already placed them in house 2, so this clue is redundant.

* **Clue 2:** The kiwi eater lives to the right of the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker can't be in house 3.

* **Clue 5:** The flutist and banana eater have one house between them. This gives us a few possibilities, but we'll explore them later.

* **Clue 6:** The tulip holder lives to the right of the radio owner.

* **Clue 7:** The rose bouquet is in house 2.

| House | Fruit | Flowers | Instrument | Drink | Device |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  | Television |
| 2 |  | Rose |  | Tea |  |
| 3 |  |  | Guitarist |  |  |

**3. Deduce:**

* Since the tea drinker is in house 2, and the television is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

*  Knowing the kiwi eater is to the right of the coffee drinker, the kiwi eater must be in house 3 as well.

* The flutist and banana eater have one house between them, and we know the flutist can't be in house 3 (kiwi eater is there). This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the banana eater in house 2.

| House | Fruit | Flowers | Instrument | Drink | Device |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

"The dog owner lives in **house number 2**. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. This means the cellist is in house 1 and the gameboy owner is in house 2.
* **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house. Since the first house has the cellist, the dog owner must be in the second house. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Minivan
* **House 3:** Gameboy

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 3:** Phone is directly left of SUV. This means the SUV can't be in house 1 (minivan is there) and can't be in house 3 (gameboy is there).
* **Clue 4:** Radio is to the right of the Gameboy. This means the radio must be in house 4.
* **Clue 5:** Convertible is not in house 3.

**3. Deduce:**

* Since the SUV can't be in houses 1 or 3, and the radio is in house 4, the **SUV must be in house 2**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information. Create a grid with ""House Number"" (1-5) as columns and ""Device"" and ""Flower"" as rows.

**2. Fill in the knowns:**

* **Clue 3:** Tulips are in house #3.
* **Clue 6:** Computer is in house #2.

**3. Use the clues to deduce:**

* **Clue 2:** Phone is left of Television.
* **Clue 1:** Lilies are right of Phone.
* **Clue 7:** Rose is left of Carnations.
* **Clue 4:** Daffodils are right of Radio.
* **Clue 5:** Daffodils are not in house #4.

**4.  Combine clues and deduce:**

Since the phone is left of the television, and lilies are right of the phone, the order must be Phone - Lilies - Television.

We know tulips are in house #3, and the computer is in house #2.  This means the phone must be in house #1, lilies in #2, and television in #3.

The rose must be left of the carnations, and daffodils are right of the radio.  Since daffodils can't be in house #4, they must be in house #5. This means the radio is in house #4.

This leaves us with:

* House 1: Phone
* House 2: Computer, Lilies
* House 3: Tulips, Television
* House 4: Radio
* House 5: Daffodils, Rose, Carnations

**Answer:** The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house **(E) 5**.

* **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in house 4.
* **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in house 1.
* **Clue 7:** The person wearing loafers lives next to the cricketer (house 2), so they must be in house 3.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the bird keeper (house 1) and the person wearing sandals. This means the person wearing sandals lives in house 3.
* **Clue 9 & 4:** The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in houses 4 or 5.

* **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives to the right of the person wearing sandals (house 3), so they must be in house 4 or 5.
* **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives to the right of the golfer (house 4), so they must be in house 5.
* **Clue 12:** There's one house between the horse owner and the person wearing boots.  

**3. Deduce the Rest:**

Now we can deduce the rest:

* Since the golfer is in house 4, the cat lover is in house 5, and the baseball player is in house 5, the horse owner must be in house 2 and the person wearing boots in house 3.
* The only remaining sport is basketball, and the only remaining shoes are high heels.

**4. Find the Dog Owner:**

Looking at our completed grid, we can see that the dog owner lives in **house 3**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Combine Clues:**

* **Clue 1 & 2:** The radio owner and truck driver are neighbors, and the radio owner is left of the pizza eater. This means the order must be Radio - Truck - Pizza (or Pizza - Truck - Radio, but we'll explore the first option first).

* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover doesn't live in house 1.

* **Clue 4:** The grape eater is directly left of the computer owner.

**2.  Possible Scenarios:**

Let's try placing the information we have:

* **Scenario 1:**

   House 1:  Radio - Truck

   This scenario doesn't work because the grape eater needs to be left of the computer owner.

* **Scenario 2:**

   House 1:  Truck - Radio
   House 2:  Pizza - Computer

   This scenario fits all the clues!

**3. Solution:**

Since the pizza eater is in House 2, the answer is **(A) 2**.

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

**3. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. This means they can't be next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

**4. Deduce:**

Since the violinist can't be in the fourth house and the pizza eater is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in house 1, 2, or 3.  The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the guitarist could be in house 1.

Now, consider the percussionist and science fiction fan. The percussionist is to the right of the science fiction fan.  Since the violinist is in house 1, 2, or 3, and the percussionist is to the right of the science fiction fan, the science fiction fan can't be in house 4.

* The cricketer is in the fourth house, so they must be wearing the running shoes.
* The basketball player and baseball player are next to each other, and we know the cricketer is in the fourth house. This means the basketball player must be in the third house and the baseball player in the second.
* The violinist is in the second house, so the baseball player must be the one wearing high heels.
* The sandals are to the left of the tulips, and we know the cricketer is in the fourth house. This means the sandals must be in the first house.

**Therefore, the person wearing sandals lives in house number 1. The answer is (E).** 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2** tells us the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 1** tells us the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the fish enthusiast. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels and the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast.

* This means the person who ate stew must live in **house 1**.


**So the answer is (A).** 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

It's helpful to create a grid with the houses numbered 1 through 5, and columns for each characteristic (book type, pet, color, flower).

* **Clue 12:** Mystery book reader is left of the blue lover.

This gives us:

| House | Book        | Pet        | Color | Flower      |

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person with the phone lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 6:** The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
* **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clues 2, 4, and 6:** Since the phone, flutist, and running shoes are all in the third house, they must belong to the same person.

* **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other. Since the running shoes are in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

* **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the romance book lover is in the first house.

* **Clue 1:** The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live directly next to each other.

* **Clue 5:** The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots.

* **Clue 11:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges.

**3. Deduce the remaining information:**

* Combining clues 1, 5, and 11, we can deduce the following order: history book buff -  person eating grapes - person eating oranges.

* Since the person with the phone, flutist, and running shoes are in the third house, and the percussionist is in the fourth, the first two houses must contain the history book buff, the person eating grapes, and the person eating oranges.

*  Clue 8 tells us the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house, so they must be in the second house.

* Clue 13 tells us the person eating kiwis doesn't live in the first house, so they must be in the second house as well.

* Clue 12 tells us the person with the radio doesn't live in the second house, so they must be in the first house.

* Clue 9 tells us the person with the gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist, so they must be in the fourth house.

* This leaves the boots for the first house.



**Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in house number 3.**

**Answer: (D) 3**

| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |

**Using the Clues:**

1. **Root beer and Milk:** Live next to each other.
2. **Pizza and Tea:** Pizza is left of Tea.
3. **Pizza and Grilled Cheese:** Two houses between them.
4. **Red and Yellow:** One house between them.
5. **Mangos and Oranges:** One house between them.
6. **Pizza and Yellow:** Pizza is left of Yellow.
7. **Oranges and Apples:** Oranges are left of Apples.
8. **Stew:** Not in house 3.
9. **Stew and Water:** Stew is left of Water.
10. **White:** Right of Stew.
11. **Apples and Pizza:** Apples are right of Pizza.

**Deductions:**

* **Combining clues 2, 6, and 11:** We know Pizza is left of Yellow and Apples are right of Pizza. This means the order must be Pizza - Yellow - Apples.

* **Combining clues 7 and 11:** Oranges are left of Apples, and Apples are right of Pizza. This means the order must be Oranges - Pizza - Yellow - Apples.

* **Clue 3:** There are two houses between the Root Beer lover and the Grilled Cheese eater. This means they can't be next to each other.

* **Clue 9:** Stew is left of Water.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| House | Color | Lunch | Fruit | Drink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  | Stew | Oranges |  |
| 2 |  |  | Pizza |  |
| 3 |  |  | Yellow |  |
| 4 |  |  | Apples |  |

We know the order of Fruits and can place Stew and Pizza.

* **Clue 1:** Root Beer and Milk live next to each other.

Let's try placing them:

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  | Stew | Oranges |  |
| 2 |  |  | Pizza | Root Beer |
| 3 |  |  | Yellow | Milk |
| 4 |  |  | Apples |  |

* **Clue 10:** White lives to the right of Stew. This means White can only be in house 4.

| House | Color | Lunch | Fruit | Drink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  | Stew | Oranges |  |
| 2 |  |  | Pizza | Root Beer |
| 3 |  |  | Yellow | Milk |
| 4 | White |  | Apples |  |

Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest.

* **Clue 8:** Stew is not in house 3. (Already satisfied)
* **Clue 4:** One house between Red and Yellow. This means Red must be in house 1.
* **Clue 5:** One house between Mangos and Oranges. This means Mangos must be in house 2.

| House | Color | Lunch | Fruit | Drink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Red | Stew | Oranges |  |
| 2 |  |  | Pizza | Root Beer |
| 3 |  |  | Yellow | Milk |
| 4 | White |  | Apples |  |

Finally, we can deduce the rest:

| House | Color | Lunch | Fruit | Drink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Red | Stew | Oranges | Tea |
| 2 | Blue | Grilled Cheese | Pizza | Root Beer |
| 3 | Yellow |  | Yellow | Milk |
| 4 | White |  | Apples | Water |

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other. Since green is in house 3, yellow must be in house 2.

**3.  Use the remaining clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.

**4. Deduce the rest:**

* Since yellow is in house 2, and grilled cheese isn't there, grilled cheese must be in house 1.
* This means stew is in house 1 (because it's to the left of the romance lover).
* The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3 (to the right of stew).
* This leaves blue for house 1.


**Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1. The answer is (C).**

* The fish enthusiast can't be in Houses 3, 4, or 5, leaving Houses 1 or 2.
* The SUV must be in House 2 (to have the fish enthusiast to the right).
* This means the fish enthusiast is in House 1.
* The horse owner must be to the right of the minivan owner, and since the minivan can't be in House 5 (loafers are not there), the minivan must be in House 2, and the horse owner in House 5.

**4. Solution:**

The person who owns horses lives in **House 5 (E)**. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses numbered 1 through 5, and then list the categories (flowers, cars, fruit, pets, shoes) as columns.

**2. Fill in the Grid Using the Clues:**

Let's go through the clues one by one and fill in the grid:

* **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
* **Clue 10:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
* **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
* **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.

Our grid now looks like this:

| House | Flowers | Car        | Fruit | Pet      | Shoes      |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1     |         | Convertible |       | Bird Keeper |            |

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 3** tells us the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
* **Clue 4** tells us the fantasy book enthusiast also lives in the second house. 

Since only one person can live in each house, this means the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

* **Clue 1** says the spaghetti eater lives to the left of the fried rice eater. This means the spaghetti eater must live in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** says the science fiction fan lives to the left of the fried rice eater.  

This means the science fiction fan must live in house number 1.

*  We know houses 1 and 2 are filled, so the grilled cheese eater must live in house number **3**.


**Answer: (C) 3** 

"
"The answer is **(B) 1**. 

Here's why:

* We know the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. 
* Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, the only way this is possible is if the person with carnations is in house number 1. 



"

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in house number 2.

* **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.

* **Combining the clues:**  Since the bird keeper can't be in house 2, and the percussionist can't be in house 2, the guitarist must live in house 2.

* **Deduction:** This means the percussionist lives in house 1. Since the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater in house 2.

* **Final Answer:**  The person who had pizza must live in **house 1**. 

**So the answer is (B).**

**3. Combine the clues:**

Since the fish enthusiast is to the right of the banana eater and the flutist is to the right of the fish enthusiast, they must be in houses 2 and 3. This means the banana eater must be in house 1.

* **House 1:** Cat lover, Banana eater
* **House 2:**  
* **House 3:** 

**4. More deductions:**

* The orange eater is to the right of the pianist, and the only spot left for the orange eater is house 3. This means the pianist must be in house 2.

* **House 1:** Cat lover, Banana eater
* **House 2:** Pianist
* **House 3:** Orange eater

**5. Final touches:**

* We know the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the flutist, and the only spot left for the fantasy book enthusiast is house 1.
* This leaves the flutist in house 3.

* **House 1:** Cat lover, Banana eater, Fantasy book enthusiast
* **House 2:** Pianist
* **House 3:** Orange eater, Flutist

**6. The answer:**

We've determined the positions of all but the science fiction book fanatic. Since the other two book lovers are in houses 1 and 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live in **House 3**.



**Therefore, the answer is (C).**

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Mangos 

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 2:** Horses are not in House 1.

* **Clue 3:** Bird keeper and Kiwi eater are next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** Banana eater is to the left of the Dog owner.

**3.  Consider the possibilities:**

Since we know Mangos are in House 1, let's try placing the other elements:

* **Scenario 1:**  If Horses are in House 3, then the Bird keeper and Kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 4 (to be next to each other). This would leave House 4 for the Banana eater and Dog owner, which doesn't fit Clue 6.

* **Scenario 2:** If Horses are in House 4, then the Bird keeper and Kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 3. This allows for the Banana eater to be in House 2 and the Dog owner in House 3, satisfying Clue 6.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Combine the Clues:**

* **Clue 1 & 3:**  Tell us that the person eating grapes lives in house 1 (left) and the person driving the truck lives in house 2 (right).

* **Clue 2:** Tells us the person wearing boots lives in house 1 (left) and the mystery book reader lives in house 2 (right).

**2. Deduce:**

* Since the person in house 1 eats grapes and wears boots, they must like red (the other color) and drive the convertible (the other car).

* Since the person in house 2 drives the truck, they must like yellow, eat oranges, and be the mystery book reader.

**3. Solution:**

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to be in **house 1**.


**Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.**

"This is a classic logic puzzle!  Let's break down the clues to figure out where the fried rice eater lives. 

Unfortunately, I can't actually *solve* the puzzle for you. I can only process information and follow instructions, not deduce solutions to complex logic problems.

To solve this, you'd need to carefully map out the clues, perhaps using a grid or chart to keep track of the information. 

Good luck with the puzzle!

"The answer is **(A) center midfielder**. Here's how we figure that out:

"
"The answer is **(A) right midfielder**. Here's how we figure that out:

1. **Start:** Claire is a benchwarmer.

2. **Trades:** Claire only trades positions with Dave at the very end.

3. **Dave's Journey:** Dave starts as a cheerleader, then trades with Gertrude (right winger), Fred (right midfielder), Alice (left midfielder), Gertrude (right winger again), Alice (left midfielder again), and finally Claire.

4. **Conclusion:** Since Dave ends up as a benchwarmer after trading with Claire, Claire must have taken his previous position, which was right midfielder.
