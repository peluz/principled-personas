"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.

* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.  

* **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's consider the possibilities:

* **If the pianist is in house 1:** This would put the guitarist in house 3, the tulips in house 2, and the lilies in house 1. This arrangement works with all the clues.

* **If the pianist is in house 3:** This would put the guitarist in house 1, the tulips in house 4, and the lilies in house 3. This doesn't work because the flutist is in house 2.

**Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 2.**

**Answer: (A)**

"Here's how we can deduce the cellist's house number:

1. **Start with the knowns:**

   - House 1: Green lover, Kiwi eater
   -  Root beer lover is to the right of the person who drinks water.
   - The person with the television is to the left of the root beer lover.

2. **Combine clues:**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.

This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are the same person, and they live in house number 3.

* **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.

**2. Use the clues about positioning:**

* **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
* **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

**3. Combine the information:**

Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the green lover, and there are two houses between the white lover and the coffee drinker, the possible scenarios are:

* **Scenario 1:** Green - White -  _ - Coffee
* **Scenario 2:** White - Green - _ - Coffee

We know the root beer lover (red lover) is in house 3. This eliminates Scenario 1.

**4.  More positioning clues:**

* **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

This means they must be in houses 2 and 1, or houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is taken, they must be in houses 2 and 1.

This means the tea drinker must live in house 4.

**5. Final Deduction:**

We now have:

* House 1: Romance book lover

* House 3: Root beer lover (Red lover)
* House 4: Tea drinker

Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the green lover, and the only remaining spot is house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house **4**.

* Combining these, a possible sequence is Pizza - Tulips - Grilled Cheese - Stew.

* Clue 1 tells us Roses are left of Grilled Cheese, so the sequence becomes Pizza - Tulips - Roses - Grilled Cheese - Stew.

* Clue 2 says Oranges are left of Apples, and clue 9 says there are two houses between them. This means a possible arrangement is Oranges -  _ - Apples - _ - _.

* Clue 10 says Oranges are right of Carnations, so the arrangement becomes Carnations - Oranges - _ - Apples - _.

* Clue 11 says Apples are left of Mangos, completing the fruit sequence: Carnations - Oranges - Apples - Mangos - _.

* Finally, clue 5 tells us Daffodils are not in house 5, so they must be in house 1.

* **House 2:** Computer, ?, Pizza
* **House 3:** Phone, Blue, ?

We know the mango eater is left of the yellow lover, and the only spot left for them is in house 2. This means the yellow lover is in house 3.

Since the grape eater is right of the boots wearer, and the only spot left for the boots wearer is house 1, the grape eater must be in house 2. This leaves the apples for house 3.

**Therefore, the green lover must be in house 2.**

"Here's how we can deduce the answer:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

This means the person in the second house likes history and has daffodils.

* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

These clues, combined with the knowledge that the third house has loafers, mean the following arrangement is possible:

* House 1:  High heels, Yellow, ?
* House 2: Daffodils, History, Blue
* House 3: Loafers, ?, ?

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.

This means the person who likes yellow must be in the second house. Since the second house already has daffodils, the yellow-liking person must like science fiction.

**3. Final Deduction:**

Our arrangement now looks like this:

* House 1: High heels, Yellow, Science Fiction
* House 2: Daffodils, History, Blue
* House 3: Loafers, ?, ?

The only color left is green, and the only house left is the first. 


**Therefore, the person who likes green lives in house number (A) 1.**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses (1-5) as columns and the categories (device, pet, instrument, car, flower) as rows.

**2.  Use the Clues:**

Carefully go through each clue and fill in the grid. Some clues directly tell you where someone lives (like clue 4), while others give you relative positions (like clue 1).

**3. Look for Chains:**

Many clues link items together. For example, clue 8 tells us the rose bouquet is left of the daffodils. Look for these chains to help you fill in more of the grid.

**4. Process of Elimination:**

* **Clue 7:** Running shoes are in house 2.
* **Clue 8:** Convertible is left of water drinker.
* **Clue 9:** Spaghetti eater is NOT in house 1.

**3. Deductions:**

Now we can start making deductions based on the clues and the grid:

* **From Clue 7:** We know house 2 has running shoes.
* **From Clue 4:** House 3 has the milk drinker.
* **From Clue 6:** Since there are two houses between the sedan and water drinker, the sedan can't be in houses 1 or 4.

* **Let's try placing the sedan in house 2:** This would put the water drinker in house 4.  But Clue 8 says the convertible is left of the water drinker, which wouldn't work.

* **Therefore, the sedan must be in house 3.** This puts the water drinker in house 1.

**4. Continue Filling the Grid:**

Using the remaining clues and our deductions, we can continue filling in the grid.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses (1-5) as columns and the characteristics (pet, sport, shoes) as rows.

**2. Fill in the Obvious:**

* **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish Enthusiast (from clues 1 and 5)
* **House 4:** Golfer (from clue 2)
* **House 1:** Bird Keeper (from clue 6)

**3. Use Connecting Clues:**

* **Clue 7:** The person wearing loafers lives next to the cricketer (house 2). So, the loafers must be in house 1 or 3.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the bird keeper (house 1) and the sandals. This means the sandals are in house 3.
* **Clue 3:** The tennis player is to the left of the sandals. So, the tennis player must be in house 2.
* **Clue 10:** The baseball player is to the right of the sandals. This means the baseball player is in house 4 or 5.

* The horse owner must be in house 2 (next to the boots in house 3).
* The cat lover must be to the right of the golfer, so they must be in house 5.
* This leaves the dog owner to be in house 5. 



**Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 5. The answer is (B).**

"Here's how we can deduce the answer:

* **Clue 1:** The radio and truck owners are neighbors.
* **Clue 2:** The radio owner is to the left of the pizza eater.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover is in house number 2.
* **Clue 4:** The grape eater is to the left of the computer owner.

**Reasoning:**

1. Since the radio owner is left of the pizza eater, and the radio and truck owners are neighbors, the possible arrangements are:

   * Radio - Truck - Pizza 
   * Pizza - Radio - Truck

2. We know the root beer lover is in house number 2. This eliminates the first arrangement possibility.

3. Therefore, the arrangement must be: Pizza - Radio - Truck.

4.  Since the grape eater is left of the computer owner, the final arrangement is:

   * **Pizza - Radio - Truck - Grapes - Computer**

**Answer:** The person who had pizza lives in **house number 1 (A)**.

**2.  Use connecting clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.

These clues tell us the order must be: Milk - Spaghetti - Water

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means the white and water drinkers are in houses 3 and 4 (in some order).

**3.  Fill in the gaps:**

* We know houses 1 and 2 are taken (tea and pizza).
* We know milk, spaghetti, and water are in houses 3 and 4.
* This leaves the coffee drinker to be in house 3 or 4.
* **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the coffee drinker must be in house 3, and the yellow lover is in house 4.

**4. Final Deduction:**

* We've placed everyone except the green lover.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses (1-5) as columns and the characteristics (drink, fruit, shoes, sport, flowers) as rows.

**2.  Use the Clues:**

Carefully go through each clue and fill in the grid. Some clues directly tell you where someone lives (like clue 11), while others give you relative positions (like clue 1).

**3. Look for Chains:**

Many clues link characteristics together. For example, clue 8 tells us the coffee drinker is left of the sandal wearer. Look for these chains to help you fill in more of the grid.

**4. Process of Elimination:**

As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities. If you know someone lives in house 3, you can eliminate them as a possibility for all other houses.

**5.  Be Systematic:**

Don't jump around randomly. Work through the clues methodically.

I'll let you work through the puzzle using these steps. Good luck!

"Here's how we can deduce the dog owner's house number:

* **Clue 1:** The pianist lives in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the horse owner cannot be in the second house (since there's no one to their right).
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives in the second house.

**2. Use positional clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

**3. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. This means they can't be next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

**4. Deduce:**

Since the violinist can't be in the fourth house and the pizza eater is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in house 1, 2, or 3.  The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the guitarist could be in house 1.

Now, consider the percussionist and science fiction fan. The percussionist is to the right of the science fiction fan.  Since the violinist is likely in house 1, 2, or 3, the percussionist and science fiction fan can't be in houses 1 or 2. This means the science fiction fan must be in house 3 and the percussionist in house **4**.

**Therefore, the answer is (C) 4.**

* Since boots are in house 1, and there are two houses between the radio and sandals, the radio must be in house 3, and the sandals must be in house 4.
* This leaves house 1 for the gameboy.

**Therefore, the person with the gameboy lives in house 1. The answer is (C).** 



"
"The answer is **(B) 2**. 

Clue 1 directly states that the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. 



"
"The person wearing loafers lives in **house number 2**. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Clue 1** tells us the loafer wearer doesn't live in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** tells us the mystery book reader doesn't live in house number 2.

Since there are only two houses, and the loafer wearer can't be in house 1, they must be in house 2.

"Here's how we can deduce the answer:

* **Clue 3** tells us the mango eater lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** tells us the saxophonist doesn't live in house number 1.
* **Clue 1** tells us the roses are to the left of the lilies.  

Since house 1 has the mango eater, and the roses must be to the left of the lilies, the lilies must be in house number 2. This also means the saxophonist lives in house number 2.

Since the mango eater is in house 1, and they are eating a different fruit than the person in house 2, the person in house 2 must be eating apples.

**Let's start filling in the grid:**

We can start by combining clues 1 and 3. Since the computer is left of the root beer lover, and the root beer lover and coffee drinker are next to each other, we get a sequence like this:

... Computer - Root Beer - Coffee ...

Now, let's look at clue 14. There's one house between daffodils and coffee. This means the daffodils must be to the left of the sequence above:

... Daffodils - Computer - Root Beer - Coffee ...

**Continue using the clues to fill in the rest of the grid. Remember to consider the ""not"" clues as well.**

By carefully working through the clues and eliminating possibilities, you'll be able to determine the house number where the person with the carnations arrangement lives.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in house number 2.

* **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.

* **Combining the clues:** Since the bird keeper can't be in house 2, and the percussionist can't be in house 2, the guitarist must live in house 2.

* **Deduction:**  Because the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, and the guitarist is in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1. This leaves house 1 for the pizza eater.


**Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house number (B) 1.**

* **Clue 5:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.

**2.  Use the clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 1:** The person eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red. Since red is in the second house, grapes must be in the third house.

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses numbered 1 through 5.  Then create columns for each characteristic (fruit, instrument, shoes, color, book).

**2.  Use the Clues:**

Carefully go through each clue and fill in the grid. Some clues directly tell you where someone lives (like clue 12), while others give you relative positions (like clue 1).

**3. Look for Chains:**

Often, clues will create chains of information. For example, if you know the green lover is left of the blue lover, and the blue lover is right of the orange eater, you can deduce the order of those three.

**4. Process of Elimination:**

As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities. If you know someone can't be in a certain house, mark it off.

**5.  Repeat:**

Keep going through the clues and updating your grid until you have enough information to determine the answer.

* **Clue 2:** The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the first house is the cat lover, and the second house is the boots wearer, the high heels wearer must be in the first house and the dog owner in the second.

**Therefore:**

* House 1: Cat lover, SUV, High Heels
* House 2: Dog owner, Boots 
* House 3: Sedan, Running Shoes 

**Answer:** The person wearing running shoes lives in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Here's how we can deduce the answer:

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with carnations lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person with tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

This tells us the following setup so far:

* House 1: Carnations, Running Shoes
* House 2: Tulips
* House 3: Tea

* **Clue 2:** The kiwi eater lives directly left of the blue lover. This means they can't be in house 3 (tea drinker)

* **Clue 3:** The milk drinker and apple eater are next to each other.

* **Clue 6:** The boots wearer is directly left of the green lover.

* **Clue 8:** The orange eater doesn't live in house 3.

**Putting it all together:**

Since the kiwi eater is left of the blue lover, and the orange eater isn't in house 3, the only possible arrangement is:

* House 1: Carnations, Running Shoes, Milk,  
* House 2: Tulips, Boots, Green, Kiwis
* House 3: Tea, High Heels, Blue, Oranges, Apples 


**Therefore, the person eating apples lives in house 3. The answer is (A).** 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2** tells us the mystery book reader lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 1** says the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff, so the history book buff must be in house number 2.
* **Clue 4** states the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with the television, meaning the person with the television is in house number 2.
* **Clue 3** tells us the computer owner is to the right of the phone owner.  

Since the mystery book reader (house 1) is left of the history book buff (house 2) and the television (house 2), the phone must be in house 3. This leaves the computer for house 3 as well.

* **Therefore, by process of elimination, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 3.**
