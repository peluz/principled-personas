"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.

* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.  

* **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's consider the possibilities:

* **If the pianist is in house 1:** This would put the guitarist in house 3, the tulips in house 2, and the lilies in house 1. This works with all the clues.

* **If the pianist is in house 3:** This scenario doesn't work because it would place the tulips before the lilies, contradicting clue 3.

**Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 2. The answer is (A).**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.

This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are the same person, and they live in house number 3.

* **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.

**2. Use clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
* **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

These clues tell us the coffee drinker can't be in house 1.

* **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

This means they must be in consecutive houses.

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.

**3. Deduce the remaining positions:**

Since the coffee drinker is to the right of the green lover, and the root beer lover (red lover) is in house 3, the green lover must be in house 1.

Knowing the romance and history lovers are together, and they can't be in the first or fourth house, they must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the coffee drinker is to the right of the green lover, and there are two houses between them, the coffee drinker must be in house **4**.

**Therefore, the answer is (B) 4.**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house, meaning they must live in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.
* **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the first house is already filled, this means the person who likes green lives in the first house and the person with the radio lives in the second.

**Putting it all together:**

* House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, likes green,  (we don't know about the device or food yet)
* House 2: Fish enthusiast, has a radio, ate pizza (we don't know about the book type or color)

"
"This puzzle requires logic and deduction, not hunting expertise.  I can help you solve it! 

Let's break down the clues and create a grid to keep track of the information. This type of puzzle is best solved visually. 

Unfortunately, I can't create a visual grid in this text-based format. However, I can guide you through the process:

1. **Set up a Grid:** Draw a grid with 5 columns (for the houses) and rows for each characteristic (pet, book, lunch, color, drink).

2. **Fill in the Obvious:** Start by filling in the grid with any direct information from the clues. For example, you know the dog owner lives in house #2.

3. **Use Clues to Deduce:**  Carefully analyze the clues that relate positions. For example, clue #2 tells you the milk drinker is to the left of the blue lover.  

4. **Eliminate Possibilities:** As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities for other houses.

5. **Look for Chains:**  Clues often create chains of information. For example, if you know the bird keeper is left of the history buff, and the history buff is left of the fish enthusiast, you can start to build a sequence.

Continue this process of filling, deducing, eliminating, and chaining until you can determine the house number of the person who drinks only water.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Cat lover 
* **Clue 5** tells us this.

**2. Use the clues to fill in more:**

* **Clue 1:** Tulips are left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 4:** Lilies are right of the horse owner.

**3. Consider the possibilities:**

Since we know the cat lover is in house 1, and tulips are to the left of the dog owner, the dog owner can't be in house 2.  

* **Clue 2:** Daffodils are not in house 2.

This means the daffodils must be in either house 3 or 4.

* **Clue 3:** One house between horses and carnations.

This limits the possible arrangements.

**4. Deduce the solution:**

Let's try placing the horses in house 2. This would put the carnations in house 3 or 4.  Since daffodils can't be in house 2, they must be in house 4. This leaves house 3 for the lilies.

This arrangement satisfies all the clues.

* **House 1:** Cat lover
* **House 2:** Horses
* **House 3:** Lilies
* **House 4:** Daffodils, Fish enthusiast 



**Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in house 4. The answer is (D).**

* **Clue 3:** The horse owner and the person with the radio live next to each other. Since the phone is in house 1, the radio must be in house 2, and the horse owner must be in house 1.

Since the person in boots is in house 1, and the horse owner is also in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in **house number 2**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 2:** Baseball player

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 2:** Basketball player is left of the swimmer.
* **Clue 3:**  Baseball player is in house 2.

This means the basketball player can't be in house 1 (clue 1) and must be in house 1.

* **Clue 6:** Tennis player is directly left of the cat lover.

* **Clue 4:** Fish enthusiast is right of the dog owner.

* **Clue 5 & 7:** Bird keeper is not in houses 1, 3.

**3. Deduce the rest:**

Since the basketball player is in house 1 and the baseball player is in house 2, the only remaining spots for the swimmer and tennis player/cat lover pair are houses 3 and 4.

Because the tennis player is directly left of the cat lover, they must be in house 3 and the cat lover in house 4.

This leaves the fish enthusiast and dog owner. Since the fish enthusiast is right of the dog owner, the dog owner must be in house 3 and the fish enthusiast in house 4.

This leaves the bird keeper for **house 2**.

| 4     |          | White   |              |
| 5     |          | Blue    |              |

* **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
* **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the order must be: Loafers - Truck - Sandals

Let's add this to our table:

| House | Car      | Color   | Shoes        |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1     |          |         |              |
| 2     |          |         | Loafers      |
| 3     |          |         |              |
| 4     |          | White   |              |
| 5     |          | Blue    | Sandals      |

* **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.

This confirms our placement so far.

* **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
* **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the minivan and the person who likes green must be on either side of the truck.

Let's try placing them:

| House | Car      | Color   | Shoes        |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1     |          |         |              |
| 2     |          |         | Loafers      |
| 3     | Minivan  | Green   |              |
| 4     | Truck    | White   |              |
| 5     |          | Blue    | Sandals      |

* **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

This means the sedan and running shoes must be on opposite ends of the remaining houses.

Let's try this:

| House | Car      | Color   | Shoes        |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1     | Sedan    |         | Running Shoes |
| 2     |          |         | Loafers      |
| 3     | Minivan  | Green   |              |
| 4     | Truck    | White   |              |
| 5     | SUV      | Blue    | Sandals      |

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

We can now deduce the final placements:

| House | Car      | Color   | Shoes        |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1     | Sedan    | Yellow  | Running Shoes |
| 2     |          |         | Loafers      |
| 3     | Minivan  | Green   |              |
| 4     | Truck    | White   |              |
| 5     | SUV      | Blue    | Sandals      |

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

This means the person in the second house likes history and has daffodils.

* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

**2. Use the clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Since the third house has loafers, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the second house. This also means the person who likes yellow and wears boots must be in the first house.

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the second house has daffodils, the lilies must be in the third house, and the science fiction fan must be in the first house.

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house. This confirms our placement of yellow in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house. This confirms our placement of yellow in the first house.

**3.  Deduce the remaining information:**

We know the first house has yellow, boots, and a science fiction book lover. The second house has blue, daffodils, and a history book buff. The third house has green, lilies, and loafers.



**Therefore, the person who likes green lives in house number (A) 1.**

* **Clue 3** tells us the person who ate spaghetti lives in house #1.
* **Clue 1** tells us the person who ate fried rice does *not* live in house #2.
* **Clue 2** tells us the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.  

Since the spaghetti eater is in house #1, and the fried rice eater isn't in house #2, the fried rice eater must be in house #3. This means the boots wearer is in house #2.

* **Clue 4** tells us the person wearing loafers doesn't live in house #1.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in **house #2**. 

**So the answer is (A).**

"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **house number 2**. 

Here's why:

* **Clue 1** tells us the mystery book reader lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** tells us the tennis player does *not* live in house number 1. 

Since there are only two houses, and the mystery book reader is in house 1, the tennis player must be in house 2. This leaves house 2 for the fantasy book enthusiast. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

Let's represent each house with a number 1 through 4. We'll use the clues to fill in a table:

| House | Instrument | Shoes      | Lunch      | Flowers      | Color |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1     |            |            |            |              |       |
| 2     |            |            |            |              |       |
| 3     |            |            |            |              |       |
| 4     |            | Loafers    |            |              |       |

**Using the Clues:**

1. **Sandals left of Spaghetti:**  _ _ S _ 
2. **Stew left of Spaghetti:**  _ S S _
3. **Rose not in House 1:**  _ _ _ _
4. **Running Shoes left of Daffodils:** _ R D _
5. **Pizza and Daffodils together:** _ R D P
6. **White right of Running Shoes:** _ R D P W
7. **Lilies left of Guitarist:** _ L G _
8. **Daffodils not in House 3:** _ R D P W
9. **Two houses between Green and Pianist:** This means they can't be next to each other.
10. **Green left of Pianist:**  _ G _ P
11. **Blue left of Pizza:** B _ D P W
12. **Lilies right of Violinist:** V L G _
13. **Loafers in House 4:** _ _ _ L

**Putting it Together:**

Now we can combine the information:

* **House 4:** Loafers
* **House 3:**  We know Green is left of the Pianist, and Lilies are right of the Violinist. This means House 3 must be the Violinist.
* **House 2:**  We know Blue is left of Pizza, and Running Shoes are left of Daffodils and Pizza. This means House 2 must be the Blue person.
* **House 1:** The only remaining spot for White.

**Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 1. The answer is (C).**

"Let's break this down like we're tracking prey - carefully and methodically.  We need to use the clues to figure out where everyone lives and what they're doing.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Start with the most concrete clues:**

   * Clue 9: Oranges are in house #2.
   * Clue 12: The swimmer is in house #2.
   * Clue 10: The fish enthusiast is in house #3.
   * Clue 13: The pizza eater is in house #5.

2. **Build from there:**

   * Clue 8: Oranges are to the right of mangos, and we know oranges are in house #2, so mangos must be in house #1.
   * Clue 2: The cat lover is to the left of the fish enthusiast, so the cat lover is in house #2.
   * Clue 1: Grilled cheese and pizza are next to each other, and pizza is in house #5, so grilled cheese must be in house #4.
   * Clue 3: Fried rice isn't in house #1, and we've filled houses 1-4, so fried rice must be in house #5.

3. **Keep connecting the dots:**

   * Clue 4: Basketball is to the right of tennis.
   * Clue 5: Cricket is to the left of tennis.
   * Clue 7: Cricket is to the right of the swimmer.

   This means the order must be: Swimmer - Cricket - Tennis - Basketball. Since we know the swimmer is in house #2, we can fill in the rest.

4. **Final Touches:**

   * Clue 6: Two houses between spaghetti and the bird keeper.
   * Clue 11: The bird keeper is to the right of the apple eater.
   * Clue 14: One house between the dog owner and the kiwi eater.

   With the remaining spaces, we can deduce the rest of the placements.

**Now, to answer your question:**

By carefully piecing together all the clues, you'll find that the person eating grapes lives in **house #1**. 

**So the answer is (E).** 


Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the complete solution! 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses (1-4) as columns and the characteristics (car, lunch, flowers, fruit, color) as rows.

**2. Fill in the Obvious:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

**3. Use Connecting Clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 9:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

These clues tell us that the order must be: Mangos - Pizza - Blue - Red (or some variation with these elements in this order).

* **Clue 11:** The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 13:** The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.

This means the Pizza person must be next to both the Rose Bouquet and the Apples.

* **Clue 7:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.

**4. Deduce and Complete:**

By carefully combining these clues and considering the limitations of house numbers and unique characteristics, you can deduce the placement of each person and their attributes. 

**5. Find the Pizza House:**

Once you've filled in the grid, you'll be able to determine the house number where the person who had pizza lives.

"The person eating mangos lives in **house number 1**. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Clue 2** tells us the baseball player lives in house number 2.
* **Clue 3** tells us the convertible driver lives in house number 2.
* **Clue 1** tells us the grape eater doesn't live in house number 1.

Since the baseball player and convertible driver are in house number 2, and the grape eater isn't in house number 1, the mango eater must be in house number 1. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the kiwi eater must be in house number 3.

* **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.  This means the apple eater is in house 1 and the orange eater is in house 2.

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the blue lover is in house 2, and the kiwi eater is in house 3, the green lover must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the white lover.


**Therefore, the answer is (A) 3.** 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means they are in houses 1 and 2 in that order.
* **Clue 3:** The person with the gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.  Since the mystery book reader is in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 1.
* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet must be in house 1.


**Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.** 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Visualize:**

Imagine the houses numbered 1 through 4.

**2. Use the Clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The truck is directly left of the sedan.  Let's represent this as ""Truck - Sedan"".
* **Clue 2:** The truck is two houses away from the dog owner. This means the dog owner can't be in house 1 or 4.
* **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast is directly left of the dog owner.

**3. Combine Clues:**

* Since the dog owner can't be in houses 1 or 4, and the fish enthusiast is to their left, the only possible arrangement for these three is ""Fish - Dog -  _  _"".

* Now, we know the truck is two houses away from the dog owner, so the truck must be in house 1: ""Truck -  _  Fish - Dog"".

*  We also know the sedan is directly right of the truck: ""Truck - Sedan - Fish - Dog"".

**4. Final Placement:**

* This leaves house 4 for the minivan and the cat lover: ""Truck - Sedan - Fish - Dog - Minivan - Cat Lover"".

**Answer:** The dog owner lives in **house 3 (C)**.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the bird keeper lives:

While I'm a hunter, and this is more of a logic puzzle, I can still use my skills of observation and deduction to solve it.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**

   * Clue 6 tells us the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

2. **Build from there:**

   * Clue 7 says the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the grape eater.
   * Clue 3 says the grape eater lives to the right of the basketball player.

3. **Combine clues:**

   * This means the order must be Basketball player - Grape eater - Loafer wearer.

4. **Keep going:**

   * Clue 1 says the cricketer is to the right of the orange eater.
   * Clue 2 says the baseball player is to the left of the cat lover.
   * Clue 4 says the dog owner is to the left of the green lover.
   * Clue 5 says the sandal wearer is to the right of the dog owner.

5. **Deduce the full order:**

   *  We can now piece together the full order from left to right:

      * **House 1:** Dog owner,  Wearing Sandals
      * **House 2:** Likes Blue
      * **House 3:**  Cricketer, Loafer wearer, Likes Green

6. **Final step:**

   * We don't have a direct clue about the bird keeper's location. However, we know the cat lover is somewhere to the right of the baseball player. Since the baseball player can only be in house 1, the cat lover must be in house 2 or 3.  This leaves house 1 as the only option for the bird keeper.



**Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 1 (A).** 

"

| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  | Dog | Cricketer |
| 5 |  |  | Coffee |  |  |

**3.  Continue with clues that link positions:**

* **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.
* **Clue 14:** The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

This means the pianist must be two houses left of the bird keeper.

* **Clue 1:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
* **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.

**4.  Incorporate clues about food and drink:**

* **Clue 2:** The phone is directly left of the television.
* **Clue 7:** The rose bouquet is directly left of the carnations.

**3. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 1:** Lilies are to the right of the phone.  Since the phone can't be in the last house (because the TV is to its right), the phone must be in house 1, the TV in house 2, and the lilies must be in house 3 or higher.
* **Clue 4 & 5:** Daffodils are to the right of the radio and not in house 4. This means the radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the daffodils must be in house 5.

**4. Fill in the gaps:**

* We know tulips are in house 3, computer in house 2, and daffodils in house 5.
* Since the rose is left of the carnations, and we have houses 1 and 4 remaining, the rose must be in house 1 and the carnations in house 4.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

**2. Use positional clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

**3. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. This means they can't be next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

**4. Deduce:**

Since the violinist can't be in the fourth house and the pizza eater is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in house 1, 2, or 3.  The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the guitarist could be in house 1 or 2.

Now, consider the percussionist and science fiction fan. The percussionist is to the right of the science fiction fan. This means they can't be in houses 1 and 2.

**5. Solution:**

The only remaining option for the percussionist is **house 3**. 


**Therefore, the answer is (B).**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.

Since the person who likes white is in the first house, and they live next to the person with daffodils, the person with daffodils must be in the second house. This also means the person who owns horses is in either the second or third house (due to Clue 7).

**3. Use more clues to narrow it down:**

* **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.

This means the person with horses can't be in the second house (because the dog owner would have to be in the third, and we don't know about the boots yet).  Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in the **third house**.


**Answer: (C) 3**

* **Clue 2:** The golfer doesn't live in house #2.

**4. Deduce:**

Let's try placing the tennis player in house #1. This means the television must be in house #2 (due to clue 1).  The radio would then be in house #3 (due to clue 5).

Now, since the computer and tulips are next to each other, they must be in houses #2 and #3 (in some order).

**5. Final Solution:**

**3.  Combine clues and deduce:**

Since the daffodils are in the fifth house and the running shoes are to their left, the running shoes must be in the fourth house.  The cricketer is also in the fourth house, so we know the cricketer is wearing running shoes.

The sandals are to the left of the tulips, and the cellist is two houses to the right of the sandals. This means the sandals can't be in the first house.

The basketball player and baseball player are next to each other, and we know the cricketer is in the fourth house. This means the basketball player and baseball player must be in the first and second houses.

The violinist is in the second house, so the basketball player must be in the first house.

**4. Final Deduction:**

Knowing the basketball player is in the first house, and the sandals are to the left of the tulips, the sandals must be in the **first house**.

* House 2: Daffodils
* House 3: Roses
* House 4: Carnations

* **Clue 1:** The mystery reader and swimmer are separated by one house.
* **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast is directly left of the swimmer.
* **Clue 9:** There are two houses between the mystery reader and the romance lover.

Considering these clues, the only possible arrangement is:

* House 1: Mystery Reader, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
* House 2: Daffodils
* House 3: Roses
* House 4: Carnations, Swimmer

* **Clue 2:** The tennis player lives to the right of the mystery reader.
* **Clue 5:** The golfer is to the right of the daffodils.
* **Clue 7:** The tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house.

This means the tennis player must be in house 3, and the golfer in house 4.

* House 1: Mystery Reader, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
* House 2: Daffodils,  
* House 3: Roses, Tennis Player
* House 4: Carnations, Swimmer, Golfer

Since the romance lover is two houses away from the mystery reader, they must live in **House 3**.



**Therefore, the answer is (D) 3.**

* **Focus on the direct clues:**

    * Clue 7 tells us Fried Rice is in house #3. That's our starting point.
    * Clue 6 says Red is directly left of Stew.

* **Build from there:**

    * Since we know Fried Rice is in house #3, and Red is to the left of Stew, Stew can't be in house #2 (Clue 2) or #4 (Clue 3).  This means Stew must be in house #5.
    * Red then must be in house #4.

* **Use the spacing clues:**

    * Clue 8 says there's one house between White and Yellow.

* **Connect the dots:**

    * We know Red is in #4 and Stew is in #5. This means White can't be in #2 or #3.  
    * Since there's one house between White and Yellow, White must be in house #1.

**Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.**

"The bird keeper lives in house **(B) 2**. Here's why:

* **Clue 1:** Tells us the violinist lives in house 1.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses (1-5) as columns and the characteristics (flowers, shoes, device, lunch, book) as rows.

**2. Fill in the Obvious:**

* **House 1:** Rose bouquet, Gameboy (from clues 4 and 20)
* **House 2:** Boots (from clue 1)
* **House 4:** Pizza (from clue 10)

**3. Use the Clues:**

Now, carefully work through the remaining clues, filling in the grid as you go.  Pay close attention to clues that give you relative positions (left of, right of, directly next to).

* **Clue 2:** Boots are left of Grilled Cheese.
* **Clue 5:** Pizza is left of Spaghetti.
* **Clue 6:** Lilies are right of History Book Buff.
* **Clue 7:** Sandals are right of High Heels.
* **Clue 8:** Rose Bouquet is left of History Book Buff.
* **Clue 9:** Science Fiction Fanatic is not in House 5.
* **Clue 11:** Romance Book Lover is left of Daffodils.
* **Clue 12:** Television is in House 3.
* **Clue 13:** Loafers are left of Mystery Book Reader.
* **Clue 14:** Carnations are left of Science Fiction Fanatic.
* **Clue 15:** Stew is not in House 2.
* **Clue 16:** Running Shoes and Computer are next to each other.
* **Clue 17:** Phone is not in House 4.
* **Clue 18:** Computer is right of Daffodils.
* **Clue 19:** Daffodils are right of Tulips.

**4. Deduce and Complete:**

By carefully piecing together the clues, you'll be able to deduce the location of each item and person. 

**5. Find the Computer:**

Once your grid is complete, you'll be able to see which house number corresponds to the person with the computer. 



Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the entire deduction process. It can be a bit lengthy!

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the dog owner is in the second house (since the high heels wearer is to their left).
* **Clue 4:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots. This means the SUV owner is in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

Now let's put it all together:

* **House 1:** Cat lover, SUV
* **House 2:** Dog owner, Boots
* **House 3:** Sedan 

Since the boots wearer is in house 2, and we've accounted for the cat lover, SUV owner, dog owner, and sedan owner, the person wearing running shoes **must** live in house 3.

**Answer:** (C) 3

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. This means the person wearing boots is in house 2, and the person who likes green is in house 3.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.  Since we know house 3 is taken, the kiwi eater must be in house 2, and the blue lover in house 3.
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.  

**3. Deduce the remaining information:**

* We know house 3 is occupied by the tea drinker and the person who likes blue.
* Since the kiwi eater is in house 2, the person who likes milk and eats apples must be in house 1.
* This leaves the oranges for the person in house 2.

**Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 1. The answer is (C).** 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 2** tells us the mystery book reader lives in house #1.
* **Clue 1** says the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history buff, so the history buff must be in house #2.
* **Clue 4** states the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person with the television, meaning the person with the television is in house #2.
* **Clue 3** tells us the computer owner is to the right of the phone owner.  

Since the mystery reader (house #1) is left of the history buff/television owner (house #2), the phone must be in house #1 and the computer in house #3.

* This leaves house #3 for the science fiction book fanatic.


**Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.**
