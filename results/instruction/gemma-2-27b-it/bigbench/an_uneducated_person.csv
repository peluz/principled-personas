"Well, the flutist lives in house number 2, and the tulips are right next to the guitarist. So the tulips gotta be in house number 1. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Okay, so the green lover is in the first house and eats kiwis.  That's two things figured out!

The root beer drinker is somewhere to the right of the person with the TV and the water drinker.

The cellist is either next to the gameboy person or one house away.

Gosh, this is tricky!  I'm not sure I can figure this out.  Maybe someone who's better at puzzles can help? 



"
"Hmm, lots of words there!  

Let's see...

The paper says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

It says the daffodils are next to the swimmer, and the swimmer's gotta be next to the oranges.  So, they can't be in house number 1.

And the tulips are to the right of the mangos, so they can't be in house number 1 neither.

That means the daffodils gotta be in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The violinist lives in the first house, so that's house number 1.

And the history buff lives to the right of the tulips.

Hmm... that means the tulips can't be in house number 3, 'cause then the history buff would be in house number 4, and there ain't no house number 4!

So the tulips gotta be in house number 2. 


So the answer is (B) 2.
"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Lotsa words there!  

Okay, so the bird person ain't in the first house, and neither is the fish person.  And the mystery reader is in the middle house.

The history buff is next to the lilies, and the gameboy person is next to the roses.

So the sandals guy must be in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Okay, so the golfer's in the first house.  And the swimmer's gotta be next to the romance reader, but not in the third house.

That means the swimmer must be in house number two, and the romance reader in house number three!

The mystery reader is right next to the history buff...

Shoot, I dunno about the basketball player.  This is harder than it looks! 



"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number **3**. 

That's what the clues tell us! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the green person is next to the gameboy person, and the gameboy person is next to the computer person.  That means they gotta be all in a row.

And the yellow person ain't in the middle house.

Gosh, that means the computer person must be in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Let's see... the cat lover is in the first house.  And the tulips are next to the dog.  

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is too much thinkin' for me! 



"
"Well, the fella with the phone lives in the first house, that's for sure. And the boots guy don't live in the second house.  So, the high heels must be in the second house, right?

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Hmm, this is tricky!  Lots of folks and things to keep track of.  

Let me see...  

*They say the computer and grilled cheese folks are neighbors, and grilled cheese ain't in the last house. So maybe they're in houses 1 and 2?*

*And the phone is one house away from the blue lover...*

*Hold on, I gotta think...* 

*This is harder than figuring out which way the wind's blowin'!* 


Let me know if you want to give me another clue!
"

Hmm, so the SUV must be in house 4 or 5.

* The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

* The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

So, the sedan and yellow must be next to the water drinker.

I'm gonna guess the sedan is in house **(E) 2**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The kiwi fella's in the first house, that's for sure. And the truck ain't in the first or third house, so it must be in the second.  

That means the SUV can't be in the first or second house, so it gotta be in the third house.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"

* The lilies are to the right of the science fiction fan.

That means the green lover must be in house number 1!

"
"Well, the red house is number 2, and the mystery reader lives to the right of it. So the mystery reader must be in house number 3.  That means the fantasy reader can't be in house 3, and they can't be in house 1, so they gotta be in house number 1.

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"

The fifth clue tells us that.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Okay, so the fried rice eater ain't in the first house. And the SUV ain't in the second house.

The flutist lives next to the white-liker, and the loafer-wearer also lives next to the white-liker.

That means the white-liker must be in the second house, right?  'Cause if they were in the first, there wouldn't be room for both the flutist and the loafer-wearer next to 'em.

So, if the white-liker's in the second house, the sandals gotta be in the first house.

**So the answer is (A) 1**

"
"Well, lemme see...

It says the root beer lover don't live in the middle house, so it's gotta be either the first or the last one.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, this is tricky!

Now, we know the first house has spaghetti and boots, the second has green and high heels, and the third has stew.

That leaves fried rice for the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**.

Let me see...  

* The minivan and fried rice are next to each other.

* The minivan is right before the truck.

*  Hmm, I'm gonna need to draw this out...

(The person would then proceed to draw a simple diagram to help them visualize the clues) 


Let me know if you want me to keep going! This is tricky!
"
"Well, lemme see...

The spaghetti eater is in the first house, that's easy. And the golfer's in the last house.

The pizza guy lives right next to the basketball player, and the percussionist is right next to the pizza guy.

Hmm, that's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me think...



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

The basketball player is in the middle house, and the violinist is also in the middle house.  That means the soccer player must be in the first or last house.

But the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't be in the last house.

So the soccer player must be in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and stuff.  

Let me see... the mystery reader is in the last house, and the water drinker is too.  

*scratches head*

I dunno, maybe house number 3? 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The coffee drinker's in house number 4, and the flutist is there too.  And the horse person is in house number 4 as well.

That means the fish person can't be in house 4.

Hmmm...  

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is harder than it looks!  Maybe someone else can figure it out. 



"
"Well, the pianist lives in house number 2, and they live right next to the person with the daffodils. So the daffodils must be in house number 1. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, shoot, this is a right brain twister!  

Let me see... the fella eatin' oranges is in the first house, and the banana eater's in the fourth.  And that SUV's in the fourth house too.

Hmm...  

*scratches head*

I'm gonna need a pencil and paper to draw this out. I'm not so good with all these numbers and stuff in my head. 



"
"Well, the soccer player lives in house number 2, and the root beer lover lives to the right of the grilled cheese eater.  So the root beer lover must live in house number **2**. 



"
"Gosh, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and numbers.  

Let me see... the daffodils are in the second house, and the yellow-liker is right next to them.  

Hmmm... I think the swimmer is in house number **(C) 3**.  

But I could be wrong!  I'm not so good with all these puzzles.
"
"Well, the violinist lives in the first house, so that's house number 1.  

And the computer person lives to the left of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper can't be in house number 1.

That means the bird keeper must be in house number 2.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Gosh, that's a lot of information!  

Let me see... the person with the computer lives next to the one with the running shoes.  And the person with the running shoes is next to the one with the carnations.

Hmm... I think the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The fella in the second house wears boots, and the sedan's in the third house.  That means the SUV must be in the first house, right?

And the cat lover's in the first house too.

So, the high heel wearer's gotta be in the first house 'cause they're next to the dog owner.

That leaves the running shoes for the third house, don't it?

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The person with the carnations is in the first house, and the tulips are in the second.  That means the lilies gotta be in the third house.

The tea drinker is in the third house too, so they must be the one with the lilies.

The kiwi eater is right next to the blue lover, and the apples and milk drinker are next to each other.

Hmm... that's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me think...

*House 1: Carnations, running shoes*

*House 2: Tulips*

*House 3: Lilies, tea*

Okay, so the apples and milk folks gotta be in house 1 and 2.

That means the apples are in house 1!


So the answer is (C) 1.
"
"Well, lemme see...

The mystery fella lives in the first house, that's for sure. And he's right next to the history buff. So the history buff must be in house number two.

The mystery guy also has the TV, 'cause he's next to it.

That means the computer person is in house number three, 'cause they gotta be to the right of the phone person.

So, the science fiction fan must be the one with the phone, and they're in house number... **(C) 2**.

"Well, let's see...

Eve starts with Melissa. Then she dances with Claire, then with Bob, then Claire again, and finally with Alice.

That means Eve ends up dancin' with **(B) Ophelia**.

Then Bob and Dave swap, but that don't matter to Dave's final ball.

Eve swaps with Alice who has black, so Eve has black now.

Claire swaps with Bob, but again, that don't matter for Dave.

Finally, Alice and Eve swap. Alice gets blue, and Eve gets black.

So Dave still has his green ball! 

The answer is (B). 



"
"Eve started as cheerleader and kept switchin' positions with other folks.  So at the end, Eve's gotta be playin' somethin' else.  

I'd say Eve is playin' **(A) right winger**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Eve started with Jamie, then danced with Bob, then Dave, then Claire.  

Dave started with Patrick, then danced with Eve.

So Dave is dancin' with **Eve** at the end.

She keeps the white present after that.

So the answer is (A).

Alice starts with Jamie, then dances with Claire, so that's not it.

Then Claire dances with Dave, then Bob, then Dave again...

So at the end, Alice must be dancin' with **(D) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts with Jamie, then dances with Dave, then Bob, then back to Dave. So Dave ends up with Alice.

That means Helga must be dancin' with... hmm...

Then Dave and Bob swapped, but that don't matter much to Dave gettin' the black ball at the end. Then Dave and Claire swapped, so Dave got the orange ball and Claire got the pink ball. They swapped again, so Claire got the brown present back and Dave got the orange ball again. Last, Eve and Alice swapped, so Eve got the brown present and Alice got the black ball.

So the answer is (C), Dave has the black ball at the end.

Bob started as a benchwarmer. Then he swapped with Alice, so he was a left midfielder. Then he swapped with Dave, so he was a cheerleader. Then he swapped with Dave again, so he was back to a cheerleader.

So the answer is **(B) cheerleader**. 



"
"Gertrude starts as left midfielder.  She swaps with Alice, then with Eve.  That means Gertrude ends up playing...  right midfielder.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Eve started as a benchwarmer.  She swapped with Dave, then Alice, so she must be playin' somethin' on the field now. 

I think the answer is **(A) left winger**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts as right midfielder, then swaps with Claire, then with Gertrude, then with Bob, then with Gertrude again.  That's a lot of swappin'!

So, at the end, Alice is playin' **(A) striker**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Lotsa names and book swappin'!  

Fred started with The Great Gatsby, right?  And he swapped with Bob at the end.  

So Fred musta ended up with whatever Bob had before they swapped.

Bob swapped with Dave a couple times, so gotta keep track of that...

*shrugs*

I dunno, too many swaps for me to keep straight! 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Eve starts with Izzi, then switches with Gertrude. Then nothin' happens with Eve for a while. Then she switches with Bob. So Eve ends up dancin' with... Bob's partner.

Bob starts with Melissa, then dances with Fred, then Eve, then Claire, then Alice, then Claire again, and finally Dave.

So Eve ends up with **(A) Melissa**. 



"
"Eve starts with the yellow ball.  She swaps with Alice, so she gets the purple ball.  Then she don't swap no more. So the answer is (D). 



"
"Eve starts with the yellow present. She swaps with Bob, so she gets the orange ball. Then she swaps with Bob again and gets the purple present. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, lots of switchin' around!  Let's see...

Alice starts as left midfielder, then trades with Dave, then Gertrude, then Eve...  

I think she ends up as... **(A) left winger**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice danced with Bob, then Claire, then back to Bob.  Eve danced with Gertrude, then Dave.  Dave started with Melissa...

Hmm, that's a lot of switchin'!  I dunno, maybe it's (G) Melissa? 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts with the red present. She swaps with Claire, so she gets the pink ball. Then she swaps with Dave, so she gets the purple present. Then she swaps with Fred, so she gets the black ball.  

So the answer is (G) black ball. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Claire starts as center midfielder. Then she swaps with Fred, so she's left midfielder. Then she swaps with Eve, so she's left winger.

So the answer is **(B) left winger**. 



"
"Eve starts with Moby Dick.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

They traded a bunch of books, huh?  

Alice started with The Odyssey, then swapped with Dave, then Bob, then Eve.  

So Alice ends up with... **(C) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Eve starts with the white ball. She swaps with Alice, then Bob.  

I think Eve ends up with the **(C) red ball**.

*counts on fingers*

...he ends up with **(C) Lola**.

So the answer is (F) brown present. 



"
"Hmm, lots of switchin' around!  Let's see...

Eve was the goalie, then she swapped with Fred, then Alice, then Dave.  So Eve must be playin' fullback now.

Alice was the left midfielder, then she swapped with Gertrude, then Eve. So Alice must be the goalie now.


So the answer is (C) goalkeeper. 

"
"Fred starts with Lolita.

* He swaps with Alice, so he has Moby Dick.
* He swaps with Eve, so he has Ulysses.
* He swaps with Bob, so he has Hound of the Baskervilles.

So the answer is (G). 



"
"Well, lemme see... Gertrude got the purple present from Bob first, then the orange ball from Dave, then the yellow present from Eve.  So Dave musta ended up with the...  pink ball! 


So the answer is (C).
"
"Let's see... Gertrude got a bunch of different presents.  She started with green, then got orange, then purple, then black, then green again.  Eve got black from Gertrude, then traded it to Dave, then got it back from Alice.

So Eve has the **(A) black ball**. 



"
"Claire starts with Moby Dick.

* Eve and Bob swap, that don't involve Claire.
* Eve and Claire swap, so Claire now has Lolita.
* Gertrude and Alice swap, that don't involve Claire.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Claire now has The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Alice and Bob swap, that don't involve Claire.
* Bob and Dave swap, that don't involve Claire.

So the answer is (G) Frankenstein. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

They switch partners a whole bunch, huh?  

Let's see... Bob starts with Helga, then dances with Dave, then... oh boy, this is a lot to keep track of!

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is too much partner-swappin' for me!  I'd get all mixed up. 



"
"Eve starts with the black ball.  She swaps with Fred, so she gets the green present.  She keeps that the rest of the time.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Bob starts with the black ball. He swaps with Eve, then Alice.  

So Bob ends up with... the white ball! 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Eve starts with white, then gets pink, then purple, then green, then...  

Fred starts with red, then gets brown, then pink, then red again, then...

I think Fred ends up with the **(G) red ball**. 



"
"Fred had the pink ball and swapped with Alice, then Claire, then Dave, then Eve.  So Gertrude must have the pink ball now.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Bob started with the yellow ball.  He swapped with Eve, so he musta got her ball... what was it?  White!  So Bob ends up with the white ball.

The answer is (G). 



"
"Eve starts with Frankenstein.

She swaps with Alice, so she gets The Fellowship of the Ring.

She swaps with Alice again, so she gets back Frankenstein.

She swaps with Claire, so she gets The Pearl.

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts with Melissa, then switches with Dave, then with Bob, then with Dave again.  That's a lot of switchin'!

So at the end, Alice is dancin' with **(D) Sam**. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Fred starts with green, then gets pink from Bob, then orange from Claire, then keeps the orange when he swaps with Claire again.

So the answer is (D) orange ball. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Alice starts with the black ball and only swaps with Fred at the very end. So Alice ends up with whatever Fred had before that last swap.

Fred swaps with Bob twice, then Gertrude, then back to Bob, then Gertrude again.  That's a lot of switchin'!

I think Fred ends up with the orange ball 'cause Gertrude had it right before they swapped.

So Alice ends up with the **(G) orange ball**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Dave starts with Melissa. Then he dances with Claire, then someone else...  lots of switchin' around!  But in the end, Dave ends up with... hmm...  I dunno, it's all mixed up!  

Could be any of 'em! 



"
"Let's see... Gertrude had The Fellowship of the Ring and traded with Dave. Then she traded with Bob. So Bob must have The Fellowship of the Ring now.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Fred and Gertrude swapped first, then Fred swapped again with Eve.  Then Bob and Claire swapped, then Claire and Gertrude swapped again.  Dave and Eve swapped, then Alice and Fred swapped, and finally Alice and Bob swapped.

Hmm... I think Claire ends up with the **(F) red present**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Alice starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, then swaps with Eve, so she has Moby Dick. Then she swaps with Bob, so she has Lolita. Then she swaps with Fred, so she has Catch-22.

So the answer is (A) Catch-22. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

They traded a bunch of books, huh?  

Let's see... Gertrude had The Fellowship of the Ring and traded with Dave... then with Bob...

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!  I'm not so good with all these names and books.

Maybe if you wrote down who had what book after each trade, it would be easier to figure out. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

* Fred and Gertrude swap first, so Fred gets the white ball.
* Then Fred gets the black ball from Alice.
* Alice gets the red ball from Claire.
* Bob gets the purple ball from Dave.
* Fred gets the pink ball from Eve.
* Gertrude gets the pink ball from Fred.
* Finally, Bob gets the white ball from Gertrude.

So the answer is (G) white ball. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Gertrude starts with the blue present.  She swaps with Dave, then Dave swaps a bunch of times with other folks.  But Gertrude only swaps with Dave once. So, at the end, Gertrude still has the 
(F) blue present. 



"
"Fred swaps balls a lot!  Let's see...

* First, Fred has yellow.
* Then he swaps with Bob, so he has orange.
* Then he swaps with Claire, so he has white.
* Then he swaps with Eve, so he has blue.
* Then he swaps with Claire again, so he has white again.
* Finally, he doesn't swap.

So Fred ends up with the **(F) white ball**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Bob starts with the orange ball and swaps with Eve. Then Dave swaps with Eve, then with Fred.  So now Fred has somethin' from Dave. Then Alice swaps with Fred, so now Fred has somethin' from Alice.

Claire swaps with Bob, then with Eve, then with Gertrude. So Fred's got somethin' from Alice, not Claire.

Hmm... I dunno, it's all mixed up now.  Maybe Fred ended up with the yellow present? 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Bob starts with the black ball and swaps with Alice who has the white present. So Bob gets the white present and Alice gets the black ball.

Then Dave and Fred swap, but I don't know what they got.

Alice swaps with Gertrude, so now Alice has the purple present and Gertrude has the black ball.

Alice swaps with Eve, so now Alice has the orange ball and Eve has the purple present.

Bob swaps with Claire, so now Bob has the brown present and Claire has the white present.

Dave swaps with Bob, so now Dave has the white present and Bob has the brown present.

Finally, Fred swaps with Eve, but I don't know what they got.

So, at the end, Dave has the **(A) blue present**. 



"
"Claire started with the black ball.  She swapped with Fred, so she got his brown ball.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Hmm, lots of switchin' around!  Let's see...

Alice starts on the bench, then swaps with Bob, then Gertrude...  

I think she ends up as the **(A) striker**. 



"
"Claire starts with Lolita.

* She swaps with Gertrude, so she has Catch-22.
* She swaps with Bob, so she has Frankenstein.
* She swaps with Alice, so she has The Great Gatsby.
* She swaps with Alice again, so she has The Great Gatsby.

So the answer is **(B) The Great Gatsby**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

They swapped a bunch of times, huh?  

Let's see... Bob started as right midfielder, then switched with Gertrude, so he was right winger. Then he switched with Dave, so he was fullback. Then he switched with Dave again, so he was fullback again.

So the answer is (D) fullback. 



"
"Well, Bob started as the striker, and he swapped with Eve, then Alice, then back with Eve.  That's a lot of movin' around!  

Since he started as striker, and swapped with folks, he's gotta be somethin' else now.  

I'd say he's probably the (D) benchwarmer.  All that switchin' around, he's gotta be tired! 



"
"Well, lemme see...

They switch partners a whole bunch, huh?  

Let's see... Fred and Eve switch, then Bob and Dave, then Eve and Alice...  

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!  

*scratches head*

I dunno, maybe it's (A) Sam?  Sounds like a good guess. 



"
"Dave starts with The Pearl.

He swaps with Gertrude, so he gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

He swaps with Gertrude again, so he gets back The Pearl.

He swaps with Bob, so he gets The Fellowship of the Ring.

So the answer is (G). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice danced with Fred, then Claire, then Bob.  Dave danced with Karl, then Fred.

So Dave must be dancin' with **(D) Helga**. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Bob starts with the orange ball. He swaps with Gertrude, so he gets her pink ball. Then he keeps that pink ball the rest of the time.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Eve starts with Melissa. Then she dances with Alice, then Bob, then Claire, then Bob again.  

That's a lot of switchin'!

I think she ends up with... **(G) Helga**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Gertrude started with the brown present, and she swapped with Dave, then Alice, then Eve.  So Fred musta got the brown present from Gertrude.

So the answer is (G). 



"
"Well, lemme see... Fred starts with Sam. Then he dances with Alice, then Gertrude, then Gertrude again, then Dave...  

Gosh, that's a lot of switchin'!  

I reckon Fred ends up with **(D) Ophelia**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Eve starts with Rodrigo. Then she switches with Gertrude.  Then nothin' changes for Eve 'til the very end when she switches with Claire. So Eve ends up with whoever Claire had at the start... which was Helga.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Well, lemme see... Bob starts with Rodrigo. Then he dances with Gertrude, then Fred, then Claire.  That's a lot of switchin'!  

So at the end, Bob's dancin' with Claire.

The answer is (G). 



"
"Gertrude starts with the black ball. She swaps with Fred, then Eve, then Dave.  So at the end, Gertrude has the **(A) blue present**. 



"
"Fred starts as left winger. Then he swaps with Eve, so he's right midfielder. He don't swap no more after that. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

Here's what happens:

* Alice and Claire swap: Dave still has The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Bob and Dave swap: Dave now has The Great Gatsby.
* Dave and Fred swap: Dave now has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Eve and Fred swap: Dave still has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Alice and Dave swap: Dave now has Catch-22.

* She swaps with Alice, so she gets Ulysses.
* She swaps with Bob, so she gets The Odyssey.
* She swaps with Eve, so she gets Frankenstein.
* She swaps with Dave, so she gets Moby Dick.

So the answer is (E) Moby Dick. 



"
"Hmm, lots of switchin' around!  Let's see... Alice started with Sam, then switched with Gertrude, then with Bob...  

I think Alice ends up with **(B) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on! Let's see...

Claire starts with the orange ball. She swaps with Eve, then Gertrude, then back to Eve, so she don't end up with Eve's blue ball.  

Alice starts with the green ball and swaps with Gertrude, then Bob, then Eve, then Dave.  That's a lot of swaps!

I think Claire ends up with the **(F) orange ball**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Fred starts with The Great Gatsby. Then he swaps with Bob, so he gets Hound of the Baskervilles. Then he swaps with Gertrude, so he gets... hmm...  I dunno, what did Gertrude have then?

*scratches head*

This is harder than I thought!  



"
"Alice starts as cheerleader. Then she swaps with Bob, so she's right midfielder. Then she swaps with Gertrude, so she's goalkeeper.  

So the answer is (F). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... lotsa names and books.  

Alice starts with The Great Gatsby, then swaps with Gertrude, then Eve, then Bob, then Claire.  That's a lot of swappin'!

I think... I think Alice ends up with... **(G) Ulysses**. 



"
"Dave starts with the brown ball. He swaps with Fred, so he gets the white ball. Then he swaps with Claire and gets the yellow ball.  

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Fred starts with the white ball.

* He swaps with Alice, so now Fred has the blue ball.
* Then he swaps with Dave, so Fred has the brown ball.
* Then he swaps with Bob, so Fred has the orange ball.

So the answer is (B) orange ball. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Fred got Lolita at first. Then Alice and Fred swapped at the end. Alice had Ulysses at first, so Fred musta ended up with Ulysses.

So the answer is (F). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Bob starts with the pink ball. He swaps with Fred, then Fred swaps with Claire, and then Claire swaps with Alice.  That's a lot of swappin'!

So Bob ends up with... the **(F) orange ball**. 



"
"Well, Bob started as the cheerleader, then he swapped with Claire, then with Fred, then with Alice, then with Fred again.  That's a lot of swappin'!  

Since he swapped with Fred twice, I think Bob ends up back where he started, cheerin' on the team.

So the answer is (F) cheerleader. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts with Karl, then dances with Bob, then Claire, then back to Bob, then back to Karl.

So the answer is (E) Karl.

Then Claire swaps with Eve, Dave swaps with Gertrude, Eve swaps with Dave again, Dave swaps with Fred again, Fred swaps with Claire, and finally Claire swaps with Bob.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!  

I think Alice ends up with the **pink ball**.

"Well, lemme see...

Alice starts with Lola, then dances with Claire, then Fred, then Alice again.  That's a lot of switchin'!

Dave starts with Izzi, then dances with Claire, then... hmm...

I'm losin' track!  This dancin' is makin' my head spin! 

Can ya tell me who Dave ends up with?



"
"Well, lemme see...

Fred had the brown present and Eve had the white one, then they swapped. So Fred has the white one now.

Gertrude had the red one and Alice had the pink one, then they swapped. So Gertrude has the pink one now.

Alice had the pink one and Bob had the blue one, then they swapped. So Alice has the blue one now.

Alice had the blue one and Dave had the yellow one, then they swapped. So Alice has the yellow one now.

Alice had the yellow one and Fred had the white one, then they swapped. So Alice has the white one now.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Well, lemme see... Bob starts as the right winger. Then he swaps with Fred, so he's the right midfielder. Then he swaps with Dave, so he's the striker. Finally, he swaps with Dave again, so he must be back to bein' the...  right winger!

So the answer is (F). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Fred starts with the blue ball and swaps with Gertrude, then with Eve.  That means Fred ends up with...  

*thinks hard*

...the white ball! So the answer is (D). 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Eve starts with the green ball.  She swaps with Alice, then Alice swaps with a bunch of folks.  But Eve don't swap with nobody else. So Eve still got the green ball at the end.

So the answer is (C). 



"

So the answer is (A).

Bob started with The Great Gatsby and traded with Claire, so Claire got that one. Then Claire traded with Fred, so Fred got The Great Gatsby.

Fred traded with Eve, so Eve got The Great Gatsby.

"
"Claire started as right winger.  Lots of folks moved around, but Claire stayed on the field. So Claire is still playin' right winger.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, lots of switchin' around!  Let's see... Alice started with Karl, then danced with Bob... then... oh boy, all these names are makin' my head spin!

I dunno, maybe (B) Izzi?  They switched a lot, it's hard to keep track!

So, at the end, Bob is dancin' with Claire.  

But that ain't one of the choices.  Hmm... maybe I messed up countin'. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Fred starts with Karl, then switches with Gertrude.  Then they switch a bunch more times, but Fred don't switch with nobody else after that first time. So Fred ends up with Gertrude's last partner.

Gertrude starts with Lola, then switches with Fred, then Alice, then Eve.  So Fred ends up with **(F) Lola**. 



"
"Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

She swaps with Bob, then Dave, then Bob again.  That's a lot of swappin'!

Since she swaps with Bob twice, she ends up with his book. Bob started with Ulysses.

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Claire started with the yellow present.  She swapped with Dave, then nobody else swapped with her. So she still has the yellow present.

So the answer is (A).

Okay, so Dave ended up as... hmm... I think he ended up as **(C) fullback**. 



"
"Alice starts with the white present. She swaps with Eve, then with Eve again, and then with Bob.  That's a lot of swappin'!  I bet she ends up with somethin' different.

So the answer ain't (A).

"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Claire starts with yellow, then gets green from Bob, then black from Dave, then purple from Gertrude.  

So Bob must have the **purple ball** at the end. 

(C)
"
"Bob started as the goalkeeper.  He only swapped with Fred. So Bob ended up playing left midfielder. 

The answer is (G). 



"
"Gertrude starts with the orange ball.  She swaps with Eve, who has the white present. So Gertrude ends up with the white present.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

Claire danced with a bunch of folks: Fred, Dave, Eve, then back to Dave.  Fred started with Claire, then danced with someone else... hmm...

I think Fred ended up with **(G) Sam**. 



"
"Well, Gertrude started dancin' with Karl. Then she switched with Eve, then with Fred. So at the end, Gertrude must be dancin' with **(F) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Let's see...

Eve and Claire swapped, then Claire swapped with Fred, so Claire had Fred's book for a bit. Then Bob and Gertrude swapped, and Alice swapped with Fred.  Claire swapped with Dave, then Bob and Gertrude swapped again. Finally, Eve and Bob swapped.

I think Bob ended up with the **(B) blue present**. 



"
"Gertrude starts with The Pearl.  She swaps with Eve, then Fred, so she must have one of their books.

Alice starts with the white present. She swaps with Dave, so she must have the pink ball now.

So the answer is (G) right winger. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see... Eve starts with the blue ball.  She swaps with Alice at the end. Alice had the yellow ball at the start, so Eve must end up with the yellow ball.

"
"Well, lemme see...

They swapped a whole bunch of times, huh?  

Let's see... Fred was the right midfielder, then he swapped with Alice, then Gertrude, then Bob, then Gertrude again.

Eve started with the red present, then got Fred's pink ball, then Gertrude's black ball.

So at the end, Eve has the **(B) black ball**. 



"
"Dave started with Moby Dick.  He swapped with Eve, then Eve swapped with Alice, and Alice swapped with Dave.  That means Dave ended up with Alice's book, which was The Great Gatsby.

"
"Claire starts with the brown ball.

She swaps with Gertrude, so she gets the green ball.

Then she swaps with Bob, so she gets the red ball.

She swaps with Bob again, so she gets the red ball again.

"
"Claire starts with the orange ball.  

Let's see who she trades with:

* Gertrude and Alice swap, doesn't involve Claire.
* Fred and Bob swap, doesn't involve Claire.
* Fred and Claire swap, so Claire gets Fred's ball which is green.
* Eve and Dave swap, doesn't involve Claire.
* Alice and Eve swap, doesn't involve Claire.

So the answer is (A). 



"

So the answer is (F). 



"
"Gertrude started with Lolita. She swapped with Dave, then Dave swapped with Bob, and Bob swapped with Claire.  Claire swapped with Fred, then Alice, then Dave.  That's a lot of swappin'!

Since Gertrude swapped with Dave first, and Dave swapped with a bunch of folks, Gertrude probably ended up with one of the books Dave had.  

I'd say Gertrude has **(F) Catch-22**. 



"
"Gertrude starts with Moby Dick.

She swaps with Claire, so she has The Great Gatsby.

She swaps with Eve, so she has The Fellowship of the Ring.

So the answer is (E).

"Fred starts with a brown present.

He swaps with Alice, so he gets her blue present.

Then he swaps with Dave, so he gets Dave's black ball.

I dunno what she has now, but it ain't brown no more. 

So the answer ain't (D). 



"
"Dave got The Pearl at the start. He swapped with Bob, then Bob swapped with Gertrude, then Dave swapped with Bob again.  That's a lot of swappin'!  I think Dave ends up with...  

(B) The Pearl. 



"
"Hmm, lots of swappin' goin' on!  Let's see...

Alice starts with the white ball and only swaps with Eve. So Alice ends up with the blue ball.

"
"Well, lemme see... Gertrude was the goalkeeper, then she swapped with Bob, then Dave, then Fred, then Gertrude again.  That's a lot of switchin'!  

Fred was the cheerleader, then he swapped with Dave, then Gertrude, then Claire.

So the answer is (B). 



"
