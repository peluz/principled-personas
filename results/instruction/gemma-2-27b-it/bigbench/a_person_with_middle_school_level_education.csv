"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 4:** The pianist lives one house away from the flutist, so the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The tulips are to the left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist can't be in house 1.

* **Clue 3:** The lilies are to the left of the carnations.

Let's try putting this information together:

1.  **House 1:** Could be the pianist or lilies
2.  **House 2:** Flutist
3.  **House 3:** Could be the guitarist or carnations
4.  **House 4:** Could be the pianist or tulips

Since the guitarist can't be in house 1, the tulips must be in house 3!

* **House #** | **Drink** | **Fruit** | **Lunch** | **Shoes** | **Car**
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |          |          |          |          |

"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges. This means the soccer player can be in house 1 or 2, and the orange eater must be in house 2 or 3.

* **Clue 2:** The swimmer and daffodil person live next to each other.

* **Clue 3:** The tulip person is to the right of the mango eater.

* **Clue 4:** The daffodil person is to the right of the orange eater.

Let's try putting the clues together. Since the daffodil person is to the right of the orange eater, and they live next to the swimmer, the only way this can work is if:

* House 1: Orange eater
* House 2: Swimmer and Daffodils

This fits with all the clues! 


**So the answer is (B) 2** 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **We know the violinist lives in house #1.**

* **Clue 7 tells us the history book buff lives to the right of the tulips.**

* **Clue 6 says the tulips and the phone are next to each other.**

* **Clue 5 says the radio and history book buff have one house between them.**

Let's try putting this together. If the tulips are in house #1 (with the violinist), that means the history buff would be in house #3 and the radio in house #2. But that doesn't leave room for the phone to be next to the tulips.

So, the tulips can't be in house #1.

* **That means the tulips must be in house #2.** This puts the phone in house #3 and the history buff in house #3. 


**So the answer is (B) 2.**

**2. Use the clues to fill in more:**

* **Clue 1:** Tulips are left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 4:** Lilies are right of the horse owner.

**3.  Think about the possibilities:**

Since we don't know where the horse owner is yet, let's try placing them in different houses and see if it works with the clues.

* **If the horse owner is in House 2:**
    * Lilies would have to be in House 3 or 4.
    * Tulips would have to be in House 1 (left of the dog owner).
    * This leaves House 4 for the dog owner and House 3 for the carnations.
    * This works with all the clues!

**4.  Find the fish enthusiast:**

We've placed the cat lover, horse owner, dog owner, and the person with carnations. The only house left is House 4, which means the **fish enthusiast lives in House 4**.

* **Houses:** 1, 2, 3
* **Instruments:** Piano, Violin, Percussion
* **Shoes:** Running shoes, High heels, Boots
* **Fruit:** Oranges, Banana, Kiwis
* **Devices:** Television, Phone, Radio

**Using the clues:**

1. **Pianist not in house 1:**  This means the pianist is in house 2 or 3.
2. **Oranges right of Kiwis:**  This means the kiwis are in house 1 or 2, and the oranges are in house 2 or 3.
3. **High heels and Pianist next to each other:** They could be in houses 1 & 2 or 2 & 3.
4. **Running shoes and Percussion next to each other:** Same as above, they could be in houses 1 & 2 or 2 & 3.
5. **Kiwis left of Boots:** This means the boots are in house 3.
6. **Radio left of High heels:** This helps us place the radio.
7. **Oranges left of Television:** This is a key clue!

**Putting it together:**

* Since the boots are in house 3, and the kiwis are left of the boots, the kiwis must be in house 1 or 2.
* The oranges are right of the kiwis, so the oranges must be in house 2 or 3.
* The oranges are left of the television, so the television must be in house 3.

    * Clue 3 says the truck is directly left of the sandals.
    * Clue 5 says the loafers are left of the truck.

* **Think it through:**

    Since the loafers are left of the truck, and the truck is left of the sandals, the order must be loafers - truck - sandals.

* **Keep going:**

    Clue 1 says there's one house between the loafers and the minivan.  
    Clue 10 says there's one house between the green and the truck.

* **Putting it together:**

    * House 3: ?
    * House 4: White

* **Clue 1:** The person with the television lives directly left of the tea drinker.

**2. Combine the clues:**

Since the TV person is left of the guitarist and also left of the tea drinker, this means the order must be: TV - Guitarist - Tea Drinker.

**3. Use more clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.  We know the second house has roses, so the tea drinker must be in house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The kiwi eater is to the right of the coffee drinker.

* **Clue 5:** There's one house between the flutist and the banana eater.

**4.  Let's fill in what we know:**

* House 1:  ? - ? - ?
* House 2: Roses - ? - ?
* House 3: TV - Guitarist - Tea Drinker

**5. Keep going:**

We know the TV person is in house 2, so the guitarist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 3.

* House 1: Guitarist - ? - ?
* House 2: Roses - TV - ?
* House 3: ? - ? - Tea Drinker

**6.  Final Deductions:**

* We know the kiwi eater is right of the coffee drinker. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the kiwi eater in house 2.

* We know the flutist is one house away from the banana eater. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the banana eater in house 2.

* House 1: Guitarist - Flutist - Coffee Drinker
* House 2: Roses - TV - Banana Eater
* House 3: Kiwi Eater - ? - Tea Drinker

* The only thing left is the root beer lover. Since all other houses are filled, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

* **Clue 4** says the root beer lover is in house #3.
* **Clue 1** says the water drinker and minivan owner are next to each other.

Let's try putting that together:

* House #1:  Can't be water drinker
* House #2: Could be water drinker or minivan owner

* **Clue 5** says the sedan is to the left of the daffodils.
* **Clue 8** says the sedan is to the left of the apple eater.

* House #1: Sedan, apples
* House #2:  
* House #3: Root beer lover

* **Clue 2** says the sedan is to the left of the mango eater. Since the sedan is in house #1, the mango eater must be in house #2.

* House #3: Root beer lover

The only spot left for the violinist is in house #2!

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The lilies aren't in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The TV is in the first house.

Since the first house has the TV, and the lilies aren't in the first house, the person with the lilies must be in the second house.  That means the person with the computer must also be in the second house.

**So the answer is (A) 2** 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The science fiction fan lives to the left of the golfer. This means they can't be in house number 2.

* **Clue 2:** The pizza eater and history buff are next to each other.

* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives to the right of the daffodils.

Let's try putting this information together.  Since the science fiction fan can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1.  That means the golfer is in house 2.

We don't know where the pizza eater and history buff are yet, but they have to be together.

The guitarist is to the right of the daffodils, so the daffodils can't be in house 2. That means the daffodils must be in house 1, and the guitarist in house 2.

Now we know:

* House 1: Science fiction fan, daffodils
* House 2: Golfer, guitarist

Since the percussionist is the only one left, they must live in **house 1**.

**2. Use clues that link things together:**

* **Clue 7:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
* **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.

This means the order must be:  ...Television - Gameboy - Guitarist...

* **Clue 4:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.

So now we have: ...Flutist - Television - Gameboy - Guitarist...

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.

This means the radio must be to the right of the guitarist: ...Flutist - Television - Gameboy - Guitarist - Radio...

* **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.

This means the phone must be in house 1, and the fish enthusiast and horse owner are in houses 3 and 4.

**3. Fill in the gaps:**

We know the violinist is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5.  The only spot left for the percussionist is house 2.

**Therefore, the percussionist lives in house number 2. The answer is (B).**

* **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

* **Clue 4:** The person who drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

Let's put the clues together:

Since the person with running shoes is in house #2, and the person who likes white is to the left of the spaghetti eater, the person who likes white must be in house #1 and ate spaghetti.

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The cellist lives to the left of the person with the gameboy. This means the cellist is in house 1 and the gameboy owner is in house 2.

* **Clue 2:** The dog owner doesn't live in house 1. Since the cellist is in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The gameboy is in house number 3.
* **Clue 2:** The minivan is in house number 1.
* **Clue 5:** The convertible is NOT in house number 3.
* **Clue 6:** The computer is NOT in house number 1.

* **Clue 3:** The phone is to the left of the SUV. This means the SUV can't be in house number 1.

* **Clue 4:** The radio is to the right of the gameboy, so the radio is in house number 4.

Let's put it all together:

1. Minivan
2. ?
3. Gameboy
4. Radio

Since the phone is left of the SUV, the SUV must be in house number **2**. 

**So the answer is (D).** 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Step 1: Draw it out!**  It's easier to keep track of the clues if you draw five boxes to represent the houses.

* **Step 2: Use the easy clues first:**

    * Clue 3: The tulips are in house number 3.
    * Clue 6: The computer is in house number 2.

* **Step 3:  Connect the clues:**

    * Clue 2: The phone is to the left of the TV.
    * Clue 1: The lilies are to the right of the phone.

* **Step 4: Keep going!**

    * Clue 7: The roses are to the left of the carnations.
    * Clue 4: The daffodils are to the right of the radio.
    * Clue 5: The daffodils are not in house number 4.

* **Step 5:  Think it through:**

Now, try to fit all the clues together.  Since the tulips are in the middle, and the phone has to be to the left of the TV, the phone must be in house 1 and the TV in house 2.  

The lilies have to be to the right of the phone, so they must be in house 4. The daffodils can't be in house 4, and they have to be to the right of the radio, so they must be in house 5.

That leaves house 4 for the radio and house 5 for the daffodils.

Finally, the roses have to be to the left of the carnations, so the carnations must be in house 5.



**Answer:** The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number **(E) 5**.
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's try to figure it out step by step.

We have a lot of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

* We know the cricketer is in house number 2 and the fish enthusiast is also in house number 2.  That means they must be the same person!

* The golfer is in house number 4.

* The bird keeper is in house number 1.

* The person wearing loafers lives next to the cricketer, so they must be in house number 1 or 3.

Let me know if you want to keep working on it together!  We can use the other clues to figure out the rest.

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The radio and truck are next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The radio is to the left of the pizza.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover isn't in house number 1.
* **Clue 4:** Grapes are to the left of the computer.

Let's try putting this information together. Since the radio is left of the pizza, and they are next to each other, it can't be house number 2.  That means the radio and pizza must be in house number 1.

**So the answer is (B) 1** 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Tea drinker 
* **House 2:** Pizza eater (clue 5)

**2. Use the clues to fill in more:**

* **Clue 2:** Milk drinker is left of Spaghetti eater.
* **Clue 6:** Spaghetti eater is left of Water drinker.

This means the order so far could be: Milk - Spaghetti - Water - ?

* **Clue 4:** White and Water drinker are next to each other.

This means the order is now: Milk - Spaghetti - White - Water

* **Clue 3:** Coffee drinker is left of Yellow liker.

This means Coffee drinker must be in house 1 (since Tea is already there).

* **Clue 7:** Green liker is not in house 1.
* **Clue 8:** Grilled cheese eater is not in house 1.

**3.  Putting it all together:**

* House 1: Tea drinker, Coffee drinker
* House 2: Pizza eater
* House 3: Spaghetti eater
* House 4: White, Water drinker

Since Green liker isn't in house 1, and we've filled the rest, the Green liker must be in **House 4**.

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in the third house.

**2. Use the clues to fill in more information:**

* **Clue 2:** The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who drinks water lives in house number 4.
* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

**3. Keep connecting the clues:**

* **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
* **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.

**4.  Now we can figure out where the person who likes red lives:**

Since we know the dog owner is in house 3, the person who drinks water is in house 4, and the person who owns horses is in house 4,  and there's one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV, the person who likes red must live in **house 2**.



**So the answer is (C) 2**

"This is a tricky one!  It's like a puzzle.  

Let's see... we have lots of clues about who lives where and what they like.

* **Clue 3** tells us the soccer player is in house number 3.
* **Clue 5** says the tulips aren't in house number 3.

* **Clue 1** says the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.  

Let's try putting this information into a table:

| House | Sport | Lunch | Flowers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 | Soccer |  |  |

* **Clue 2** says lilies are to the left of grilled cheese.

This means grilled cheese can't be in house 1.

* **Clue 4** says grilled cheese is to the left of spaghetti.

Let's try putting it all together:

| House | Sport | Lunch | Flowers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Golfer |  | Lilies |
| 2 |  | Grilled Cheese |  |
| 3 | Soccer | Spaghetti | Tulips |

So the answer is **(B) 2**. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

* **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

* **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start filling in a table to keep track:

| House | Shoes      | Lunch        | Drink      |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     |            |              |            |
| 2     |            |              |            |
| 3     |            |              | Tea        |
| 4     |            |              |            |

* We know the tea drinker is in house 3.

Now let's use the other clues:

* **Clue 5:** Running shoes are to the left of stew.
* **Clue 2:** Stew is to the left of spaghetti.

This means the order so far could be: Running shoes - Stew - Spaghetti

Let's add that to our table:

| House | Shoes      | Lunch        | Drink      |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | Running Shoes|              |            |
| 2     |            | Stew         |            |
| 3     |            | Spaghetti    | Tea        |
| 4     |            |              |            |

* **Clue 7:** Grilled cheese isn't in house 1.

* **Clue 4:** Water is to the right of grilled cheese.

This means grilled cheese can be in house 2 and water in house 3:

| House | Shoes      | Lunch        | Drink      |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | Running Shoes|              |            |
| 2     |            | Grilled Cheese|            |
| 3     |            | Spaghetti    | Tea        |
| 4     |            |              | Water      |

* **Clue 6:** High heels are next to water.

This means high heels must be in house 3:

| House | Shoes      | Lunch        | Drink      |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | Running Shoes|              |            |
| 2     |            | Grilled Cheese|            |
| 3     | High Heels | Spaghetti    | Tea        |
| 4     |            |              | Water      |

* Now we just need to figure out the last lunch and drink, and the sandals.  We know root beer is to the right of sandals.  The only spot left for sandals is house 1, and root beer must be in house 4.

| House | Shoes      | Lunch        | Drink      |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1     | Running Shoes| Sandals      | Root Beer   |
| 2     |            | Grilled Cheese|            |
| 3     | High Heels | Spaghetti    | Tea        |
| 4     |            |              | Water      |

Finally, the only lunch left is fried rice, so it must be in house 2, and milk is the only drink left, so it must be for the person in house 2.

This means the person with the computer lives in house number 4.

**So the answer is (A) 4**

* House 1: Pianist 
* House 2:  We know it's not the horse owner, and it's not the white lover.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner, the horse owner must be in house 1.  That means the dog owner must be in **house 2**.


**Answer: (B) 2**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

This means the percussionist can't be in house 4 (because the history book buff would have to be in house 5, and there are only 4 houses). So the percussionist must be in house **3**.

| 3 |  |  |  |  |

* **Clue 2:** The loafer wearer and the red lover live next to each other.

This means the white lover must be in house 1.

Now our table looks like this:

| 2 |  |  |  | Science Fiction |
| 3 |  | Tulips |  |  |

* **Clue 4** says the lilies are in house number 2.
* **Clue 3** says the lilies are to the right of the tulips. This means the tulips must be in house number 1.

That leaves house number **3** for the roses!

This means the gameboy must be in house 3 or 4.

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

Since the person who likes yellow is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 4.

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 3** tells us the mango eater lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** says the saxophonist doesn't live in house number 1.
* Since there are only two houses, the saxophonist must live in house number 2.
* **Clue 1** says the roses are to the left of the lilies.  This means the roses must be in house number 1 and the lilies in house number 2.

We know the mango eater is in house 1, and the saxophonist is in house 2.  That means the person eating apples must be in house number **2**. 

**So the answer is (B).**

* **Clue 2:** The SUV is right next to the lilies.

* **Clue 3:** The sedan and the roses are next to each other.

* **Clue 4:** The roses aren't in the second house.

Okay, let's think about what we know. Since the roses aren't in the second house, and they have to be next to the sedan, they must be in house 1 and the sedan in house 2.

That means the lilies and the SUV must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the tulips can't be in house 3, they must be in house 1.

That leaves the truck for house 3!

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Yellow, Kiwis 
* **House 4:** Convertible

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house. (We already knew this!)
* **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. (We already knew this!)
* **Clue 13:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. (We already knew this!)
* **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. This means the cricketer can be in houses 1, 2, or 3.
* **Clue 3:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 6:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
* **Clue 10:** The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.

* **Clue 12:** The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 14:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.

**3.  Keep filling in the blanks:**

Since we know the cricketer is to the left of the convertible (house 4), and there's one house between the swimmer and cricketer, the swimmer must be in house 2 and the cricketer in house 3.

Now we know:

* **House 1:** Yellow, Kiwis
* **House 2:** Swimmer
* **House 3:** Cricketer, SUV, Blue
* **House 4:** Convertible

* **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house. (Oops! We need to adjust our thinking here)

Let's try again, knowing the SUV can't be in house 3:

* **House 1:** Yellow, Kiwis
* **House 2:** Swimmer, Banana
* **House 3:** Cricketer, White
* **House 4:** Convertible,  

* **Clue 8:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.

This means the SUV must be in house 1!

* **House 1:** Yellow, Kiwis, SUV
* **House 2:** Swimmer, Banana
* **House 3:** Cricketer, White
* **House 4:** Convertible

Now we can fill in the rest:

* **House 1:** Yellow, Kiwis, SUV, Mangoes
* **House 2:** Swimmer, Banana, Minivan
* **House 3:** Cricketer, White, Blue
* **House 4:** Convertible, Oranges, Basketball Player

| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  | Green |

**3.  Connect the clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other. Since green is in house 3, yellow must be in house 2.
* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.

**4. Keep going:**

* **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means stew can't be in house 3.

**5.  Fill in the rest:**

Since stew can't be in house 3 and the romance book lover is to the right of the stew eater, stew must be in house 1 and the romance book lover in house 2.

| House | Book | Lunch | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  | Stew |  |
| 2 | Romance |  | Yellow |

* **Clue 7:** Carnations are in house 1.

   This means tulips must be in house 2 and the bird keeper is in either house 2 or 3.

* House 4: Carnations

* **Clue 1:** Mystery reader and swimmer have one house between them.
* **Clue 4:** Fantasy book lover is left of the swimmer.
* **Clue 9:** Two houses between mystery reader and romance lover.

Let's try putting the mystery reader in house 2:

* House 1: ?
* House 2: Daffodils, Mystery Reader
* House 3: Roses
* House 4: Carnations

This works! The swimmer would be in house 4, and the romance lover would be in house 1.

* **Clue 1:** The pianist and the kiwi eater are neighbors.
* **Clue 2:** The flutist is to the right of the violinist.
* **Clue 3:** The grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist is one house away from the kiwi eater.

Let's try putting this together. Since the violinist and kiwi eater are one house apart, and the grape eater is also one house away from the kiwi eater, they must be in the middle.  

This means the pianist must be in either house 1 or house 3.

Since the flutist is to the right of the violinist, the violinist can't be in house 3.

**Therefore, the pianist must live in house 1. So the answer is (C).** 



"
"The answer is **(B) 2**. Here's why:

* We know the person in house number 1 eats kiwis.
* We also know the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in house number 1. 

That means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house number 2. 



"
"The answer is (D) 3.

Here's how we know:

* **Clue 8** tells us the person who likes red lives in the third house. 


Let me know if you want to try and figure out the rest!
"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover doesn't live in house number 2. 
* **Clue 2:** The pianist lives to the left of the cellist. This means the pianist is in house number 1 and the cellist is in house number 2.

Since the root beer lover doesn't live in house 2, they must live in **house number 1**.

**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 7:** The person with carnations lives in house number 5.
* **Clue 1:** The person with boots lives next to the person with carnations, so they must be in house number 4.

**2. Use the clues about tulips:**

* **Clue 5:** Tulips are to the right of daffodils.
* **Clue 6:** Tulips are not in house 4.

**3. Combine clues:**

* Since tulips are right of daffodils and not in house 4, tulips must be in house 3 and daffodils in house 2.

**4.  More connections:**

* **Clue 2:** Loafers are to the right of tulips, so loafers are in house 2.
* **Clue 8:** Daffodils and running shoes are next to each other, so running shoes are in house 1.

**5. The last piece:**

* The only house left is house 3, and the only flower left is lilies.


**Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 3. The answer is (C).** 

"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  It's like a detective game where we have to use the clues to figure out who lives where.

Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we need to be careful and organized.  

I'm going to try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

* **House #** | **Instrument** | **Color** | **Sport** | **Fruit** | **Drink**
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1       |          |          |          |          |          
2       |          |          |          |          |          
3       |          |          |          |          |          
4       |          |          |          |          |          

Okay, now let's look at the clues one by one and see if we can fill in our chart.  

This is going to take some time, but I'll do my best! 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Likes white (clue 2)
* **House 2:** Likes green (clue 4)

**2. Use the clues to fill in more:**

* **Clue 1:** High heels are not in house 3.
* **Clue 3:** Spaghetti is not in house 2.
* **Clue 5:** Boots are left of high heels.
* **Clue 6:** Boots are left of stew.
* **Clue 7:** Stew is not in house 2.

**3.  Let's put it together:**

Since boots are left of high heels, and high heels aren't in house 3, the boots must be in house 1 and the high heels in house 2.

We know stew isn't in house 2, and boots are left of stew, so stew must be in house 3.

This leaves fried rice for house 2.

**Answer:** The person who ate fried rice lives in **(A) 2**. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 5** tells us the rose bouquet is in house number 2.

* **Clue 4** says the rose bouquet and the science fiction fan live next to each other. So, the science fiction fan must be in house number 3.

* **Clue 1** says the fantasy fan lives to the left of the science fiction fan, so they must be in house number 1.

* **Clue 3** says the romance lover is left of the tulips. Since the rose is in house 2, the romance lover must be in house 1 and the tulips in house 2.

* **Clue 2** says the romance lover is to the right of the carnations. This means the carnations must be in house 1.

* This leaves house number 4 for the lilies.


**So the answer is (C) 4** 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 2** tells us the science fiction fan lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 1** says the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since house 1 is on the left, the coffee drinker must live in house 1 and the sandal wearer in house 2.

* We know the science fiction fan is in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in **house 2**.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person with the radio.

This means the percussionist is in house number 1 and the person with the radio is in house number 2.

* **We know:**  Each person has a different device, so the person in house 2 with the radio must have the phone.


**Answer:** The person with the phone lives in house number **(B) 2**. 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The convertible is in the middle house (house number 2).

* **Clue 2:** The white and sedan houses have one house between them. This means they can't be next to each other.

* **Clue 3:** Yellow is right next to the sedan.

Let's try putting this together:

Since the convertible is in the middle, and yellow is next to the sedan, the only way this works is:

* House 1: White
* House 2: Convertible, Yellow
* House 3: Sedan 


So the answer is **(A) 1**.
"
"Let's break this down step by step. It's like a puzzle!

Here's what we know for sure:

* **House 1:** Running shoes
* **House 3:** Sedan 
* **House 3:** Not the dog owner

We also know some things about where people *don't* live:

* **House 4:** Not high heels
* **House 3:** Not the fish enthusiast
* **House 5:** Not loafers
* **House 5:** Not the fish enthusiast
* **House 1:** Not the dog owner

Let's use the clues about the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast to figure out more:

* **Clue 4:** Sandals are to the left of the bird keeper.
* **Clue 5:** Two houses between running shoes (House 1) and the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must be in House 4.
* **Clue 7:** Fish enthusiast is to the right of the SUV owner.
* **Clue 13:** Horse owner is to the right of the minivan owner.

Now we can start filling in the blanks!

Since the bird keeper is in House 4, and the fish enthusiast is to the right, the fish enthusiast must be in House 5.

We know the horse owner is to the right of the minivan owner, but we don't know where they are yet.

Let's look at the clues about the high heels and the truck:

* **Clue 9:** High heels are directly left of the truck.

This means the high heels must be in House 2 and the truck in House 3.

Now we can fill in more:

* **House 1:** Running shoes
* **House 2:** High heels
* **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
* **House 4:** Bird keeper, Sandals
* **House 5:** Fish enthusiast

We still need to figure out the loafers, the cat lover, the dog owner, and where the minivan and horse owner are.

Since the dog owner isn't in Houses 1 or 3, and the minivan owner must be to the left of the horse owner, the only place left for the dog owner is House 2.

This means the loafers must be in House 5.

Finally, the minivan owner must be in House 2 and the horse owner in House 4.

So the answer is **(C) 4**. The person who owns horses lives in House 4.

"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's try to figure it out step by step.

It's like a big matching game. We need to use the clues to figure out who lives where and what they have.

I'm going to try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

* **House Number** | **Flowers** | **Car** | **Fruit** | **Pet** | **Shoes**
*---|---|---|---|---|---|
* 1 |  |  |  |  |  
* 2 |  |  |  |  |

* **Clue 4** tells us the fantasy book enthusiast also lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 1** says the spaghetti eater is to the left of the fried rice eater, so they must be in house number 1.

* **Clue 2** says the science fiction fan is to the left of the fried rice eater, so they must be in house number 1.

This means the grilled cheese eater must be in house number **3**. 

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"The answer is **(B) 1**.

Here's why:

* We know the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. 
* Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, the only way for someone to be to the left is if they live in house number 1. 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 3** tells us the person eating kiwis lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 1** says the water drinker is to the left of the person wearing high heels.

* Since house 2 is on the right, the person in house 1 must be the one wearing high heels.


So the answer is **(A) 1**. 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** High heels are to the left of sandals.
* **Clue 2:** Grapes and sandals are next to each other.

This means the person with high heels must be in house 1, and the person with sandals is in house 2.

* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker is to the left of the person with the television.

Since house 1 is on the left, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with the television is in house 2.

We know the person in house 2 has sandals and the television.  We also know grapes and sandals are together, so the person in house 2 is eating grapes.

That means the person in house 1 must be eating kiwis!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 3** tells us the tea drinker lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 4** says the violinist doesn't live in house number 3.

* **Clue 2** says the violinist and guitarist live with one house between them.  Since the violinist can't be in house 3, they must be in house 1. This means the guitarist is in house 3.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 7** tells us the person who likes milk lives in house number 3.
* **Clue 1** says the person wearing sandals lives in house number 3.
* **Clue 3** says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.  

Since the person in house 3 wears sandals, the person who drinks water must live in house number **2**.

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.

**4.  Think it through:**

Since the pizza eater is in house 4, and the grilled cheese eater is to the left, grilled cheese must be in house 3.  Spaghetti is to the right of grilled cheese, so spaghetti must be in house 4.

* **Clue 2:** The percussionist doesn't live in house number 2.

* **Putting it together:** Since the bird keeper isn't in house 2, and the percussionist isn't in house 2, the guitarist must live in house 2.  

* **Final step:**  We know the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper must be in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2.  Since the guitarist is in house 2, they must have had the grilled cheese. This means the person in house 1 had the pizza.


**Answer:** (B) 1 

"
"The answer is **(A) 3**.

We know this because clue number 2 tells us directly that the bird keeper lives in the third house. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the knowns:**

* **House 1:** Cat lover 
* **House 2:**  We know a lot of things DON'T live here (loafer wearer, percussionist, fantasy book enthusiast, history book buff).

**2. Use the clues to fill in the rest:**

* **Clue 5:** Fish enthusiast is to the right of the banana eater.
* **Clue 6:** Flutist is to the right of the fish enthusiast.
* **Clue 7:** Orange eater is to the right of the pianist.
* **Clue 8:** Fish enthusiast is to the right of the running shoe wearer.
* **Clue 9:** Fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the flutist.

**3.  Think about the possibilities:**

Since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and orange eater all have to be to the right of someone else, they can't be in House 1. This means they must be in Houses 2 and 3.

**4.  Put it all together:**

* **House 1:** Cat lover
* **House 2:**  We still don't know everything, but we know it's NOT the loafer wearer, percussionist, fantasy book enthusiast, or history book buff.
* **House 3:** This house likely has the fish enthusiast, flutist, and orange eater.

* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, but we don't know the order yet.

Let's try combining the clues:

* If the cellist is in house 1, and the history buff is in house 1, then the mystery reader and cat lover must be in house 2.  This would mean the root beer lover and guitarist are in house 2 as well, which doesn't work because they have to be next to each other.

* This means the cellist and history buff must BOTH be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the mystery reader, cat lover, root beer lover, and guitarist.

Since we know the root beer lover and guitarist are next to each other, they must be in house 2.  

We don't have enough information to know for sure who owns the horses, but we know they can't be in house 1 because the cellist and history buff are there.

**So the answer is (B) 2.**

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper can't be in house number 3.

* **Clue 2:** The dog owner doesn't live in house number 2.

* **Clue 3:** The tulips are to the right of the dog owner.

Let's try putting this together.  If the dog owner isn't in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or 3.  

If the dog owner is in house 1, the tulips would have to be in house 2 or 3. But clue 1 says the carnations are to the right of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper can't be in house 3. This means the tulips would have to be in house 2.

If the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips would have to be in house 2. This works with all the clues!


**So the answer is (B) 2.**

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

**Using the clues:**

1. **Clue 1:** High heels are left of tulips.
2. **Clue 4:** Swimmer is in house 4.
3. **Clue 6:** Tulips are directly left of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 11:** Rose bouquet is directly left of the banana eater.

Let's start filling in our table:

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  | Swimmer |  |  |

Now we know the swimmer is in house 4.  We also know tulips are left of the cricketer, so they can't be in house 4.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The mango eater lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 2 & 5:** The horse owner doesn't live in house 1 or 2.

* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and kiwi eater are next to each other.

* **Clue 6:** The banana eater is to the left of the dog owner.

* **Clue 4:** The banana eater doesn't live in house 3.

Let's put it all together:

1. **House 1:** Mango eater
2. **House 2:**  Could be the kiwi eater and bird keeper, or the banana eater and dog owner.
3. **House 3:** Could be the horse owner, or the banana eater and dog owner.
4. **House 4:** Could be the horse owner, or the kiwi eater and bird keeper.

Since the banana eater can't be in house 3, and they are left of the dog owner, the only option for house 2 is the banana eater and dog owner. This means the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in house 4.


**Answer:** The bird keeper lives in house **(B) 4**.

Here's what we know:

* **House 2:** The soccer player lives here.

* **Clue 6:** The rose bouquet is directly left of the spaghetti eater.

* **Clue 1:** Stew eater is to the right of the high heels wearer.

* **Clue 2:** Daffodils and the golfer have one house between them.

* **Clue 3:** The golfer is to the right of the rose bouquet.

* **Clue 5:** Stew eater is to the left of the history book reader.

* **Clue 7:** Running shoes wearer is to the right of the stew eater.

* **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader is NOT in house 2.

Let's try to fill in a chart:

| House | Shoes | Book | Lunch | Flowers | Sport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  | Soccer |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |

Now, let's use the clues:

* **Clue 6:** Since the rose bouquet is left of the spaghetti eater, they can't be in house 3.

* **Clue 3:** The golfer is right of the rose bouquet, so they can't be in house 1.

* **Clue 2:** Daffodils and the golfer have one house between them, meaning they can't be in the same house or next to each other.

* **Clue 5:** Stew eater is left of the history book reader.

* **Clue 1:** Stew eater is right of the high heels wearer.

* **Clue 7:** Running shoes wearer is right of the stew eater.

Let's try putting some things in our chart:

| House | Shoes | Book | Lunch | Flowers | Sport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | High Heels |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  | Soccer |
| 3 | Running Shoes |  | Stew |  | Golfer |

Now we know:

* The stew eater is in house 3.
* The golfer is in house 3.
* The running shoes wearer is in house 3.

We also know the daffodils and golfer can't be together, so the daffodils must be in house 1.

| House | Shoes | Book | Lunch | Flowers | Sport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  | Daffodils |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  | Soccer |
| 3 | Running Shoes |  | Stew |  | Golfer |

Now, let's think about the remaining clues:

* **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader isn't in house 2.

This means they must be in house 1 or 3.

We still need to figure out who eats spaghetti, who likes history books, and who wears loafers.

Since we don't have enough information to figure out the rest, we can't be sure where the carnations are. 

**So the answer is: We can't know for sure!**

"Let's try to figure this out step-by-step!

* **Clue 1:** Phone is left of the minivan.
* **Clue 2:** Truck and Gameboy are next to each other.

* **Clue 4:** High heels and Television are next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** Minivan is right of the truck.
* **Clue 6:** Flutist is left of the minivan.
* **Clue 7:** Boots are right of the percussionist.

Okay, let's see... if the minivan is right of the truck (Clue 5) and the flutist is left of the minivan (Clue 6), that means the order must be Truck - Flutist - Minivan.

Since the phone is left of the minivan (Clue 1), the phone must be in house 1.

The truck and gameboy are together (Clue 2), and the minivan is right of the truck (Clue 5), so the order is Truck - Gameboy - Minivan.

The cellist is next to the minivan (Clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 3.

The high heels and television are together (Clue 4), and we know the phone is in house 1, so the high heels and television must be in houses 2 and 3.

Finally, the boots are right of the percussionist (Clue 7), so the percussionist must be in house 1.

* **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

**3. Now let's start putting the pieces together:**

Since the minivan is left of the stew, and the stew is left of the lilies, the order must be minivan - stew - lilies.

Clue 3 tells us the rose bouquet is left of the truck.

* **Clue 2:** Oranges are in House 1.
* **Clue 4:** Banana is in House 4.
* **Clue 9:** SUV is in House 4.
* **Clue 7:** Daffodils are to the left of the minivan.
* **Clue 3:** Apples are to the left of Daffodils.

**3.  Put it together:**

Since Daffodils are left of the minivan, and Apples are left of Daffodils, we know the order so far could be:

* Apples - Daffodils - Minivan

**4. More clues:**

* **Clue 1:** Tulips are left of the Convertible.
* **Clue 5:** Sedan is right of Carnations.
* **Clue 6:** One house between Carnations and Lilies.

**5.  Deduce:**

* We know House 4 is Banana/SUV, and House 1 is Oranges.
* This means the order must be:

1. Oranges
2. Apples
3. Daffodils
4. Banana/SUV
5.  

*  Since Tulips are left of the Convertible, and Sedan is right of Carnations, the Sedan must be in House 3.

**Answer:** The person who owns a sedan lives in **House 3 (A)**. 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 4** tells us the soccer player lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 1** says the blue lover lives to the left of the root beer lover. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the root beer lover must live in house **2**.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's try to figure it out step by step. 

We have a lot of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Since the daffodils are in the second house, and the yellow lover is to the left of the daffodils, the yellow lover must be in house number 1.

Let me know if you want to keep working through the clues together! 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The violinist lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 2:** The person with the computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since house 1 is on the left, the bird keeper must live in house number 2.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house.
* **Clue 20:** The person with the gameboy lives in the first house.
* **Clue 10:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 12:** The person who has a television lives in the third house.

**2. Use clues to connect information:**

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 5.

* **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

* **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

**3.  Keep connecting clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The person with carnations lives directly left of the person wearing running shoes.
* **Clue 14:** The person with carnations lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 9:** The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 19:** The person with daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person with tulips.
* **Clue 18:** The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with daffodils.

**4.  Fill in the gaps:**

Since we know the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth houses have the rose bouquet, gameboy, boots, pizza, and spaghetti, respectively, we can deduce the rest:

* House 1: Rose bouquet, Gameboy
* House 2: Boots
* House 3: Television, Grilled Cheese
* House 4: Pizza,  
* House 5: Spaghetti

Now, using the remaining clues, we can figure out the rest of the items and their corresponding houses.

**5. The Answer:**

By carefully piecing together all the clues, we can determine that the person with the **computer lives in house number 5**.



**Therefore, the answer is (E).**
"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The person in the second house wears boots.
* **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the dog owner.  Since the first house is taken, the high heel wearer must be in house 2 and the dog owner in house 3.
* **Clue 3:** The sedan is in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The SUV is to the left of the boots. This means the SUV must be in house 1.

Now we know:

* House 1: Cat lover, SUV
* House 2: Boots, High Heels
* House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

That leaves running shoes for the person in **House 1**.

**So the answer is (B) 1** 



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with carnations lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person with tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

So we know:

* House 1: Carnations, Running Shoes
* House 2: Tulips
* House 3: Tea

* **Clue 2:** The kiwi eater lives to the left of the blue lover.
* **Clue 6:** The boots wearer lives to the left of the green lover.
* **Clue 8:** The orange eater doesn't live in the third house.

This means the kiwi eater, blue lover, boots wearer, and green lover can't all be in the third house.

* **Clue 3:** The milk drinker and apple eater live next to each other.

Let's try putting the pieces together. Since the third house is taken, the milk drinker and apple eater must be in houses 1 and 2. 

**Therefore, the apple eater lives in house 1 or 2.**

We don't have enough clues to know for sure which one.  



"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 2** tells us the mystery book reader lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 1** says the mystery book reader lives to the left of the history buff, so the history buff must be in house number 2.
* **Clue 4** says the mystery book reader (house 1) lives left of the person with the television, so the person with the television is in house 2.
* **Clue 3** says the computer is to the right of the phone.  This means the phone must be in house 1 and the computer in house 3.

Since the mystery reader is in house 1, the history buff in house 2, and the person with the TV in house 2, the science fiction fan must be in **house 3**.

**So the answer is (B) 3**
