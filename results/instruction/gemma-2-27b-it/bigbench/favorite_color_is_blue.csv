"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.

* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.

* **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's consider the possibilities:

* **If the pianist is in house 1:**  This would put the guitarist in house 3, the tulips in house 2, and the lilies in house 1. This arrangement works with all the clues.

* **If the pianist is in house 3:** This would put the guitarist in house 1, the tulips in house 4, and the lilies in house 3. This doesn't work because the flutist is in house 2.

**Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 2.**

**Answer: (A)**

* Clue 10 tells us the phone user is in house 3.
* Clue 5 tells us the blue lover is either in house 1 or 3, and the phone user is in house 3. So, the blue lover must be in house 1.
* Clue 9 tells us the loafer wearer is next to the computer user, so the loafer wearer must be in house 2.
* Clue 8 tells us the mango eater is to the left of the yellow lover. Since the loafer wearer is in house 2, the mango eater must be in house 1 and the yellow lover in house 2.
* Clue 4 tells us the grape eater is to the right of the boots wearer. Since the yellow lover is in house 2, the boots wearer must be in house 1 and the grape eater in house 3.
* This leaves the apple eater in house 3.
* Finally, we know the pizza eater isn't in house 2, and the only remaining option is house 3.

| 5     |          |            |            |

**2. Use the Clues**

Let's go through the clues and fill in the grid:

* **Clue 1:** Gameboy is to the right of the guitarist.
* **Clue 2:** Dog owner is not in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** Fish enthusiast and horse owner are next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** Flutist is left of the television.
* **Clue 5:** Television is left of the radio.
* **Clue 6:** Guitarist is right of the percussionist.
* **Clue 7:** Television is left of the gameboy.
* **Clue 8:** Violinist is in the fourth house.
* **Clue 9:** Two houses between phone and horse owner.
* **Clue 10:** Bird keeper is in the fifth house.

**3. Deduce and Fill**

Now we can start making deductions:

* **From Clue 8:** We know the violinist is in house number 4.
* **From Clue 10:** The bird keeper is in house number 5.
* **From Clue 3:** Since the fish enthusiast and horse owner are next to each other, and we know the bird keeper is in house 5, the fish enthusiast and horse owner must be in houses 3 and 4 (in some order).
* **From Clue 9:** There are two houses between the phone and the horse owner. This means the phone must be in house 1.

Let's update our grid:

| House | Pet      | Instrument | Device     |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |          |            | Phone      |
| 2     |          |            |            |
| 3     |          |            |            |
| 4     |          | Violinist   |            |
| 5     | Bird     |            |            |

* **From Clue 7:** The television is left of the gameboy. This means they must be in houses 2 and 3 (in some order).
* **From Clue 4:** The flutist is left of the television. This means the flutist must be in house 1.

Our grid now looks like this:

| House | Pet      | Instrument | Device     |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |          | Flutist     | Phone      |

| 3     |          |            | Gameboy    |
| 4     |          | Violinist   |            |
| 5     | Bird     |            |            |

* **From Clue 1:** The gameboy is to the right of the guitarist. This means the guitarist must be in house 2.
* **From Clue 6:** The guitarist is right of the percussionist. This means the percussionist must be in house 1.

Finally, our completed grid is:

| House | Pet      | Instrument | Device     |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |          | Percussionist| Phone      |
| 2     |          | Guitarist   | Television |
| 3     |          |            | Gameboy    |
| 4     |          | Violinist   |            |
| 5     | Bird     |            |            |



**Answer:** The percussionist lives in **house number 1 (A)**.

* **Clue 2:** The white lover lives to the left of the spaghetti eater. Since the spaghetti eater is in house 2, the white lover must be in house 1.

* **Clue 4:** The water drinker lives next to the spaghetti eater.  This confirms the spaghetti eater and water drinker are in house 2.

**2. Deduce:**

* We know house 1 has the runner and the white lover.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The pianist lives in the first house.

* **Clue 2:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the horse owner cannot be in the second house (since there's no one to their right).

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

**Putting it together:**

1. We know the pianist is in house 1.
2. Since the horse owner can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1.
3. This means the root beer lover is in house 2.
4. Because the white lover isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1.
5.  This leaves the dog owner to be in house 2.


**Answer:** (B) 2 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information with a grid:

| House | Book      | Lunch      | Instrument |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |           |            |            |
| 2     |           |            |            |
| 3     |           |            |            |
| 4     |           |            |            |

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives in the second house.

| House | Book      | Lunch      | Instrument |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |           |            |            |
| 2     |           | Stew       |            |
| 3     |           |            |            |
| 4     |           |            |            |

* **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

| House | Book      | Lunch      | Instrument |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1     |           |            |            |
| 2     |           | Stew       |            |
| 3     |           |            |            |
| 4     |           | Pizza      |            |

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

This means the order must be Science Fiction - Percussion - History.

* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

**3. Deduce the solution:**

Now we can start filling in the grid based on the clues and the order we've established:

| House | Book           | Lunch      | Instrument |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------|
| 1     | Science Fiction |            | Guitarist   |
| 2     |                | Stew       |            |
| 3     |                |            | Percussionist|
| 4     | History        | Pizza      | Violinist   |

Since the person who ate fried rice must be two houses away from the fantasy book enthusiast, and we know the violinist is in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house.  This also means the fried rice eater is in the first house.

| House | Book           | Lunch      | Instrument |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------|
| 1     | Science Fiction | Fried Rice | Guitarist   |
| 2     | Fantasy        | Stew       |            |
| 3     |                |            | Percussionist|
| 4     | History        | Pizza      | Violinist   |



**Therefore, the percussionist lives in house number 3. The answer is (B).**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 3** tells us the mango eater lives in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** tells us the saxophonist doesn't live in house number 1.
* **Clue 1** tells us the roses are to the left of the lilies. Since house 1 is on the left, it must have the roses.

This means:

* House 1: Mangoes, Roses, Pianist
* House 2: Apples, Lilies, Saxophonist


Therefore, the person eating apples lives in **house number 2 (B)**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information. Create a grid with three columns (House 1, House 2, House 3) and rows for Tulips, Roses, Lilies, Sedan, SUV, and Truck.

**2. Use the clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person with tulips doesn't live in house 3.  Mark this in your grid.
* **Clue 2:** The SUV is directly left of the lilies. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 (SUV in 1, Lilies in 2) or houses 2 and 3 (SUV in 2, Lilies in 3).
* **Clue 3:** The sedan and roses are next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** The roses are not in house 2.

**3. Deduce:**

* Since roses aren't in house 2, and they must be next to the sedan, the sedan must be in house 1 and the roses in house 2.
*  Knowing the SUV is left of the lilies, the only remaining option is SUV in house 1 and lilies in house 2.
* This leaves house 3 for the truck.


**Answer:** The person who drives a truck lives in **(C) 3**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other. Since green is in the third house, yellow must be in the second house.

**3.  More deductions:**

* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.

* **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means stew can't be in the third house (because there's no one to the right).

**4. Putting it together:**

* We know green is in house 3, yellow is in house 2.
* Stew must be in house 1 (because it can't be in 3 and must be left of the romance lover).
* This means the romance lover is in house 2.
* The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

**5. Final step:**

We've accounted for green, yellow, stew, romance, and fantasy. This leaves blue for house 1. 


**Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1. The answer is (C).**

This means the first house has both the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist.

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

Since the first house is on the left, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the second house.

* **We know:**
    * House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, Cellist, Green
    * House 2:  Red

* **Therefore:** The mystery book reader must live in **House 2**. 


**Answer: (B) 2**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Combine Clues:**

* **Clue 1 & 4:** The pianist and kiwi eater are next to each other, and there's one house between the violinist and kiwi eater. This means the violinist can't be in house 3 (otherwise, there wouldn't be room for the kiwi eater and pianist).

* **Clue 3:** There's one house between the grape eater and kiwi eater.

**2.  Possible Arrangements:**

Considering the above, here are the possible arrangements:

* **Option 1:** Violinist - Kiwi Eater - Pianist
* **Option 2:** Kiwi Eater - Pianist - Grape Eater 

* **Option 3:** Grape Eater - Kiwi Eater - Pianist

**3. Apply Clue 2:**

* **Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist. This eliminates Option 1 (as the violinist is in the first house).

**4. Determine the Solution:**

This leaves us with Option 2 and Option 3.  We don't have enough information to definitively say which fruit the pianist eats, but we can determine the pianist's house number:

* **Option 2:** The pianist is in house 2.
* **Option 3:** The pianist is in house 3.


**Therefore, the pianist could live in either house 2 or house 3. ** 

"
"The answer is **(B) 2**. Here's why:

* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. 

Since the kiwi eater is in house number 1, and the fantasy enthusiast isn't, the fantasy enthusiast must be in house number 2. 



"
"The answer is **(D) 3**. 

Here's how we can deduce that:

* **Clue 8** directly states that the person who likes red lives in the third house. 


Let me know if you'd like to try and figure out the rest of the clues! 

"
"The root beer lover lives in **house number 1**. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The pianist lives directly left of the cellist. This means the pianist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2.

Since the root beer lover isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1. 



"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 7:** The person with carnations lives in the fifth house.
* **Clue 1:** The boots wearer and the carnations person are next to each other. This means the boots wearer is in house 4.

**2.  Use the clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 2:** The tulips person is directly left of the loafers person.
* **Clue 5:** The tulips person is to the right of the daffodils person.
* **Clue 8:** The daffodils person and the running shoes person are next to each other.

**3.  Combine the information:**

Since the tulips person is to the right of the daffodils person, and the daffodils person is next to the running shoes person, the order must be: daffodils - running shoes - tulips - loafers.

**4.  Place the remaining elements:**

* We know the carnations person is in house 5 and the boots person is in house 4.
* This leaves houses 1, 2, and 3 for the lilies, roses, and sandals.

**5.  Deduce the final placement:**

* **Clue 3:** The sandals person doesn't live in house 5.
* **Clue 6:** The tulips person doesn't live in house 4.

Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:

* House 1: Lilies
* House 2: Roses
* House 3: Sandals
* House 4: Boots
* House 5: Carnations 



**Answer:** The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house **(A) 1**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a table:**

It's helpful to visualize the information. Create a table with columns for House Number, Food, Color, and Shoes.

**2. Fill in the knowns:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

| House Number | Food      | Color   | Shoes        |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1           |           | White   |              |
| 2           |           | Green   |              |
| 3           |           |         |              |

**3. Use the remaining clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

Considering these clues, the only possible arrangement is:

| House Number | Food      | Color   | Shoes        |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1           |           | White   | Boots        |
| 2           |           | Green   | High Heels   |
| 3           |           |         |              |

* **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.

This means the person in house 1 ate spaghetti.

| House Number | Food      | Color   | Shoes        |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1           | Spaghetti | White   | Boots        |
| 2           |           | Green   | High Heels   |
| 3           |           |         |              |

Now, the only options left are fried rice and stew for houses 2 and 3. Since the person who had stew is to the right of the person wearing boots (Clue 6), the person in house 3 ate stew and the person in house 2 ate fried rice.

| House Number | Food      | Color   | Shoes        |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1           | Spaghetti | White   | Boots        |
| 2           | Fried Rice| Green   | High Heels   |
| 3           | Stew      |         |              |



**Answer:** The person who ate fried rice lives in **house number 2 (A)**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.

**2. Use the clues to build connections:**

* **Clue 4:** The rose bouquet person and the science fiction fan live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in house 2, the science fiction fan must be in house 3.
* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction fan. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.
* **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the tulips.  
* **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives to the right of the carnations.

**3.  Deduce the remaining positions:**

* Since the romance lover is to the right of the carnations, and the tulips are to the right of the romance lover, the order must be: carnations, romance, tulips.

* This means the lilies must be in house 4.



**Therefore, the answer is (C) 4.** 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2** tells us the science fiction fan lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 1** tells us the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since house 1 is on the left, the coffee drinker must live in house 1 and the sandal wearer in house 2.

* This leaves house number **2** for the romance book lover.

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.  

Combining clues 2 and 3, we know the sedan must be in house 3 and the yellow-lover in house 2.


**Therefore, the answer is (B) 2.** 

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

It's helpful to create a grid to keep track of the information.  We'll have columns for House Number, Shoes, Car, and Pet.

**2. Fill in the Grid:**

* **Clue 1:** Running shoes are in House 1.
* **Clue 2:** Sedan is in House 3.
* **Clue 3:** Dog owner is NOT in House 3.
* **Clue 5:** Bird keeper is two houses away from the person with running shoes, so they are in House 3.
* **Clue 9:** High heels are directly left of the truck.

Let's update our grid:

| House | Shoes        | Car      | Pet        |
|-------|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1     | Running shoes |          |            |
| 2     |              |          |            |
| 3     |              | Sedan    | Bird keeper|
| 4     |              |          |            |
| 5     |              |          |            |

**3. Continue Deduction:**

* **Clue 4:** Sandals are to the left of the bird keeper, so they must be in House 2.
* **Clue 6:** High heels are NOT in House 4.
* **Clue 7:** Fish enthusiast is to the right of the SUV.
* **Clue 8:** Fish enthusiast is NOT in House 3.
* **Clue 10:** Loafers are NOT in House 5.
* **Clue 11:** Fish enthusiast is NOT in House 5.
* **Clue 12:** Dog owner is NOT in House 1.
* **Clue 13:** Horses are to the right of the minivan.

Now our grid looks like this:

| House | Shoes        | Car      | Pet        |
|-------|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1     | Running shoes |          |            |
| 2     | Sandals      |          |            |
| 3     |              | Sedan    | Bird keeper|
| 4     | High heels   | Truck    |            |
| 5     |              |          |            |

**4. Final Deductions:**

* Since the fish enthusiast is to the right of the SUV and not in Houses 3 or 5, they must be in House 4.
* This means the SUV is in House 3.
* The only remaining pet is the dog, and the only remaining house is House 5.
* The only remaining car is the minivan, and the only remaining shoes are the loafers.

**Solution:**

| House | Shoes        | Car      | Pet        |
|-------|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1     | Running shoes |          |            |
| 2     | Sandals      |          |            |
| 3     |              | Sedan    | Bird keeper|
| 4     | High heels   | Truck    | Fish enthusiast|
| 5     | Loafers      | Minivan  | Dog owner |

**Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 5. The answer is (E).**

"
"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 3** tells us the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
* **Clue 4** tells us the fantasy book enthusiast also lives in the second house. 

Since only one person can live in each house, this means the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

* **Clue 1** says the spaghetti eater lives to the left of the fried rice eater. This means the spaghetti eater must live in house number 1.
* **Clue 2** says the science fiction fan lives to the left of the fried rice eater.  

This means the science fiction fan must live in house number 1.

*  We know houses 1 and 2 are filled, so the grilled cheese eater must live in house number **3**.


**Answer: (C) 3** 

"
"The answer is **(B) 1**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information with a grid.  We'll have rows for each house (1-5) and columns for Device and Lunch.

**2. Use the Clues:**

* **Clue 1:** Gameboy and Computer are next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** Television is to the left of the Phone.
* **Clue 3:** One house between Grilled Cheese and Radio.
* **Clue 4:** One house between Gameboy and Fried Rice.
* **Clue 5:** Grilled Cheese is directly left of Spaghetti.
* **Clue 6:** Radio is not in house 4.
* **Clue 7:** Pizza is in house 4.
* **Clue 8:** Computer is not in house 4.

**3. Start Filling in the Grid:**

* **Clue 7** tells us Pizza is in house 4.
* **Clue 5** tells us Grilled Cheese is left of Spaghetti.

Let's start with a possible arrangement:

| House | Device     | Lunch        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1     |            |              |
| 2     |            | Grilled Cheese|
| 3     |            | Spaghetti    |

| 5     |            |              |

**4. Continue Deduction:**

* **Clue 3** says there's one house between Grilled Cheese and Radio. This means Radio must be in house 1.
* **Clue 6** says Radio is not in house 4. We already have it in house 1.

Now our grid looks like this:

| House | Device     | Lunch        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1     | Radio      |              |

| 3     |            | Spaghetti    |
| 4     |            | Pizza        |
| 5     |            |              |

* **Clue 1** says Gameboy and Computer are next to each other.  We can place them in houses 4 and 5 (or 5 and 4).

| House | Device     | Lunch        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1     | Radio      |              |
| 2     |            | Grilled Cheese|
| 3     |            | Spaghetti    |
| 4     |            | Pizza        |
| 5     |            |              |

* **Clue 4** says there's one house between Gameboy and Fried Rice. This means Fried Rice must be in house 2.

| House | Device     | Lunch        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1     | Radio      |              |
| 2     | Fried Rice | Grilled Cheese|
| 3     |            | Spaghetti    |
| 4     |            | Pizza        |
| 5     |            |              |

* Now we can deduce the rest:

| House | Device     | Lunch        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1     | Radio      |              |
| 2     | Fried Rice | Grilled Cheese|
| 3     | Television | Spaghetti    |
| 4     | Gameboy    | Pizza        |
| 5     | Computer   |              |



**Answer:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in **house 3**. So the answer is (E).

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid**

The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses numbered 1 through 5.  Then create columns for each category: Instrument, Sport, Fruit, Pet, and Lunch.

**2. Fill in the Grid Using the Clues**

Carefully go through each clue and fill in the grid. Some clues directly link two pieces of information, while others give you positional information (left, right, next to).

**3. Look for Chains of Deductions**

Often, one clue will lead to another. For example, if you know the pianist lives left of the horse owner, and you know the horse owner lives right of the grilled cheese eater, you can deduce the order of those three.

**4. Process of Elimination**

As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities. If you know someone eats apples and they can't be in house 2, cross out house 2 in the ""Apples"" column.

**I can't actually *show* you the grid here, but I can guide you through the process. Let me know if you'd like help with a specific clue or want to work through a section together!**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most definitive clues:**

* **Clue 6:** The person eating grapes lives in the second house.

**2.  Use connecting clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives to the right of the kiwi eater.
* **Clue 2:** The green and red lovers live next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** White and red lovers have one house between them.

**3. Combine the information:**

Since red is to the right of kiwi, and green is next to red, the order must be kiwi, then green, then red.  

White has to be one house away from red, meaning white must be in house 1.

**4.  More connections:**

* **Clue 3:** White and banana have one house between them. This means the banana eater must be in house 3.

* **Clue 4:** Green is to the left of yellow. This means yellow must be in house 4.

**5. The solution:**

Putting it all together:

* House 1: White
* House 2: Grapes
* House 3: Banana
* House 4: Yellow

Since red is to the right of kiwi, and kiwi must be before green, the kiwi eater must be in **House 1**.

* **Clue 9:** The person who likes red does not live in the second house.

This means the cellist must live in house 1 and the person who likes blue must live in house 2.

| House Number | Color    | Instrument | Device    |
|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1            | Blue     | Cellist     | Computer  |
| 2            | White    | Percussionist| Gameboy   |
| 3            | Yellow   |            | Phone     |

| 5            | Red      | Violinist   |           |

* **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.

This confirms our placement of the computer in house 1.

The only instrument left is the Saxophone, so it must be in house 4.

| House Number | Color    | Instrument | Device    |
|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1            | Blue     | Cellist     | Computer  |

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house. 

Since only one person can live in each house, this means the basketball player and the violinist are the same person, living in house number 2.

* **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in house number 3 (because the cellist would have to be in house number 4, and there are only 3 houses).

Therefore, the cricketer must be in house number 1, and the cellist in house number 3.

* **Process of elimination:** We know the violinist/basketball player is in house 2, the cricketer is in house 1, and the cellist is in house 3. This leaves house number 1 for the soccer player.

* This means the person in the first house must like green (clue 6) and wear boots.
* The third house has the tea drinker, and we know the person who likes blue is in the second house, so the person in the third house must like white.

**4. Final Deduction:**

"
"The answer is **(A) right midfielder**. Here's how we figure that out:

1. **Start:** Claire is a benchwarmer.

2. **Trades:** Claire only trades positions with Dave at the very end.

3. **Dave's Journey:** Dave starts as a cheerleader, then becomes a right winger, then a right midfielder, then a left midfielder, then a right midfielder again, and finally a benchwarmer.

4. **Claire's Final Position:** Since Dave ends as a benchwarmer, Claire must have taken his previous position, which was **right midfielder**.
