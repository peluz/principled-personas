"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 4:** The pianist lives one house away from the flutist, so the pianist must live in house number 3.

* **Clue 3:** The lilies are to the left of the carnations.  

* **Clue 2:** The tulips are to the left of the guitarist.

Let's put it all together:

1.  ?
2.  Flutist
3.  Pianist
4.  ?

Since the tulips are left of the guitarist, and the guitarist can't be in house 4 (the pianist is there), the tulips must be in house 1.


So the answer is **(C) 1**.

* **Cellist and Gameboy:** Have one house between them.
* **Blue and Gameboy:** Live next to each other.
* **Percussionist:** Doesn't live in house 2.

Hmm, this is tricky! Let me think...

Since the cellist and gameboy have a house between them, and the blue lover and gameboy live next to each other, maybe we can try drawing it out.

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The cellist must live in **house 2**.

* **Clue 2:** The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.

Let's put it all together:

"
"Let's try to figure this out step by step!

This means the person in house number 1 must like fantasy books, and they must have either spaghetti for lunch or a yellow favorite color, and they must have a phone or a cat.

* **Clue 1** says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the radio. Since house number 1 is on the left, the person in house number 2 must have the radio and like green.

This means the person in house number 2 must have the radio, like green, and they must have either pizza for lunch or a yellow favorite color, and they must have a fish or a cat.

Since we know the fish enthusiast doesn't live in house number 1, the **cat lover must live in house number 2**.

So the answer is **(B) 2**.

* **Clue 1** says the tulips are to the left of the dog owner.

* **Clue 2** says the daffodils are not in house number 2.

* **Clue 3** says there's one house between the horses and the carnations.

* **Clue 4** says the lilies are to the right of the horses.

Let's try putting this information together.  Since the cat lover is in house 1, and the tulips are to the left of the dog, the dog must be in house 2.

Now we know:

* House 1: Cat lover
* House 2: Dog owner

Because the daffodils aren't in house 2, and there's one house between the horses and carnations, the horses must be in house 3 and the carnations in house 4.

That leaves the lilies for house 3 and the fish enthusiast for house 4.


So the answer is **(D) 4**. 

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 3:** The horse owner and the person with the radio live next to each other. Since the phone is in house 1, the radio must be in house 2 and the horse owner must be in house 1.

Since the person in house 1 wears boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

* The person in the third house wears loafers (clue 6).
* The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the first or third house (clues 2 and 4), so they must live in the second house.
* Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and the person wearing boots lives right next to them, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.
* The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels (clue 1).  We know the person in the third house wears loafers, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house. This means the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

* We know the person who likes lilies lives to the right of the science fiction fan (clue 5). Since the second house is already full, the science fiction fan must live in the first house, and the lilies must be in the third house.

Now let's see what we have:

* House 1: Boots, High Heels, Science Fiction Fan
* House 2: Daffodils, Yellow, History Buff, Blue
* House 3: Loafers, Lilies

*The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.*

*The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.*

Let's keep looking at the clues...

Aha!

*There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.*

*The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.*

This means the person who ate spaghetti can't be in house number 4 because then the loafers person would be in house number 5 (and we know grilled cheese is in house 5).

Let's try house number 1. If the root beer lover is in house number 1, then the water drinker would have to be in house number 2 or 3.  But clue 2 says the water drinker is to the RIGHT of the root beer lover. So, the root beer lover can't be in house number 1.

*Clue 7* says the person eating oranges lives right next to the person eating apples.

"Let's try to figure this out step by step!

1. We know the TV person is in house number 4.

2. The loafers person is in house number 2.

3. The phone person is NOT in house number 2.

4. The boots person is somewhere to the left of the loafers person, so they must be in house number 1.

5. The radio and sandals people are two houses apart.  

Hmmm... let me think... if the boots are in house 1 and the loafers are in house 2, and the TV is in house 4, then the radio person must be in house 3 and the sandals person must be in house 1.

That leaves house number 3 for the gameboy!

* **Clue 1 tells us:** The cat lover and guitarist have one house between them.

* **Clue 2 tells us:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the cricketer.

* **Clue 4 tells us:** The pizza eater lives to the left of the dog owner.

Let's try putting this information together. Since the basketball player and saxophonist are in house 1, and the stew eater is to the left of the milk drinker, we can start like this:

1. Basketball player, Saxophonist, ?

Now, we know the cat lover and guitarist have one house between them.  We also know the tea drinker is left of the cricketer.  Let's try fitting those in:

1. Basketball player, Saxophonist, Tea drinker
2. Cat lover, Guitarist
3. Cricketer, ?

Finally, the pizza eater is left of the dog owner:

1. Basketball player, Saxophonist, Tea drinker

* **Clue 1** says the person with high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. This means the person with daffodils must be in house number 2.
* **Clue 4** says the person with loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer.  Since the daffodils are in house 2, the computer must be in house 1 and the loafers in house 2.

* **Clue 2** tells us the person who drinks water lives in house number 2.

* **Clue 3** says the root beer lover lives in house number 1.

* **Clue 1** says the daffodils are to the left of the phone. So, the daffodils can't be in house 3.

* **Clue 4** says the TV isn't in house 2.

* **Clue 5** says the TV is to the right of the tulips.

2. **House 2:** Water drinker, we don't know about flowers or device yet.
3. **House 3:** We don't know anything yet.

Since the daffodils are left of the phone, and the TV is right of the tulips, the only way this works is if:

"Let's try to figure this out step by step!

1. We know the person in house number 1 wears loafers.

2. The person with the phone lives to the left of the mango eater.

4. The boots person doesn't live in house number 3.

5. The kiwi eater lives next to the milk drinker.

6. The boots person lives to the right of the gameboy person.

7. The kiwi eater doesn't live in house number 1.


Hmm, this is tricky!  Let me see...  

*Since the kiwi eater doesn't live in house 1 and the loafers person does, the kiwi eater must be in house 2 or 3.

*The boots person can't be in house 3, so they must be in house 2.

*If the boots person is in house 2, the gameboy person must be in house 1.

*The kiwi eater lives next to the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in house 3.

*The grape eater lives next to the water drinker, and we know the kiwi eater is in house 2, so the grape eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker in house 2.

*The phone person lives to the left of the mango eater, so the mango eater must be in house 3 and the phone person in house 1.

Okay, I think I got it!

* House 1: Loafers, Gameboy, Grapes, Phone
