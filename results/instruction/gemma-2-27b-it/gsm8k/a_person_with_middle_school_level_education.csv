"Here's how to solve this:

* **Set up a proportion:** We know 75% of the original price is equal to $19.50.  We can write this as a proportion: 75/100 = $19.50 / x (where x is the original price).
* **Solve for x:** To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 75 * x = 100 * $19.50
* **Calculate:** 75x = $1950
* **Isolate x:** Divide both sides by 75: x = $1950 / 75

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.

She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so she has 'x + 30' gold coins.

In total, she has 'x' silver coins + 'x + 30' gold coins = 110 coins.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* Sophia got 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas.
* To find out how far she can go on a full tank (12 gallons), we can set up a proportion: 100 miles / 4 gallons = x miles / 12 gallons

* To solve for x (the number of miles on a full tank), we can cross-multiply: 100 miles * 12 gallons = 4 gallons * x miles

* This gives us 1200 = 4x
* Divide both sides by 4 to find x: 1200 / 4 = 300

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Lylah earned 100% of her salary while Adrien earned 130%.  If Adrien earned $40,000, that represents 130%. To find 100% (Lylah's salary), divide Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

* **Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary increase.**

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is 140% of his old salary. Multiply his old salary by 1.40: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

* **Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary increase.**

Lylah's salary also increased, but we don't know the exact percentage. However, we know it increased at the same rate as Adrien's. So, Lylah's new salary is also 140% of her old salary: $30,769.23 * 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

* **Step 4: Calculate their combined salary.**

* **Rolling two even numbers in a row:** The chance of rolling an even number is 3 out of 6 (2, 4, and 6).  To get two in a row, we multiply the chances together: (3/6) * (3/6) = 9 out of 36, or 25%.

* **The difference:** 50% - 25% = 25%

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Figure out how much money Kenny made from selling cards:** He had $50 for spending money plus the $100 for the ticket, so he made $50 + $100 = $150.

* **Figure out how many cards he sold:** He sold his cards for $1.50 each, so he sold $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.

* **Figure out how many cards he started with:** He kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of them. If 2/3 of his cards equals 100, then 1/3 equals 100 / 2 = 50 cards.

* **Calculate the total number of cards:** Since 1/3 of his cards is 50, he started with 50 x 3 = 150 cards.

* **Venue 2:** Costs $25 per person, and food is included.

We need to find the number of guests where the total cost is the same for both venues.

Let 'x' be the number of guests.

* **Venue 1 cost:** $200 + $5x
* **Venue 2 cost:** $25x

To find when the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we solve for 'x':

1. Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
2. Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    * Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **We know:**
    * B + D + L = 43 (The total number of insects)
    * L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    * D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Now we can use substitution to solve for L (the number of insects Lily found):**

1. **Since D = B/2, we can substitute that into the equation L = D + 7:**
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Now we can substitute both D = B/2 and L = (B/2) + 7 into the equation B + D + L = 43:**
   B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   B + B + 7 = 43

4. **Combine like terms:**
   2B + 7 = 43

5. **Subtract 7 from both sides:**
   2B = 36

6. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   B = 18 (Bodhi found 18 insects)

7. **Now that we know B = 18, we can find D:**
   D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 (David found 9 insects)

8. **Finally, we can find L:**
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)

"Let's break this problem down.

Twice the number of books Sally has is like saying 2 times the number of Sally's books.

Janey has 3 more than that, so we need to subtract 3 from Janey's total books.

21 - 3 = 18

That means twice the number of Sally's books is 18.

To find out how many books Sally has, we divide that number by 2.

18 / 2 = 9

"Let's break this problem down:

* We have 2 twins and 3 triplets, making a total of 5 kids.
* We know one twin is older than one triplet by 7 years.

Let's use some letters to make it easier:

*  Let 't' be the age of one of the twins.
*  Let 'r' be the age of one of the triplets.

We know:

* t = r + 7 (one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)
* 2t + 3r = 44 (the combined ages add up to 44)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 't'.

Since we know t = r + 7, we can put that into the second equation:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Let's solve for 'r':

2r + 14 + 3r = 44
5r + 14 = 44
5r = 30
r = 6

Now that we know 'r' (the age of one triplet is 6), we can find 't' (the age of one twin):

t = r + 7
t = 6 + 7
t = 13

    * S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards)

* **Now we can substitute to solve for P:**
    * Since S = 3P, we can substitute that into the equation B = S + 12:
        * B = (3P) + 12

* **Substitute both S and B into the total cards equation:**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Goats sold from Farm Y:** Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as Farm X, so he sold 10 goats * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

* **Goats left on Farm X:** He started with 55 goats on Farm X and sold 10, leaving 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats.

* **Goats left on Farm Y:** He started with 45 goats on Farm Y and sold 20, leaving 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats.

* **Total goats left:**  Adding the goats left on both farms, we get 45 goats + 25 goats = 70 goats.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use letters:**

   * You = Y
   * Brother = B
   * Sister = S
   * Mom = M

* **Write down what we know:**

   * Y = B - 3  (You are 3 years younger than your brother)
   * Y = S + 2 (You are 2 years older than your sister)
   * M = 3B - 1 (Mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
   * Y + B + S + M = 87 (Adding all the ages equals 87)

* **We need to figure out your age (Y).**  Since we have a few equations, we can use them to solve for Y.

* **Let's substitute:**

   Since we know Y = B - 3, we can put that into the other equations:

   * B - 3 = S + 2 
   * M = 3B - 1

* **Now we have three equations:**

   * B - 3 = S + 2
   * M = 3B - 1
   * Y + B + S + M = 87

* **This problem is a bit tricky to solve without more information.** We need another equation to figure out the exact ages.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use letters to represent the number of books each person has:**
    *  F = Fawn's books
    *  A = Anne's books
    *  S = Sofie's books

* **We know:**
    * F + A + S = 85 (total books)
    * S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
    * A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

* **Now we can substitute to solve for F (Fawn's books):**

1. **Since A = F - 12, we can substitute that into the equation S = A + 25:**
   S = (F - 12) + 25
   S = F + 13

2. **Now we have S = F + 13 and A = F - 12. Let's substitute these into the first equation:**
   F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

3. **Combine like terms:**
   3F + 1 = 85

4. **Subtract 1 from both sides:**
   3F = 84

5. **Divide both sides by 3:**

   * P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * S = 4A - 13  (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount)
    * X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
    * A + S + X = 339 (Together they caught 339 Pokemon)

* **Now we can solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation:
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339

3. **Combine** like terms:

4. **Add** 21 to both sides:
   9A = 360

5. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   A = 40

6. **Now that you know A (Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon), plug it back into the equation S = 4A - 13:**
