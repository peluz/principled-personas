"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We know the following:

*  w = r + 2 (two more white chickens than red chickens)
* 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs collected)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r':

1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
2. **Simplify** the equation: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the Leak:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

* **The Difference:** The fact that the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago and now has four times as much means it lost less water in proportion to the small pool. This is because it started with more water.

* **Setting up the Problem:** Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.  

* **Big Pool Now:** The big pool has four times the water in the small pool now, so it has 4x gallons.

* **Big Pool 4 Minutes Ago:** Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water in the small pool, meaning it had 2x gallons.

* **Water Lost:** In the last 4 minutes, the big pool lost 4x - 2x = 2x gallons.

* **Small Pool Loss:** The small pool also lost 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, a total of 16 gallons.

* **Equation:** Since both pools lose water at the same rate, the big pool must have lost twice as much water as the small pool (because it started with twice as much). This gives us the equation: 2x = 16

* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 8

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many players on offense as defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total:** The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now we can solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3.5x = 105
* Divide both sides by 3.5: x = 30

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know that D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
    * We also know that L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    * Finally, we know that L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

* **Solve for the variables:**

    1.  Since we want to find L (the number of insects Lily found), let's try to express everything in terms of 'B'.
    2. We know D = B/2, so substitute that into the equation L = D + 7:  L = (B/2) + 7
    3. Now substitute both D = B/2 and L = (B/2) + 7 into the equation L + D + B = 43:  ((B/2) + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43
    4. Simplify the equation: (B/2) + (B/2) + B + 7 = 43
    5. Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43
    6. Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36
    7. Divide both sides by 2: B = 18 (Bodhi found 18 insects)
    8. Now that we know B = 18, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9 (David found 9 insects)
    9. Finally, find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)

"Let's break this problem down.

We know:

* **Total cost:** $120,000
* **House cost:** 3 times the cost of the lot

Let's represent the cost of the lot with the variable ""x"".  This means the house cost ""3x"".

The total cost is the sum of the house and lot: x + 3x = $120,000

Combining like terms: 4x = $120,000

To find the cost of the lot (x), divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000

Since the house cost 3 times the lot, the house cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

**Step 1: Small Sticker Trades**

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers: 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers
* She receives 27 small buttons for these stickers.

**Step 2: Large Sticker Trades for Large Buttons**

* **Friends' playtime:** His worse friends play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
* **Better friend's playtime:** His better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.
* **Total playtime in minutes:** They play for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.
* **Quarters needed per friend:**
    * Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent the amount of zest as ""x"".**

* **Fragrance is equal to zest, so she also uses ""x"" ounces of fragrance.**

* **Salt is twice the amount of zest, so she uses ""2x"" ounces of salt.**

* **Sugar is equal to salt, so she also uses ""2x"" ounces of sugar.**

* **Oil is twice the amount of salt, so she uses ""4x"" ounces of oil.**

* **The total amount of ingredients is x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 ounces**

* **Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10 ounces**

* **Dividing both sides by 10, we find that x = 1 ounce.**

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'B' represent Bahati's score.
    *  Let 'A' represent Azibo's score.
    *  Let 'D' represent Dinar's score.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    * B + A + D = 45 (Their total score is 45)

* **Solve for Azibo's score (A):**

    1. Since we want to find 'A', let's express 'B' in terms of 'A' from the first equation: B = A + 20
    2. Substitute this value of 'B' into the second equation: A + 20 = D + 10
    3.  This means D = A + 10
    4. Now substitute both 'B' and 'D' in terms of 'A' into the third equation: (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
    5. Simplify: 3A + 30 = 45
    6. Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa received three times Ronnie's amount, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.
* **Amount given to sister:** Since Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, she gave away 1/5 of her money. This means she gave $15 * (1/5) = $3 to her sister.
* **Ronnie's amount given:**  Rissa and Ronnie gave the same amount to their sister, so Ronnie also gave $3.
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Bills:** Thomas starts with $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills.

2. **Bills Lost:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. **Payment:** He uses half his remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

4. **Bills Remaining:** After the payment, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

5. **Tripling his Money:** Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills worth of money.

6. **Converting to $5 Bills:** Since each bill is now worth $20, he has 60 * $20 = $1200.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let Wendy's current age be 'w' and Colin's current age be 'c'.**

* **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""** translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7)

* **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** translates to the equation: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **From the first equation, we can express 'w' in terms of 'c':** w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:** c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   * c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   * (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   * (3/3)c - (5/3)c = 35/3 - 25
   * (-2/3)c = 10/3
   * c = (10/3) * (-3/2)
   * c = -5

Since age cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for Colin to be -5 years old.
