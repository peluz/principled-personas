"Let's break this problem down using a system of linear equations.

* Let 'w' represent the number of games won.

We know the following:

*  w + l = 22  (The total number of wins and losses equals the total games played)
*  w = l + 8 (They won 8 more games than they lost)

Now we can solve for 'w' (the number of wins):

1. **Substitute** the second equation into the first equation: (l + 8) + l = 22
2. **Combine** like terms: 2l + 8 = 22
3. **Subtract** 8 from both sides: 2l = 14

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of a pepper.**

* **Watermelon cost:** A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, so a watermelon costs 3x.

* **Orange cost:** An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs 3x - 5.

* **Cost of peppers:** Dillon buys 20 peppers at 15$ each, so the peppers cost 20 * 15 = 300$.

* **Cost of watermelons:** Dillon buys 4 watermelons at 3x each, so the watermelons cost 4 * 3x = 12x.

* **Cost of oranges:** Dillon buys 10 oranges at 3x - 5 each, so the oranges cost 10 * (3x - 5) = 30x - 50.

* **Total cost:** The total cost is the sum of the cost of peppers, watermelons, and oranges: 300 + 12x + 30x - 50 = 250 + 42x.

Since each pepper costs $15, we know x = 15.

* **Final Calculation:** Substitute x = 15 into the total cost equation: 250 + 42 * 15 = 250 + 630 = 880.

* Let  'x(t)' represent the amount of water in the small pool at time 't' (in minutes).
* Let 'y(t)' represent the amount of water in the big pool at time 't'.

We know the following:

* **Leak Rate:** Both pools lose water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. This means:
    * dx/dt = -4 
    * dy/dt = -4

* **Initial Conditions:**
    * 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool: y(t-4) = 2x(t-4)
    * Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool: y(t) = 4x(t)

Now we have a system of differential equations:

1. dx/dt = -4
2. dy/dt = -4
3. y(t-4) = 2x(t-4)
4. y(t) = 4x(t)

Solving this system will give us the functions x(t) and y(t), which describe the amount of water in each pool over time.  We can then use these functions to find the current amount of water in the small pool, x(t).

* **Let 'h' represent the number of chickens.**

We know:

* **c + h = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **h = 2c** (There are twice as many chickens as cows)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of cows:

1. **Substitute '2c' for 'h' in the first equation:** c + 2c = 60
2. **Combine like terms:** 3c = 60
3. **Divide both sides by 3:** c = 20

There are 40 chickens.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""x"".

* Twice the son's age is 2x.

* Five years less than twice the son's age is 2x - 5.

* We know this amount equals Carver's age, which is 45.

So, we can set up the equation: 2x - 5 = 45

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's elevation of 10,000 feet: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver's location and the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with.**

* **Cards sold:** Kenny sells 2/3 of his cards (1 - 1/3 = 2/3)

* **Earnings from sales:** He earns 1.5 * (2/3)x = $x  from selling the cards.

* **Total money:** His total money is the earnings from sales plus his initial $50: x + $50

* **Equation:** We know this total equals the cost of the ticket: x + $50 = $100

* **Solve for x:** Subtract $50 from both sides: x = $50

* **Find the total number of cards:** Since x represents the earnings from selling 2/3 of his cards, we can set up another equation: (2/3)x = $50.  Solving for x, we get x = $75.

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.
* Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
* Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* L + D + B = 43  (The total number of insects)
* L = D + 7      (Lily found 7 more than David)
* D = B / 2       (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the variables. 

1. **Substitute** the value of 'D' from the third equation into the second equation:
   L = (B / 2) + 7

2. **Substitute** the values of 'L' and 'D' from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   ((B / 2) + 7) + (B / 2) + B = 43

3. **Simplify** and solve for 'B':
   (B + 14 + B + 2B) / 2 = 43
   (4B + 14) / 2 = 43
   4B + 14 = 86
   4B = 72
   B = 18

4. **Substitute** the value of 'B' back into the equation D = B / 2 to find 'D':
   D = 18 / 2
   D = 9

5. **Substitute** the value of 'D' back into the equation L = D + 7 to find 'L':
   L = 9 + 7
   L = 16

"Here's how to solve this problem using linear programming concepts:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' be the number of 2x4 pieces of wood.
* Let 'y' be the number of 2x8 pieces of wood.

**2. Objective Function:**

* We want to maximize the total number of popsicle sticks: 
   Maximize Z = 200x + 400y

**3. Constraints:**

* **Cost Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The total cost of wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Non-negativity Constraint:** x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (We can't buy negative amounts of wood)

**4. Finding the Optimal Solution:**

To find the optimal solution, we'd typically graph the constraints and find the feasible region. Then, we'd evaluate the objective function at each corner point of the feasible region to determine the maximum value.

**However, in this case, we can use a bit of logic to simplify:**

* Since a 2x8 gives twice the sticks for only $2 more than a 2x4, it's more cost-effective to buy as many 2x8s as possible within the budget.

* With $24, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2x8 wood (4 * $6 = $24).

**5. Calculation:**

* This will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 popsicle sticks.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as  'x'.

* The second angle is twice the smallest: 2x
* The third angle is three times the smallest: 3x

The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

* Let 'o' represent the cost of one orange.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

"Let's break this problem down using a system of linear equations.

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1 (Legs):** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2 (Heads):** s + g = 20

Now we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  => s = 15

* Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
* Let 'y' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
* Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects y + 3 berries.
* Let 't' represent the time Emma has left on the timer.
* Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has t - 4 seconds left.

Now we can set up equations for each player's score:

* **Emma's score:** 10x + 5y + 30t
* **Ava's score:** 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)] - [10x + 5y + 30t]

Simplify the expression:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t

Combine like terms:

-25


The difference between Ava and Emma's scores is **-25**.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations:

* Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
* Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know the following:

*  Bob started with 3 orange fish and bought 'o' more: o + 3 = number of orange fish
* Bob started with 4 white fish and bought 'w' more: w + 4 = number of white fish
* Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish: o + 3 = 2(w + 4)

Now we can solve for 'w':

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third equation: (o + 3) = 2(w + 4)
2. **Simplify** the equation: o + 3 = 2w + 8
3. **Solve for 'o' in terms of 'w':** o = 2w + 5
4. **We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish:** w + o = 17
5. **Substitute** the value of 'o' from step 3 into the equation from step 4: w + (2w + 5) = 17
6. **Simplify and solve for 'w':** 3w + 5 = 17  =>  3w = 12  => w = 4

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

*  Let 'z' represent the ounces of citrus zest.
*  Since she uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, she also uses 'z' ounces of fragrance.
*  She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so let 's' represent the ounces of salt and sugar.
*  She uses twice as much oil as salt, meaning she uses 2*s ounces of oil.

Now, we know the total amount of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Combining like terms:

2z + 4s = 10

We need to find the value of 's' (salt) to determine the amount of oil.  Since we don't have another equation to solve for 'z' and 's' directly, we can use a bit of logic.

We know the amount of salt ('s') plus the amount of sugar ('s') must be more than half the total jar size (since they make up two of the five ingredients).  

Therefore, 2s > 5 ounces. This means 's' must be greater than 2.5 ounces.

Let's try 's' = 3 ounces:

2z + 4(3) = 10
2z + 12 = 10
2z = -2
z = -1

This doesn't make sense, as we can't have negative ounces of zest. Let's try 's' = 2 ounces:

2z + 4(2) = 10
2z + 8 = 10
2z = 2
z = 1

This works! Now we know:

* z = 1 ounce (zest and fragrance)
* s = 2 ounces (salt and sugar)

Finally, the oil is twice the amount of salt:

2 * 2 = 4 ounces

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Anthony's savings:** Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, who has $20.00. So Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

2. **Roy's extra savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, who saved $30.00.  40% of $30.00 is (40/100) * $30.00 = $12.00.

3. **Roy's total savings:** Roy saved $12.00 more than Anthony's $30.00, so Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift it 12 times higher than Pompei. So Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  Therefore, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

* **Conversion to feet:** There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

* **Find the time one kangaroo takes:** If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours.

* **Find the speed of one kangaroo:**  We don't have a distance, so we can think of speed as ""distance per unit of time"". Since we're comparing times, the actual distance doesn't matter.

* **Find the speed of one turtle:** A turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so it takes twice as long.

* **Find the time for four turtles:** Since each turtle takes twice as long as a kangaroo, four turtles will take 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

*  Let 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has.
*  Let 'A' represent the number of books Anne has.

We are given the following information:

* S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
* S = A + 25     (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12     (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:

* A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
* A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount)

Now we can use substitution to solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan has caught):

1. **Substitute** the value of 'A' from the second equation into the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + W = 334

3. **Substitute** the value of 'S' from the third equation into the simplified equation:
   2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. **Simplify** and solve for 'W':
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. **Substitute** the value of 'W' back into the equation for 'S':
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

* **She sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **Large stuffed animals cost three times as much as small ones, meaning they cost 3 * $4 = $12 each.**

* **Earnings from small stuffed animals:** 4 * 2x = 8x
* **Total earnings:** 12x + 8x = $120

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold (and Madeline) painted.**

* **Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.**

* **Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.**

* **Together, Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 30**

Now we can solve for 'y':

* **2y + 12 = 30**
* **2y = 18**
* **y = 9**

So Sarah painted 9 eggs.

* **Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.**

* **Arnold painted 'x' eggs, and we know the total number of eggs painted is 56: 2x + 21 + 9 = 56**

Now we can solve for 'x':

* **2x + 30 = 56**
* **2x = 26**
* **x = 13**

Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, to find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:

* **Mug 2:** This is the unknown temperature we need to find.
* **Mixing:** He mixes 4 ounces from Mug 1 and 1 ounce from Mug 2.

Since the final mixture is drinkable (at least 40 degrees), the contribution from Mug 2 must raise the overall temperature.

Let 'x' be the temperature of the second mug.  We can set up a weighted average to represent the final temperature:

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of individual sunflowers sold.**
* **Let 'y' represent the number of bouquets sold.**

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1 (Earnings from sunflowers):** 2x + 8y = 26 * 3 = 78  (He earns $26 per day from sunflowers for 3 days)
* **Equation 2 (Earnings from bouquets):** 8y = 56 * 3 = 168 (He earns $56 per day from bouquets for 3 days)

Now we can solve for 'y' in Equation 2:

* 8y = 168
* y = 21

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, Faraday sold 21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers in bouquets.

Now, let's substitute the value of 'y' back into Equation 1 to find 'x':

* 2x + 8(21) = 78
* 2x + 168 = 78
* 2x = -90
* x = -45

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It's impossible to sell a negative number of sunflowers. This indicates there might be an error in the given information.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the initial number of bills:** Thomas withdraws $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills.

2. **Calculate the number of bills after losing some:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. **Calculate the number of bills used for the payment:** He uses half of his remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

4. **Calculate the number of bills remaining after the payment:** He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

5. **Calculate the amount of money after tripling:** He triples his money, so he now has 20 bills * $20/bill * 3 = $1200.

6. **Calculate the number of 5 dollar bills:** He converts his money to 5 dollar bills, resulting in $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 bills.

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let Wendy's current age be 'w'
* Let Colin's current age be 'c'

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** w = 5(c + 7)  (Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years)
* **Equation 2:** c + 25 = (1/3)w  (In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now)

Now we can solve for 'c' (Colin's current age).

One way to solve this system is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':** 
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   (3/3)c + 75/3 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = 20

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this problem down.

* Regina wrote 9 novels, which represents 3/4 of her total novels this year.

* To find the total number of novels, we need to figure out what number 9 is 3/4 of.

* We can set up a proportion: (3/4) * Total Novels = 9

* To solve for the Total Novels, we can divide both sides of the equation by (3/4):

Total Novels = 9 / (3/4)

* Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its inverse:

Total Novels = 9 * (4/3)

* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, so there are 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

"Here's how to break down the cost:

* **T-shirts:**
    * One T-shirt costs $8.
    * The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.50 = $4.
    * The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

* **Shoes:**
    * The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.
    * The sale price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

* **Total Cost:**
    * The total cost is the price of the T-shirts plus the price of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations:

* Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually brought.
* Let 'b' represent the number of beakers Igor brought to the bench.
* Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor actually brought.

We know the following:

*  t = 16 / 2 = 8 (Igor brought half the requested test tubes)
*  p = 14 + 2 = 16 (Igor brought two more Petri dishes than requested)
*  t + b + p = 29 (The total number of items on the bench)

Substituting the values we know:

* 8 + b + 16 = 29

Combining like terms:

* b + 24 = 29

Solving for 'b':

* b = 29 - 24
* b = 5

Igor lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent Vanessa's speed.
    * Aaron's speed is then '2x' (twice as fast).

* **Distance and Time:**
    * We know Vanessa ran 4 miles.
    * Let 't' represent the time Vanessa took.

* **Setting up the equations:**
    *  Vanessa's time:  time = distance / speed  =>  t = 4 / x
    * Aaron's time: time = distance / speed => 16 = distance / 2x

* **Finding Aaron's distance:**
    * From Aaron's time equation, we can find his distance: distance = 16 * 2x = 32x

* **Relating distances:**
    * We know Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron: 4 = 2 * (32x)

* **Solving for x (Vanessa's speed):**
    * 4 = 64x
    * x = 4 / 64 = 1/16 miles per minute

* **Finding Vanessa's time:**
    * t = 4 / (1/16) = 64 minutes

"Let's set up a system of equations to solve this problem:

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1 (total animals):** c + w = 20
* **Equation 2 (total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens).  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':**  w = 20 - c
2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  => c = 5
