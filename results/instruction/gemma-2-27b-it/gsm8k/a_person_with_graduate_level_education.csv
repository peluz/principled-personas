"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'w' represent the number of games won.**
* **Let 'l' represent the number of games lost.**

We know the following:

* **w + l = 22** (The total number of wins and losses equals the total games played)
* **w = l + 8** (They won 8 more games than they lost)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w':

1. **Substitute 'l + 8' for 'w' in the first equation:** (l + 8) + l = 22
2. **Combine like terms:** 2l + 8 = 22
3. **Subtract 8 from both sides:** 2l = 14
4. **Divide both sides by 2:** l = 7

* **Adrien's salary increase:** Adrien's salary increased by 40%, meaning his salary four years later is $40000 * 1.40 = $56000.
* **Lylah's salary increase:** We need to find Lylah's salary increase. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by a certain percentage. Let's assume Lylah's salary increased by 'x' percent. This means her salary four years later is $30769.23 * (1 + x/100).
* **Finding Lylah's salary increase:** We know Adrien's salary four years later is $56000, which is 40% more than his salary four years ago.  We can set up a proportion to find Lylah's salary increase:

(Adrien's salary increase) / (Adrien's salary four years ago) = (Lylah's salary increase) / (Lylah's salary four years ago)

($56000 - $40000) / $40000 = (Lylah's salary four years later - $30769.23) / $30769.23

Solving for Lylah's salary four years later, we get:

Lylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 * 1.40 = $43076.92

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

2. **After the seagull:**  There were 14 fries (Dave's) + 7 fries (seagull's) = 21 fries left.

3. **Pigeons' share:** The three pigeons ate a total of 3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon = 9 fries.

4. **After the pigeons:** There were 21 fries - 9 fries = 12 fries left.

5. **Raccoon's share:** The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 12 fries = 8 fries.

6. **After the raccoon:** There were 12 fries - 8 fries = 4 fries left.

7. **Before the ants:** Since 1 fry was left after the ants took one, there were 4 fries + 1 fry = 5 fries before the ants.

8. **Original amount:**  Therefore, Dave originally had 5 fries + 8 fries (raccoon's share) + 9 fries (pigeons' share) + 7 fries (seagull's share) + 14 fries (Dave's share) = 43 fries.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Noah's age six years ago:** Since Cera is currently 46, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. Noah was half her age then, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

2. **Noah's current age:** Noah is currently 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

3. **Chile's population six years ago:** The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

4. **Chile's current population:** Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many players on offense as defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as defense, meaning there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Total:** The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Now we can solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3.5x = 105
* Divide both sides by 3.5: x = 30

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    *  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    *  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know L + D + B = 43 (total insects)
    *  We know L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    *  We know D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Solve for the variables:**

    1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation: (D + 7) + D + (2 * D) = 43

    2. **Simplify** the equation: 4D + 7 = 43

    3. **Subtract** 7 from both sides: 4D = 36

    4. **Divide** both sides by 4: D = 9 (David found 9 insects)

    5. **Substitute** the value of D back into the equation L = D + 7: L = 9 + 7

    6. **Calculate** L: L = 16 (Lily found 16 insects)

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the following:

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. Solve equation 2 for 'g':  g = 20 - s
2. Substitute this value of 'g' into equation 1: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) used.**
* **Salt and sugar are equal, so they each also equal 'x'.**
* **Oil is twice the amount of salt, so it equals 2 * x = 2x.**

The total amount of ingredients is x + x + x + 2x + 2x = 7x.

We know this equals 10 ounces, so 7x = 10 ounces.

Solving for x: x = 10 ounces / 7 = 1.43 ounces (approximately).

Since oil is 2x, the amount of oil used is 2 * 1.43 ounces = 2.86 ounces.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
    *  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)

* **Solve for the length of the red rope (r):**

1. **Substitute** the second equation (b = y - 7) into the first equation:
   r = 4(y - 7)

2. **Substitute** both the first equation (r = 4(y - 7)) and the second equation (b = y - 7) into the third equation:

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

Here's what we know from the problem:

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7)
* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. w = 5c + 35
2. c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for 'c' (Colin's current age):

1. **Substitute** the value of 'w' from equation 1 into equation 2:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

2. **Simplify** and solve for 'c':
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = (40/3) * (3/2)
   c = 20


Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Regina wrote 9 novels, which represents 3/4 of her total novels written this year.
* To find the total number of novels written this year, we need to figure out what number 9 represents 3/4 of.

We can set up a proportion:

(3/4) * Total Novels = 9

To solve for the Total Novels, we can divide both sides of the equation by (3/4):

Total Novels = 9 / (3/4)

Total Novels = 9 * (4/3)

Total Novels = 12

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's figure out Aaron's speed:** Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron effectively runs 4 miles * 2 = 8 miles.
* **Calculate Aaron's pace:** Aaron ran 8 miles in 16 minutes, so his pace is 16 minutes / 8 miles = 2 minutes per mile.
* **Determine Vanessa's pace:** Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, meaning she runs 8 miles * 2 = 16 miles. Since Aaron runs twice as fast, Vanessa's pace is 2 minutes/mile * 2 = 4 minutes per mile.
* **Calculate Vanessa's time:** Vanessa runs 4 miles at a pace of 4 minutes per mile, so her total time is 4 miles * 4 minutes/mile = 16 minutes.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens) using substitution or elimination. Here's the solution using substitution:

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5


Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
