* Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.

* **Let 'l' represent the number of games lost.**

We know:

*  w + l = 22 (total games played)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

Combine like terms:

* 2l + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

* 2l = 14

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Trees planted:** Over 10 years, Tom plants 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.

2. **Trees chopped down:** Over 10 years, he chops down 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.

3. **Net increase from planting and chopping:** Tom has a net increase of 100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees.

4. **Total trees after 10 years:** He started with 50 trees and added 80, for a total of 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries).

One way to solve is using substitution:

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:** 2(180 - d) + d = 304

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Oven Heating:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, and it's on for 3 hours, so the temperature increases by 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

2. **Temperature After Baking:** The initial temperature was 40 degrees, and it increased by 15 degrees, so the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. **Window Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The temperature drops 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it drops 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

4. **Final Temperature:** The temperature after baking was 55 degrees, and it dropped by 6 degrees, resulting in a final temperature of 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution or elimination. Here's the solution using elimination:

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.**

* **Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.**

* **Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.**

* **The total number of cards is 341, so x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341**

Now we can solve for x:

* **7x + 12 = 341**
* **7x = 329**
* **x = 47**

PJ has 47 cards.

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**

"Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Distance swam:** James swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.
* **Time swimming the first part:** At 2 miles per hour, this takes him 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.
* **Rest time:** He rests for half the swimming time, so 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.
* **Distance remaining:** He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.
* **Speed for the remaining distance:** He swims at half his original speed, so 2 mph / 2 = 1 mph.
* **Time swimming the last part:** This takes him 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

* **Consider the impact of the colder water:** The 33-degree water will cool down the mixture.

Let's assume the water bottle is large enough that the 4 ounces of 33-degree water don't significantly change the overall temperature.  In this case, the second bottle would need to be at least 40 degrees to ensure the final mixture is drinkable.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

Here's what we know from the problem:

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7)
* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. w = 5c + 35
2. c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for 'c' (Colin's current age):

1. **Substitute** the value of 'w' from equation 1 into equation 2:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

2. **Simplify** and solve for 'c':
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = (40/3) * (3/2)
   c = 20

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered 16 test tubes / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 14 Petri dishes + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total intended items:** 16 test tubes + 7 beakers + 14 Petri dishes = 37 items.
* **Items lost:** 37 items - 29 items = 8 items.

Therefore, Igor lost **8** beakers.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's figure out Aaron's speed:** Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron effectively runs 4 miles * 2 = 8 miles.
* **Calculate Aaron's pace:** Aaron ran 8 miles in 16 minutes, so his pace is 16 minutes / 8 miles = 2 minutes per mile.
* **Determine Vanessa's pace:** Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, meaning she runs 8 miles * 2 = 16 miles. Since Aaron runs twice as fast, Vanessa's pace is 2 minutes/mile * 2 = 4 minutes per mile.
* **Calculate Vanessa's time:** Vanessa runs 4 miles at a pace of 4 minutes per mile, so her total time is 4 miles * 4 minutes/mile = 16 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit = (Profit Percentage / 100) * Cost Price
* Profit = (25 / 100) * $80 = $20

**2. Calculate the total selling price:**

* Total Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
* Total Selling Price = $80 + $20 = $100

**3. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**

* Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
* Selling Price per Watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

3. **John's current age:** John was 19 when James was born, so he is currently 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

4. **Youngest son's current age:** John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

5. **Youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

* **Calculate oranges peeled per minute:**
    * Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes.
    * Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes.

* **Calculate oranges peeled per hour:**
    * Ana peels 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges per hour.
    * Jane peels 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges per hour.

* **Find the difference:**
    * Ana peels 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Here's how to solve this classic word problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.**

* **We know:**
    * c + w = 20 (total number of animals)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (total number of legs)

* **Solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for 'c' in the first equation:**
    * c = 20 - w

* **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
    * 2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

* **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
    * 40 - 2w + 4w = 70
    * 2w = 30
    * w = 15

* **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':**
    * c = 20 - 15
    * c = 5
