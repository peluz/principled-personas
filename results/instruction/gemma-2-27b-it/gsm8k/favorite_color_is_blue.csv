* **Let 'x' be the original number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.**

* **Green house:** Melanie sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

* **Remaining after green house:** Melanie had x - (x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

* **Red house:** She sold 2 more, leaving her with (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners.

* **Orange house:** She sold half of the remaining amount, which is [(2x/3) - 2]/2 = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners.

* **Final amount:** After selling to the orange house, she has 5 left: [(2x/3) - 2] - [(x/3) - 1] = 5

* **Simplify:** (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

* **Combine terms:** (x/3) - 1 = 5

Let 'w' represent the number of games won and 'l' represent the number of games lost.

We know:

* w + l = 22 (total games played)
* w = l + 8 (they won 8 more than they lost)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combine like terms:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2l = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 7

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won:

w = l + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understand the Leak:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

* **The Difference:** The big pool lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). The small pool also lost 16 gallons.

* **Ratio Change:**  Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, and now has four times as much, the big pool lost a larger proportion of its water. This means the small pool must have started with less water.

* **Let's use variables:**

    * Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool now.
    * The big pool had 2x water 4 minutes ago, and now has 4x water.

* **Set up an equation:** The big pool lost 3x gallons in the last 4 minutes (2x - x = x, and x * 3 = 3x).

* **Solve for x:** Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, we know 3x = 16.  Therefore, x = 16/3 = 5.33 gallons (approximately).

* **Calculate the total number of sections:** The redwood is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet long, so there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.
* **Calculate the original weight:**  Each section weighs 400 pounds, and there are 20 sections, so the redwood originally weighed 400 * 20 = 8000 pounds.
* **Calculate the weight lost:** Termites ate 30% of the wood, so the redwood lost 8000 * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.
* **Calculate the current weight:** The redwood originally weighed 8000 pounds and lost 2400 pounds, so it now weighs 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The ratio 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

**2. Find the Unit Value:**

The ratio represents a total of 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

**3. Calculate the Value of One Part:**

Divide the total number of popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

**4. Determine the Number of Popsicles Each Person Has:**

* Betty: 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles
* Sam: 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    *  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    *  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  D = B / 2  (David found half of what Bodhi found)
    *  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    *  L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

* **Solve for the variables:**

    1.  Since we want to find 'L' (the number of insects Lily found), let's try to express everything in terms of 'B'.
    2. We know D = B / 2, so substitute that into the third equation: L + (B / 2) + B = 43
    3. Simplify: L + (3B / 2) = 43
    4. Now, substitute L = D + 7: (B / 2) + 7 + (3B / 2) = 43
    5. Combine like terms: 2B + 14 = 43
    6. Subtract 14 from both sides: 2B = 29
    7. Divide both sides by 2: B = 14.5 
    8. Now that you know B, you can find D: D = B / 2 = 14.5 / 2 = 7.25
    9. Finally, find L: L = D + 7 = 7.25 + 7 = 14.25

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the following:

* Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs.
* Each sheep and each goose has 1 head.

This gives us two equations:

1. **4s + 2g = 70** (total legs)
2. **s + g = 20** (total heads)

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. Solve equation 2 for 'g':  g = 20 - s
2. Substitute this value of 'g' into equation 1: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * p + pa + j = 100  (The combined age is 100)
    * pa = j + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
    * p = pa + j (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Total Loss:**

   * The total percentage lost is 45% + 21% = 66%

* **Charge Remaining Before Losses:**

   * If 28% is the remaining charge after a 66% loss, the original charge was 28% / (100% - 66%) = 28% / 34% = 0.82 (or 82%)
