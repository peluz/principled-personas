"Let's see... she gets 16 eggs, eats 3, and uses 4 for muffins. That's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs gone.

So she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

"
"Okay, so it takes 2 bolts of blue and half of that is 1 bolt of white.

2 + 1 = 3

"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 fixin' it up. That's a total of $130,000 he put into it.

Now, the repairs made the house worth 150% more.  That means it's worth 150/100 times more, or 1.5 times more than before.

So, we gotta figure out what 1.5 times the original value is.  That's $80,000 times 1.5, which is $120,000.

Now, add that to the $50,000 he spent on repairs, and the house is worth $170,000.

To find his profit, we subtract what he spent from what it's worth now: $170,000 - $130,000 = $40,000

$40,000 

"
"Okay, so he runs 3 sprints times 60 meters each, that's 180 meters each time he runs.

Then he does that 3 times a week, so 180 times 3 is...

540 

"
"Let's see... Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the mornin' and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups already.

Each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she's got 20 chickens, so that's 3 x 20 = 60 cups total.

So she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 more cups at night. 


20
"
"Okay, so every other glass is cheaper.  That means half of the glasses are $5 and half are 60% of $5.

60% of $5 is $3.

So, 8 glasses cost $5 each, which is 8 * $5 = $40.

The other 8 glasses cost $3 each, which is 8 * $3 = $24.

In total, Kylar needs to pay $40 + $24 = $64.

$64 

"
"Okay, so Charleston has 4 times the sheep Seattle has, so that's 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so that's 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

260 

"
"Okay, so Carla downloads 2 GB every minute.  That means she downloads 80 GB in 40 minutes.

Then the computer restarts and she has to start over.

So she downloads 200 GB, but she already did 80 GB, so that's 120 GB left.

120 GB divided by 2 GB per minute is 60 minutes.

So it takes 40 minutes plus 20 minutes plus 60 minutes.

That's 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, that's 3 times 60 which is 180 miles.

Then he's stuck for 2 hours, so he don't go nowhere.

Then he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, so that's half an hour times 30, which is 15 miles.

He's got 1.5 hours left, and he's going 80 mph, so that's 1.5 times 80 which is 120 miles.

So, he drives 180 miles, then 0 miles, then 15 miles, then 120 miles.

That's 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

But he's driving back home, so he's 315 miles away from home.

315 

"
"Okay, so Eliza gets $10 an hour for her regular work. That's 40 hours times $10, which is $400.

Then she worked 5 extra hours, so that's 5 times $10 times 1.2, which is $60.

So her total earnings are $400 plus $60.


460 

"
"Okay, so the second month had way more downloads, three times more than the first month. That's 60 times 3, which is 180 downloads.

Then the third month was less than the second month, 30% less.  

Hmm, 30% of 180 is... lemme see... that's like 180 divided by 10, which is 18, and then times 3, so 54 less downloads.

So the third month had 180 minus 54, which is 126 downloads.

Now to find the total, we add up all the downloads: 60 plus 180 plus 126.

60 + 180 + 126 = 366


366
"
"Okay, so Toula bought a lot of sweets!

Let's see... donuts cost $68 a dozen and she got 3 dozen, so that's 68 times 3, which is 204 dollars.

Cupcakes were 80 dollars a dozen and she got 2 dozen, so that's 80 times 2, which is 160 dollars.

Cheesecakes were 55 dollars a dozen and she got 6 dozen, so that's 55 times 6, which is 330 dollars.

Now we gotta add all that up: 204 plus 160 plus 330...

204 + 160 + 330 = 694


694
"
"Okay, so the tree costs $90.  He makes $1.50 for each lemon and gets 7 lemons a year. That's $1.50 times 7, which is $10.50 a year. But he spends $3 a year to take care of it. So he makes $10.50 minus $3, which is $7.50 a year.

He needs to make $90 to cover the cost of the tree. So we gotta see how many times $7.50 goes into $90.

That's $90 divided by $7.50...

12



"
"Let's see... she sold some at the green house, then a couple more, then half of the rest.  That means she musta had a whole bunch to start with.

If she has 5 left, and that's half, then she had 10 before the orange house.

Add the 2 she sold to the red house, that's 12.

And if 12 is what she had after the green house, and that's a third, then she started with 36!


36 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the students like contemporary, that's 20 times 0.20 which is 4 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then 25% of them like jazz, so that's 16 times 0.25 which is 4 students.

So 16 - 4 = 12 students like hip-hop.

That's 12 out of 20 students, so 12 divided by 20 times 100% is... 60%


60
"
"Well, lemme see here...

Jewelry goes up by 2.5%, so that's 5000 times 0.025, which is 125 bucks more.

Gadgets go up by 1.2%, so that's 8000 times 0.012, which is 96 bucks more.

125 is more than 96.

125 



"
"Well, they went 80 miles one way and then 150 miles the other way.

230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes money two ways. Teachin' and coachin'.

Teachin' pays good, $20 an hour, and she does that a lot, 35 hours every week.

Coachin' is even better, $30 an hour, and she does that for 15 hours a week.

She works all year round, 50 weeks, so we gotta multiply all that out.

Let's see... 35 hours teachin' times $20 is $700 a week.

And 15 hours coachin' times $30 is $450 a week.

So teachin' and coachin' together is $700 + $450, which is $1150 a week.

Now we gotta multiply that by the 50 weeks she works.

$1150 times 50 is... $57,500.

$57,500 

"
"Let's see... she uses 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 times 7 days, which is 21 eggs a week.

Then we gotta do 21 times 4 weeks, which is 84 eggs.

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, so we divide 84 by 12.

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to walk 12 miles total. She already walked 6 miles, so she has 6 more miles to go.

She wants to average 4 miles per hour, and she's already been walking for 2 hours.

To figure out how fast she needs to go, we gotta think about how much time she has left.

If she wants to average 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, that means she wants to finish in 3 hours total.

She's already walked for 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left.

She needs to walk 6 miles in 1 hour.

So she needs to walk at 6 miles per hour.


6
"
"Okay, so I got 10 liters of orange drink, but it's mostly water, right? Two-thirds water means... hmm... that's like, 6 and a half liters of water in the orange drink.

Then I got 15 liters of pineapple drink, and that's three-fifths water.  So that's... let's see... 9 liters of water in the pineapple.

Now, I spill some orange drink, one whole liter.  So now I got 9 liters of orange drink left, and that's still got the same amount of water, 6 and a half liters.

So, all together, I got 6 and a half liters of water from the orange and 9 liters from the pineapple.

That's 15 and a half liters of water in 24 liters of drink.

"
"Let's see... Raymond is older than Samantha by 6 years. So if Samantha is 31, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37.

Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

"
"Let's see... 3 customers bought one DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs. Then 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 4 more DVDs.

3 + 4 = 7

"
"Well, lemme see... it burns for four hours, right?  'Cause it's from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock.

And it gets shorter by 2 centimeters every hour.

So, it'll be 2 times 4 centimeters shorter.

8 

"
"Well, if it was 25% off, that means he saved 25 cents out of every dollar.  

So, if he saved $4.875, the book was originally $24.375.

24.375 

"
"Let's see... chicken is $12, and milk is $3 each, so 5 milks cost $15. Apples are $1.50 each, so 4 apples cost $6.  That's $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

So the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.

Each pizza is $8.50, so Marie bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 pizzas.


2 

"
"Let's see... 3 shorts times $16.50 is $49.50.

3 pants times $22.50 is $67.50.

3 shoes times $42 is $126.

Now we add it all up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243


243 

"
"Well, she eats one a night, so in 60 days that's 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.

If each carton costs $4.00, then 4 cartons will cost 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.


$16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry went 20 miles, then stopped.  He stopped again 15 miles before the end, which is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

That means he went 45 - 20 = 25 miles between stops.

25 

"
"Let's see... them fancy heels cost twice as much as the other ones, so that's 33 times 2, which is 66 dollars.

Together they cost 33 plus 66, which is 99 dollars.

The boots cost 5 dollars more than that, so they are 99 plus 5, which is 104 dollars.

104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages add up to 162, and their ages are like parts of a pie, with Darrell's part being 7 and Allen's being 11. That means there are 18 parts in total (7 + 11 = 18).

To find out how old one part is, we divide their total age by the number of parts: 162 / 18 = 9.

So, Allen is 11 parts, which is 11 * 9 = 99 years old now.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

109 

"
"Okay, so the first friend says 80.

The second friend says 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend says 25% more than 80. That's like a quarter of 80, which is 20. So 80 plus 20 is 100.

Now we gotta find the average. Add all the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Then divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

"Well, if he spends half an hour on each dog, and he's got 10 dogs, that's 5 hours a day.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If Gretchen has more gold coins than silver ones, and there's 30 extra gold ones...

Let's say she has ""x"" silver coins.

That means she has ""x + 30"" gold coins.

All together, that's x + (x + 30) = 110 coins.

So, 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

That means she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.


70 

"
"Okay, so Raymond has 40 jewels.

Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

23
"
"Okay, so Mike scored more points in the second half.  

25% of 4 points is 1 point (cause 25% is a quarter, and a quarter of 4 is 1).

So he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second half.

That means he scored a total of 4 + 5 = 9 points.

9 

"
"Well, lemme see... Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they come in packs of 4. So he needs to buy 2 packs a day, right?

That's 2 packs a day times 30 days, which is 60 packs.

Now, each pack costs $5.00, so 60 packs times $5.00 is...

$300.00 

"
"John sold all his lego sets, so he has zero left.

0 

"
"Well, lemme see... he runs 3 hours the first day, and half of that is 1.5 hours.

So he runs 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours a week.

That means he runs 60 miles in 6 hours.

60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

10 

"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs. So she runs at 3 times 2, which is 6 miles per hour.

She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 6 divided by 4, which is 1.5 miles per hour.

She runs for one-third of six hours, which is 2 hours. She walks for two-thirds of six hours, which is 4 hours.

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 2 times 6, which is 12 miles.

In those 4 hours of walking, she covers 4 times 1.5, which is 6 miles.

So in total, she travels 12 plus 6, which is 18 miles.

"
"Okay, so Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, which is 1 year old. That means Ben's phone is 2 years old.

Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 4 times 2 years old.

"Okay, so you got 2000 calories for the day, and you already ate 1800. That leaves you with 200.

Each serving of chips is 250 calories, so that's too much.

The bag has 5 servings, so each serving is 300 grams divided by 5, which is 60 grams.

You can only eat a little bit of chips today.


60 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of stuff that costs $10.00.  He sells them for $2.00 each.  So if he makes 20 candles, that's two pounds of stuff.

That means it costs him $20.00 for the stuff.

He makes $40.00 selling 20 candles.

$40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00


$20.00
"
"Okay, so Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more than Monday, so that's 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles.

That means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Now, each article takes 4 hours, so she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

104 

"
"Let's see... Candice started with 80 and used 220, so that's 80 + 220 = 300.  She had 23 left over, so she musta bought 300 - 23 = 277 more.

277 

"
"Okay, so John bought some blue ties and red ties.  The blue ties cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them.  That means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

He bought twice as many red ties, so he got 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so they cost 40 * 1.50 = $60 each.

He spent 10 * 60 = $600 on red ties.

In total, he spent 600 + 200 = $800 on ties.

800 

"
"Well, there are 12 inches in a foot, so the wire was 4 times 12, or 48 inches long.  She cut the wire into pieces that were 6 inches long, so she got 48 divided by 6 pieces.

8 

"
"Okay, so there's 15 floors times 8 units per floor, that's 120 units total.

If 3 out of 4 are full, that means 1 out of 4 is empty.

So, 120 units divided by 4 is 30 units.

"
"Okay, so Lloyd gets 252 eggs every day.  That's a lot of eggs!  A dozen has 12 eggs, so he has 252 divided by 12, which is 21 dozen eggs.

He sells each dozen for $2, so he makes 21 times 2 dollars, which is 42 dollars a day.

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so he makes 42 times 7, which is 294 dollars a week.


294 

"
"Well, let's see. He sails for 3 hours goin' out. That's 10 miles an hour times 3 hours, so he goes 30 miles out.

"
"Let's see... 30 comic books times 1/4 pound each is 7.5 pounds.

That means he needs to take out 7.5 more pounds of toys.

If each toy is 1/2 pound, he needs to take out 15 toys.

15 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

Truck tires are $60 each, and he did 6 of them on Thursday. That's 6 times 60, which is 360 bucks.

Car tires are $40 each, and he did 4 on Thursday. That's 4 times 40, which is 160 bucks.

So on Thursday, he made 360 plus 160, which is 520 bucks.

On Friday, he did 12 car tires, so that's 12 times 40, which is 480 bucks.

Thursday was better, so let's see how much better... 520 minus 480 is 40 bucks.

"
"Let's see... Patchy had three times the number of kittens as the 7 they brought home, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21 kittens.

"
"Okay, so the truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds.  The bridge can hold 5000 pounds. That means there's 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds left for boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we can fit 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes on the truck.


83 

"
"Okay, so first you gotta figure out how much the fee was.  25% of 40 bucks is 10 bucks.  Then you add the delivery and the tip.

10 + 3 + 4 = 17

So the extra stuff cost 17 dollars.

40 + 17 = 57

"Let's see... 20% of 25 oranges is 5 unripe oranges.

That means there are 25 - 5 = 20 oranges that are either good or sour.

We know 2 are sour, so 20 - 2 = 18 oranges must be good.

18 

"
"Okay, so she spent $500 plus $800, that's $1300.  Then she paid 10% more, so that's... hmm... 10% of 1300 is...

So she paid 130 more dollars.

1300 + 130 = 1430


1430
"
"Well, she worked for 30 years, so that's 10 years more than when she starts gettin' that extra 5%.  

So, that extra bit is 50,000 times 0.05, which is 2,500 dollars.

She gets that extra 2,500 every year for 10 years, so that's 2,500 times 10, which is 25,000 dollars.

So, her pension is 50,000 plus 25,000.

25,000 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month. That's like, a lot of money for watchin' shows!

Half a year is six months, right? So for the first six months, she pays 6 times $140, which is $840.

Then they give her a discount, 10% off, so that's $140 times 0.10, which is $14 less each month.

So for the last six months, she pays $140 - $14 = $126 each month.

That means for the last six months, she pays $126 times 6, which is $756.

Now we add up the two parts: $840 + $756 = $1596.


1596 

"
"Well, she got 100 miles outta 4 gallons.  So if she had a full tank, that's 12 gallons, she could probably go 3 times as far.

"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for half that time, so that's 2 / 2 = 1 hour of reading.

That's 2 + 1 = 3 hours total each time he does this.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours a week.

Over 4 weeks, that's 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"
"Let's see...

Each school has 5 girls and 5 boys, that's 10 players.

And they got two coaches, one for each team.

So that's 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.

There are 4 schools, so 12 people per school times 4 schools is... 48 people.

48 

"
"Okay, so there's diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

Let's see... 175 diamonds minus 35 is 140 rubies.

Then there's twice the rubies in emeralds, so that's 140 times 2, which is 280 emeralds.

Now we add 'em all up: 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds.

That's a whole lotta gems!

595 

"
"Well, if there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 60 girls times 2, which is 120 boys.

That's a lot of kids!  So there are 120 boys plus 60 girls, for a total of 180 kids.

Now, if there are 5 kids for every teacher, we gotta divide the total kids by 5.

180 divided by 5 is 36.


36 

"
"Well, she gets $5 every week for 8 weeks, so that's 5 times 8, which is 40 dollars.

If she has $100 now, and that's $40 from her allowance, then she musta started with 100 minus 40.


60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lot of dancin'!

Let's see... 5 classes a day times 5 weekdays is 25 classes.

Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday, so that's 25 + 8 = 33 classes total.

Each class has 15 kids, so that's 33 times 15, which is 495 kids.

And she makes $15 from each kid, so 495 times 15 is... hmm... carry the one... 7425!

7425 



"
"Let's see... the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

To find the total, we add the instructions from both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for 3 dollars each and he sold 43 of them. That's 3 times 43... which is 129 dollars.

Then he sells cheesecake for 4 dollars a slice and he sold 23 slices. So that's 4 times 23... which is 92 dollars.

Now we gotta add those together. 129 plus 92 is... 221 dollars.

"Okay, so Shiela buys five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 times 150... which is 750 dollars.

Then there's interest, 2% of each phone... so that's 150 times 0.02... which is 3 dollars interest per phone.

Five phones times 3 dollars interest is 15 dollars total interest.

So, 750 plus 15 is 765 dollars total.

Now, she pays this over 3 months, so 765 divided by 3 is... 255 dollars per month.


255 

"
"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for almost three dollars, petunias for almost two dollars, and begonias for a little over two dollars.

He rounds everything to the nearest dollar, so marigolds are 3 dollars, petunias are 2 dollars, and begonias are 2 dollars.

He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 times 3 dollars, which is 36 dollars.

He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 times 2 dollars, which is 18 dollars.

He sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 times 2 dollars, which is 34 dollars.

Now we add up all the money: 36 dollars + 18 dollars + 34 dollars.

36 + 18 + 34 = 88


88
"
"Well, if the top level is 16, and each level is half the size of the one below it, then the level below that would be 16 times 2, which is 32.

The level below that would be 32 times 2, which is 64.

And the bottom level would be 64 times 2, which is 128.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240

Then we divide that by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60


60 

"
"Okay, so the puppy eats 1 cup a day for 180 days. That's 180 cups of food.

Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so that's 365 - 180 = 185 days left.

That's 185 days times 2 cups a day, which is 370 cups.

So in total, the puppy eats 180 + 370 = 550 cups in a year.

Now we gotta see how many bags that is.  Each bag has 110 cups, so 550 cups divided by 110 cups per bag is 5 bags.


5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah does a whole lotta laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so he does 200 pounds. David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so he does 100 pounds.

That means Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David.

100 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

If he buys 18 flowers in packs of 3, that's 18 / 3 = 6 packs.

That'd cost him 6 * $2.50 = $15.00

If he buys them in packs of 2, that's 18 / 2 = 9 packs.

That'd cost him 9 * $1.00 = $9.00

So he saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

$6.00 

"
"Hmm, 30% off of a hundred bucks... lemme see...

That's like, 30 out of every 100, so... 30 dollars off.

70 

"
"Okay, so the two girls got some water first.  

They each got 1/6 of 24 liters, so that's 24 divided by 6, which is 4 liters each.

That means they took 4 liters times 2, which is 8 liters.

Then the boy got 6 liters.

So in total, they took 8 liters plus 6 liters, which is 14 liters.

If they took 14 liters out of 24 liters, then there's 24 minus 14 left.

10 

"
"Okay, so Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he gets more stickers, so we gotta add those up. 10 plus 21 is 31. Then he gets even more! 31 plus 23 is 54.

Now he gives some away, so we gotta take those away. 54 minus 9 is 45.

He uses some for a card too, so we take those away too. 45 minus 28 is 17.


17 

"
"Okay, so Alex weighs 4 times what Grace weighs minus 2 pounds.

That means Alex weighs (4 * 125) - 2 pounds.

Let's see... 4 times 125 is 500.

So Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Okay, so Dan has 3 bushes with 25 roses each. That's 3 times 25, which is 75 roses.

And each rose has 8 thorns, so we gotta multiply 75 by 8.

75 times 8 is 600.


600 

"
"Well, lemme see... they won more than they lost, so gotta figure out the difference.

They won 8 more than they lost, so if we take away those 8 wins, the rest would be even.

That means they won and lost the same amount of games if we take away those extra 8 wins.

So, 22 games split in half is 11 games each.

Now, add back those 8 wins they had extra.

11 + 8 = 19


19 

"
"Let's see... he goes on four trips a year, and he's been doin' that since he was 23.  That's 34 - 23 = 11 years of trips.

So he's got 11 years times 4 trips a year, which is 44 shirts.

44 

"
"Okay, so Greg's alarm is kinda loud, huh?

First time it went off, it rang 4 times.

Second time it was three times longer, so that's 4 times 3, which is 12 times.

Third time it was half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times divided by 2, which is 6 times.

So, all together, it rang 4 + 12 + 6 times.

12 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise every year, right?  And it's 10% of what she made before.

Let's see... 10% of 600 is 60 bucks. So after one year, she makes 660.

Then the next year, she gets another 10% raise on the 660...

*counts on fingers*

That's 66 more dollars. So now she makes 726.

One more year, another 10% raise...

*counts again*

That's 72.60 more dollars. So now she makes 798.60.

Now she's been there for 8 years.  One more year...

*counts again*

That's another 79.86. So now she makes 878.46.


878.46 

"
"Let's see... Marilyn sold way more than Harald.  If we think of it like 10 groups of Harald's sales, that makes 11 groups in total.

88,000 copies / 11 groups = 8,000 copies per group

8,000 



"
"Okay, so she invited 16 friends but some don't come.  She needs 3/4 of a bag for each friend that does come.

Let's see... 16 times 3/4 is 12 bags.

12 bags times $2 each is $24.

"
"Okay, so grown-up dinos eat a whole lotta potato salad, 10 pounds each! Little dinos eat half that, so they eat 5 pounds.

Let's see... 20 big dinos times 10 pounds each is 200 pounds.  And 5 little dinos times 5 pounds each is 25 pounds.

200 plus 25 is... 225!


225 

"
"Okay, so Marcia has two more pets than Cindy who has four. That means Marcia has six pets.

Jan has three times the pets Marcia has, so Jan has 18 pets.

Altogether, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

28 

"
"Corey is 11 cuz James is 10 and Corey is 1 year older.

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so she is 9.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson so Jackson is 4.

"
"Lee is faster than Gerald by 2 seconds.

That means Gerald is slower than Lee by 2 seconds.

If Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald runs it in 40 seconds.

Gerald got 10% faster.

10% of 40 is 4.

Gerald is now 4 seconds faster.

So Gerald runs it in 36 seconds.

36 

"
"Okay, so there's 60 dogs.

And for every dog there's 2 cats, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 cats.

That means there's 120 plus 60, which is 180 cats and dogs.

The rabbits are 12 less than that, so there's 180 minus 12, which is 168 rabbits.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 plus 180 is 348.


348 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 kids in total. Two-fifths of them are boys, so that's 200 divided by 5, which is 40. Then we multiply that by 2, so there are 80 boys.

That means there are 200 minus 80, or 120 girls.

Two-thirds of the girls are in the girl scouts, so that's 120 divided by 3, which is 40. Then we multiply that by 2, so 80 girls are in the girl scouts.

That means 120 minus 80, or 40 girls are not in the girl scouts.

40 

"
"Well, Harry slept a whole lotta hours! James only slept part of what Harry did.  

Let's see... if Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 2/3 of that, then James slept 6 hours.

9 - 6 = 3

"
"Well, she made double the amount of sauce 'cause the tomatoes shrink when you cook 'em down. So she musta used 16 ounces of tomatoes.

And each can has three tomatoes, so...

16 ounces of tomatoes / 16 ounces per can = 1 can

1 can * 3 tomatoes per can = 3 tomatoes

"Mary has 40 ledges times 2 plants per ledge, that's 80 plants.

Then she gets 18 more, so she has 80 plus 18, which is 98 plants.

She gives away 1 plant from each of her 40 ledges, so that's 40 plants.

98 minus 40 is 58.


58 

"
"Let's see...

The second friend pressed the doorbell more times than the first friend.  The third friend pressed the doorbell more times than the fourth friend.

The fourth friend pressed it 60 times, and the third friend pressed it 10 more times than that. So the third friend pressed it 70 times.

The second friend pressed it 1/4 more times than the first friend, who pressed it 20 times. That means the second friend pressed it 5 more times, for a total of 25 times.

Now we add up all the presses: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

"Let's see... Solo needs to read a whole lotta pages!

He's gotta read 4 plus 20 plus 7 plus 8... that's 39 pages in total.

He already read 15, so he's got 39 minus 15 left... that's 24 pages.

He has 4 days to read them, so he needs to read 24 divided by 4...

"
"Well, John drinks water with all his meals, that's three a day.  And he has one before bed too, so that's four glasses a day.  He does this every day from Monday to Friday, so that's five days.  Four times five is twenty.

"
"Well, it takes 10 minutes for every 3 miles.  So, we gotta figure out how many sets of 3 miles are in 42 miles.

That's 42 divided by 3, which is 14.

Then we take 14 and multiply it by 10 minutes.

14 times 10 is 140.


140

"Okay, so Poppy puts down a quarter of the pieces first. That's 1000 divided by 4, which is 250 pieces.

Then there are 1000 minus 250, which is 750 pieces left.

Her mom puts down a third of those, so that's 750 divided by 3, which is 250 pieces.

That means there are 750 minus 250, which is 500 pieces left.


500 

"
"Cody eats a whole lotta cookies! Three times more than Amir's 5 cookies is 15 cookies.

So that's 15 for Cody plus 5 for Amir, which makes...

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how big the insides of the boxes are.  

Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 on the outside, but the walls take up some space. So we gotta take away the wall thickness from each side.

That means the inside is 5-2 by 6-2 by 4-2, which is 3 by 4 by 2.

Now we multiply those numbers together to get the volume of one box: 3 times 4 times 2 is 24.

Since we have 3 boxes, we multiply that by 3: 24 times 3 is 72.

72 

"
"Let's see... Frankie watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, that's 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

Then he watched 1 hour on Thursday plus 30 minutes, which is like half an hour. So that's 1 and a half hours.

On Friday he watched 2 hours.

That's 4 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Hmm, that's more than 7 hours.  

Let's try taking away the half hour from Thursday.

That's 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 hours.

So he watched 7 hours total, and we know it wasn't Wednesday that made it go over.

That means he watched 0 half hour episodes on Wednesday.

0 

"
"Well, he had 110 cookies, but dropped 5, so that's 115. Then he made 15 extra, so that means he meant to make 100 cookies. And since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, he musta made 50 cookies last year.

50 

"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.

That means they save $0.20 x 10 gallons = $2.00 total.

So the gas will cost $3.00 x 10 gallons = $30.00

Then take away the $2.00 they save: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00


$28.00

"Let's see... Beatrice ate 2 times 24 which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell ate 3 times 14 which is 42 roll-ups.  That's a lot of sugary snacks!

To find the average, we add them up and divide by 2. 48 plus 42 is 90. 90 divided by 2 is 45.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia rows 20 feet every 16 seconds.

That means she rows 60 feet every 48 seconds.

The shore is 64 seconds away, so she rows a little more than 60 feet.

She rows 80 feet in 64 seconds.

That means the boat took on 16 liters of water.

"Well, lemme see...

Each teacher uses the board twice a day, and they clean it 3 times each lesson. So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 times per teacher.

Then there are 4 teachers, so we gotta multiply that by 4.

6 times 4 is 24.

"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds a whole lotta pictures, way more than Brittany's.  Brittany's phone can hold a bunch of pictures too, but not as many as Jamal's.  

Let's see... Jamal's phone holds 1800 pictures, and that's 6 times more than Brittany's. So Brittany's phone can hold 1800 divided by 6, which is 300 pictures.

Now, Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than there are ducks in Jamal's picture. So there are 300 pictures divided by 50, which is 6 ducks.

"
"Okay, so lumber's gone up a lot, huh?  That's good for Sasha!

Let's see... she's got ten of them 2x4s, and they cost her ten bucks a pop. So that's ten times ten, which is a hundred dollars.

Then she's got five of them 4x4s, and those were sixteen dollars each.  Five times sixteen... hmm... carry the one... that's eighty dollars.

So the 2x4s were a hundred, and the 4x4s were eighty.  A hundred plus eighty is one hundred and eighty dollars.

That's how much she spent. Now she's gonna sell 'em for more since prices went up.

"
"Okay, so Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water.  That's like 7 + 13 = 20 parts in total.

If she used 120 teaspoons and cups in all, we gotta figure out what 7 parts out of 20 is.

So, 120 divided by 20 is 6.

Then, 6 times 7 is...

"
"Okay, so John buys 2 shoes for each kid, and he has 3 kids. That's 2 times 3, which is 6 shoes.

"Well, lemme see...

He started with 2 containers times 5 cars each, that's 10 cars.

"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40000 four years ago. That means his salary was 30% more than Lylah's.

To find Lylah's salary, we gotta figure out what 30% of Adrien's salary is. That's $40000 times 0.30, which is $12000.

So Lylah was making $40000 - $12000 = $28000 four years ago.

Now, Adrien's salary went up by 40%. That means he's making 40% more than his old salary of $40000.

40% of $40000 is $40000 times 0.40, which is $16000.

So Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Lylah's salary also went up, but we don't know by how much.

To find their total salary four years later, we add Adrien's new salary to Lylah's old salary: $56000 + $28000 = $84000.



$84000 

"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So that's 2 times 30, which is 60 sheets a week.

"Let's see... Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.

Kael has 5 apples * 2 = 10 apples.

And Kael has 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges.

Together they have 13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits.

"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less for the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours.

Let's see... Monday was 8 hours, then two days at 6 hours each is 6 x 2 = 12 hours.

The rest of the week she slept 7 hours a day for 4 days, so that's 7 x 4 = 28 hours.

Now we add it all up: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Well, Rosie runs real fast at first, 10 miles every hour for 3 hours. That's a lot of miles!  

So that's 10 times 3, which is 30 miles.

Then she slows down to 5 miles an hour. She runs for 4 more hours, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 miles.

Now we add those together, 30 plus 20, which is 50 miles.

"Okay, so let's see...

Watermelons cost three times what peppers cost, and peppers are 15 dollars, so watermelons are 3 * 15 = 45 dollars each.

Oranges cost 5 dollars less than watermelons, so they are 45 - 5 = 40 dollars each.

Now, Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so that's 4 * 45 = 180 dollars.

He buys 20 peppers, so that's 20 * 15 = 300 dollars.

And he buys 10 oranges, so that's 10 * 40 = 400 dollars.

To find the total, we add up the cost of everything: 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 dollars.

"Okay, so Joseph spent less in June.  

If he spent $60 less in June, that means he spent $500 - $60 = $440 in June.

"Let's see... Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. That's 2 + 4 = 6 rides on the roller coaster.

They both rode the luge twice, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they went on 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.

"
"Well, on Tuesday he walked a whole lot more than Monday, six times more! That's 4 times 6, which is 24 miles.

So Monday and Tuesday he walked 4 plus 24, which is 28 miles.

That means on Wednesday he walked 41 minus 28, which is 13 miles.

13 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 4 washes a month, and there's 12 months in a year. So that's 4 times 12, which is 48 washes.

Now, each wash is 15 bucks, so 48 times 15...  

720

"Okay, so let's see...

Two subs cost 2 times $7.50, which is $15.00.

Two bags of chips cost 2 times $1.50, which is $3.00.

Two cookies cost 2 times $1.00, which is $2.00.

So the food alone is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Delivery is 20% of $20.00, so that's $4.00.

Adding the tip, it's $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00


29.00 

"
"Well, lemme see...

He did 5 questions every hour, and the first test had 75 questions. So he finished that one in 15 hours, 'cause 75 divided by 5 is 15.

The second test had 100 questions, and he did 5 an hour, so that's 20 hours to finish it all.

But he only had 6 hours for the second one, so he only did 30 questions, 'cause 5 times 6 is 30.

That means he left 70 questions on the second test, 'cause 100 minus 30 is 70.


70 

"
"Okay, so you got them blue gumballs, right?  Four times that many blue ones would be a lot of pink ones!  And then you gotta add 22 more pink ones on top of that.

"
"Hmm, let's see... 20 cars total, 12 automatic, and 4 manual... that means there's 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

4 / 20 * 100 = 20

"
"Well, lemme see... if there's twice as many babies as queens, and twice as many workers as babies... that's a lot of bees!

Let's say there's 1 queen. Then there's 2 babies for every queen, so that's 2 babies. And for every 2 babies, there's 4 workers.

So that's 1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers = 7 bees.

But we got 700 bees, not 7.  

Hmm... lemme try again. If we got 10 queens, that's 20 babies and 40 workers.

That's 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 bees.

Still not enough!

This is harder than I thought!

...

...

Okay, I think I got it!

If we keep goin' like that, we gotta figure out how many times 70 goes into 700.

That's 10 times!

So if we got 10 groups of 7 bees, that's 10 queens, 20 babies, and 40 workers in each group.

That means there's 40 workers times 10 groups, which is...

400

"Okay, so John buys some food and some other stuff.  The food is milk and eggs.  The other stuff is light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

Let's see, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Ten percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar.

So the tax is 1 dollar.

Now we add up all the stuff: 2 + 3 + 10 + 1 = 16 dollars.

"Okay, so Kim's got 3 clients already and thinks he'll get 5 more. That's 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so that's 2 * $2 = $4 per client on bleach.

They also need a pack of cloths for $5.

So, each client costs him $4 + $5 = $9.

With 8 clients, his total expenses are $9 * 8 = $72.

He makes $92 and spends $72, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"Well, he's got 10 hectares and each one has 100 pineapples, so that's 10 times 100, which is 1000 pineapples.

And he harvests them every 3 months, so in a year, that's 4 times.

So, he gets 1000 pineapples times 4 harvests...

1000 * 4 = 4000


4000
"
"Okay, so he has one box with 500 pieces.

Another box has 3 times that, so that's 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces.

The last box has 1/4 the pieces of the first box, so that's 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

"
"Okay, so first Debra saw 30 bees leave. Then half of that came back, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

Then twice as many bees left, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 bees.

That means a total of 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees flew out.

Since all the bees that left before came back, 105 bees came back in the last 6 hours.

"Well, Charlie has 12 friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy. So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends.

James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"
"Okay, so Steve has to go further, but he's faster.  Let's see...

First, we gotta figure out how long it takes Steve to get home.  He goes 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet (cause there's 5,280 feet in a mile).  

If he goes 440 feet every minute, we divide the total feet by his speed: 15,840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes.

Now Tim. He's going 2 miles, which is 10,560 feet. He goes 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10,560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes.

Steve gets home first, so we gotta see how much longer Tim takes. 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"Let's see... 5 bikes with 2 tires each is 10 tires.

3 tricycles with 3 tires each is 9 tires.

And the unicycle has 1 tire.

So that's 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

20 tires times 25 cents each is 500 cents.

500 cents is equal to $5.00

"Okay, so Dave ate fourteen fries. That sneaky seagull ate half of that, which is seven fries.

Then those pigeons came along and ate three fries each, so that's nine fries gone.

The raccoon was a real jerk, taking two thirds of what was left.  

And then just one fry for the ants.

Let's see... five fries left means there were six before the ants got to them.

Six times three is eighteen fries before the pigeons.

Eighteen plus seven is twenty-five fries before the seagull.

And twenty-five plus fourteen is thirty-nine fries in the pack at the start.

"
"Let's see... Kimo has three classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and each class is an hour long. So that's 3 classes times 1 hour, which is 3 hours each day.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes that are 2 hours each, so that's 2 classes times 2 hours, which is 4 hours each day.

He has class 3 days a week with 3 hour-long classes, so that's 3 days times 3 hours, which is 9 hours.

He has class 2 days a week with 4 hour-long classes, so that's 2 days times 4 hours, which is 8 hours.

In total, he has 9 hours plus 8 hours, which is 17 hours of class each week.

Over 16 weeks, that's 17 hours times 16 weeks, which is 272 hours.

"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of stuff!

Let's see... rolls are 4 inches, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is 4/12 = 1/3 of a foot long.

He makes 300 of those, so that's 300 times 1/3, which is 100 feet of rolls.

Croissants are 6 inches, so they're 6/12 = 1/2 a foot long.

He makes 120 of those, so that's 120 times 1/2, which is 60 feet of croissants.

Baguettes are tricky, they're two feet long already!

So that's 60 times 2, which is 120 feet of baguettes.

Now we add it all up: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet!

"Let's see... monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, gorillas eat 400, and baboons eat 100. That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100 yard field. That's like running 100 yards, then back 100 yards, over and over. So he runs 15 times 100 yards, which is 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, so that's 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does that 34 times. So that's 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards.

Then you add her first 200 yards, so she runs a total of 2920 yards.

Kelly runs farther than Blake.

2920 - 1500 = 1420

"Let's see... Anakin got 10 starfish and Locsin got 5 less, so that's 10 - 5 = 5 starfish for Locsin.

Anakin got 6 seahorses and Locsin got 3 less, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses for Locsin.

Anakin got 3 clownfish and Locsin got 2 more, so that's 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish for Locsin.

Now, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

"Okay, so the price goes up by 20% every two months. That means it goes up a lot over a whole year!

Let's see... 36 months is like 18 sets of two months. So the price goes up 20% eighteen times.

"Lemonade is mighty tasty on a hot day!

He gives half of that to charity, so that's 2500 / 2 = 1250 gone.

He still has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left.

Now he gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, so that's 200 + 700 = 900 gone.

That leaves him with 1250 - 900 = 350.


350 

"
"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more than Monic, so Rani has 46 crabs.

To find the total, we add up the crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122


122
"
"Okay, so Lloyd makes $10 every hour.

He worked 5 hours the first week, so that's 5 times $10, which is $50.

The second week he worked 8 hours, so that's 8 times $10, which is $80.

To find out how much he made in total, we add the two weeks together: $50 + $80 = $130


$130
"
"Okay, so the winner got most of the votes, right?  That means the loser got the rest.

If 3/4 voted for the winner, then 1/4 must have voted for the loser.

So, we gotta figure out what 1/4 of 80 is.

That's like cutting the class into four equal groups, and the loser got one of those groups.

80 divided by 4 is 20.

"
"Let's see...

Sandra got 200 of them pink flowers, and that's five times the number of white ones. So she musta got 200 divided by 5, which is 40 white carnations.

She got four times as many red roses as white carnations, so that's 40 times 4, which is 160 red roses.


160 

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30.  Mark is younger than Jan. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  Hmm, lemme see... half of Jan's age two years ago was 14. So Mark was 19 two years ago. That means Mark is 21 now.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 23.

23 

"
"Okay, so the first team is fast, all runnin' the same.  The other team, they're slower at first but gettin' quicker.

Let's see... the slower team's first guy is 60 seconds. Then the next one is 57, then 54, then 51.

Add those up: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The fast team, they all run 55 seconds, so that's 55 x 4 = 220 seconds.

222 minus 220 is 2.


2 

"
"Well, there's three numbers bigger than 3 on a die, right? 4, 5, and 6. So that's half the numbers.

Rollin' two even numbers in a row... hmm. You gotta get an even number first, then another one.  That's gotta be harder.

Let's see... half the numbers are even, so it's like a 50/50 shot each time.

50% chance of gettin' an even number the first time, then another 50% chance the second time.

So that's... 50 times 50... which is 25%.

So, rollin' a number bigger than 3 is twice as likely as rollin' two even numbers.

That's 100%.

"Jenna picked 10 apples cause her momma got 20 and she only got half.

"Okay, so Russell gave the hamsters 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw = 50 pieces of straw.

He also gave the rabbits 20 pieces of straw.

That means the rats got 160 total pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces of straw.

If each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats.

Since the rats are in 3 cages, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"
"Okay, so Mandy owes money and it gets bigger each month.  

Let's see... 2% of 100 is 2 dollars. So after one month, she owes 102 dollars.

Then another 2% on that... that's another 2 dollars, so now it's 104.

One more month, another 2 dollars... that makes it 106.


106 

"
"Okay, so he buys the wheat for $20 a bag and it costs $2 more to move it, so that's $22 spent on each bag.

He sells them for $30 each, so he makes $8 profit on each bag ($30 - $22 = $8).

To make $400 profit, he must have sold 50 bags ($400 / $8 = 50).


50 

"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

Then they spent $33.00 per ride and went on 2 rides, so that's $33.00 x 2 = $66.00 on rides.

Now let's add up all the costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66.00 = $102.00

They split the cost evenly between 3 friends, so each friend pays $102.00 / 3 = $34.00


$34.00 

"
"Well, let's see... he collects peaches for a long time, three whole hours! And he's fast, two peaches every minute.  

So, there are lots of minutes in an hour, sixty I think.

So, he collects peaches for three times sixty minutes, that's a lot of minutes!

Then you gotta multiply that by two peaches every minute.

"
"Well, lemme see... ten ducks times 3.5 pounds each... that's 35 pounds a week.

Now, there's seven days in a week, so we gotta divide that 35 pounds by 7 days.

35 divided by 7 is... 5.

"
"Okay, so Tom plants a bunch of trees but also cuts some down.  He starts with 50, so that's good.

He plants 10 and cuts down 2 each year, so that's like planting 8 more each year.

Over 10 years, that's 8 times 10, which is 80 more trees.

So he has 50 plus 80, that's 130 trees.

But then 30% die, so we gotta figure out what that is.

30% of 130... hmm... that's tricky.

Let's see... 10% of 130 is 13, so 30% is 3 times that, which is 39 trees.

So he loses 39 trees.

130 minus 39 is... 91 trees.


91 

"
"Okay, so they started with 18 pink ones. Then they took away a third, which is 6, cuz 18 divided by 3 is 6.  So there were 12 pink ones left. They painted the 6 white ones and put them back. Then they added 18 more pink ones, so that's 30 pink ones.

"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil plus an eraser. That means a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens cost $1.50 x 8 = $12.00

"Okay, so Elaine started with 20 cards.

Then she got three times that, so that's 20 x 3 = 60 more cards.

That means after the first month she had 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

The next month she got 20 less than the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the last month she got twice the amount from the first two months, so that's 60 + 40 = 100 cards x 2 = 200 cards.

Now she has a whole bunch! 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

"
"Okay, so Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents a sentence, so that's 500 times 5 cents, which is 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so that's 5 cents times 2, which is 10 cents a sentence.

So for Publisher B, he makes 500 times 10 cents, which is 5000 cents.

To find out how much he makes in total, we add up what he makes from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.


7500

"He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so that's 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

"Let's see... he eats two slices of cheese on his sandwich every day, and he eats a sandwich every day for a whole week, so that's 2 times 7 which is 14 slices.

His omelets have one more slice than his sandwiches, so that's 3 slices. He eats those 3 days a week, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 slices.

And then there's the macaroni and cheese, which has 8 slices.

So, all together, he used 14 + 9 + 8 slices of cheese.

14 + 9 + 8 = 31

"Let's see... Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow, that's 32 pens.

She got 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag has 9, so that's 6 times 9, which is 54 blue pens.

She also got 2 bags of red pens, and each has 6, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 red pens.

Now we add all the pens together: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98

"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average, and she can drop her lowest score.  Let's see... her lowest score is a 71.

To get a 93 average across six tests, she needs a total score of 558 (93 x 6 = 558).

If we take away her 71, her total score from the other five tests is 438 (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 83 = 438).

That means she needs a 120 on her last test (558 - 438 = 120).

"Okay, so Micheal rode his bike a lot!

First, he rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week.

He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, so that's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers every week.

He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total, we add the kilometers from both parts: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hmm, lemme see...

Each apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, so that's 40 grams divided by 2, which is 20 grams.

So, the apples weigh 20 grams each times 80 apples, that's 1600 grams.

The chocolate bars weigh 40 grams each times 25 bars, so that's 1000 grams.

Altogether, that's 1600 grams plus 1000 grams.

1600 + 1000 = 2600

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much twenty dozen cups cost.

First, half a dozen plates cost 6000 dollars a plate times 6 plates, which is 36000 dollars.

Then, twenty dozen cups cost 36000 dollars minus 1200 dollars, which is 34800 dollars.

Now, twenty dozen is twenty times twelve, which is 240 cups.

So, each cup costs 34800 dollars divided by 240 cups.

"Okay, so Sara needs to figure out how much money she needs.

The jacket is $30 and the shoes are $20 each, so that's $20 + $20 = $40 for the shoes.

That means she needs $30 + $40 = $70 in total.

She already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Babysitting earns her $5 each time, and she did that 4 times, so that's $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting.

That means she still needs $60 - $20 = $40.

Mowing the lawn gets her $4 each time, so she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 times.

"Let's see...

If the white chickens lay more eggs, he must have more white chickens.  

Hmm, maybe if I try some numbers...

If he had 5 red chickens, that's 15 eggs (5 chickens x 3 eggs).

If he had 7 white chickens, that's 35 eggs (7 chickens x 5 eggs).

That's 50 eggs total, too many!

Let's try less white chickens...

If he had 6 white chickens, that's 30 eggs (6 chickens x 5 eggs).

If he had 4 red chickens, that's 12 eggs (4 chickens x 3 eggs).

That's 42 eggs total!

"Gotta figure out how far he walks first.  That park's a rectangle, so you add up all the sides.  

1.5 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 15 miles

15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours

"Okay, so she counted 100 the first day, and then 50 more the next day, so that's 150.

"Well, lemme see... both pools are losin' water at the same rate, so the difference between 'em is shrinkin' by 4 gallons every minute.

If the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the difference between 'em shrunk by three times the small pool's current amount.

So, three times the small pool's current amount is equal to 4 gallons times 4 minutes, which is 16 gallons.

That means the small pool has 16 gallons / 3.

"Okay, so Janeth owes $2000 plus 10%, which is like an extra $200. So she owes a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 a month for 12 months, that's $165 times 12, which is $1980.

So, if she pays $1980 of the $2200 she owes, she'll still owe $220.

"Hmm, lemme see...

"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now. That means Zack is twice her age, so he's 21 times 2 which is 42. Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so he's 21 times 3 which is 63.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Zack will be 45, and Adrian will be 66.  

To find the average, we add up their ages: 24 + 45 + 66 = 135. Then we divide by 3 because there are three of them: 135 divided by 3 is 45.


45 

"
"Okay, so Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so that's 68 divided by 2 plus 10.  That's 34 plus 10, so Yuri scored 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 plus 17, which is 85 points.

So far, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of the other three from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Okay, so Celine started with 120 liters and used 90 liters. That means she had 120 - 90 = 30 liters left.

Then she collected twice that amount in rainwater, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 liters.

Now she has the 30 liters she had left plus the 60 liters of rainwater, for a total of 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

"Okay, so Andy plants less petunias than geraniums.  He plants 40 less petunias.

So, 90 geraniums minus 40 is 50 petunias.

"Okay, so they spent some money one year, then spent a third of that the next year.

"Okay, so Carlos pays $30 for each hour, and he uses the canoe for 3 hours. That's 30 times 3, which is 90 dollars.

Benji pays $18 an hour and uses the raft for 5 hours. So that's 18 times 5, which is 90 dollars too.

To find out how much they pay together, we add up what they each pay: 90 plus 90 is 180.


180 

"
"Well, if it takes 6 days by bus, and half as long by car, that means the car trip takes 3 days.

"Okay, lemme see...

Burrito is six fifty, then he adds two bucks for meat, a dollar for cheese, a dollar for avocado... that's ten fifty so far.

Then two sauces at a quarter each, so that's another fifty cents.  Ten fifty plus fifty cents is eleven dollars.

He wants the meal deal for three more bucks, so now it's fourteen dollars.

He has a five dollar gift card, so fourteen minus five...

"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute. Her mom is slower, she only does half of that, so she does 2 pieces a minute.

Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces every minute.

That means to do 360 pieces, it'll take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour.

"
"Okay, so first, Ashlyn took 30% of 120 melons, which is like 30 out of every 100.  That's 36 melons.

Then, there were 120 - 36 = 84 melons left.

She took 3/4 of those, which is like 63 melons.

That means 84 - 63 = 21 melons were still not ready.


21 

"
"Okay, so he buys 12 cars at $20,000 each. That's 12 times 20,000... which is 240,000.

Then he pays 10% tax.  That's like 10 out of every 100, so 10/100 times 240,000... which is 24,000.

So now it's 240,000 plus 24,000... that's 264,000.

And then he pays 1000 for each car, so that's 12 times 1000... which is 12,000.

Finally, we add that to the other stuff: 264,000 plus 12,000...

276,000

"Well, Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and that's twice as many as his girlfriend. So his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes a day.

He needs enough tomatoes for himself, so that's 6 a day.

A vine gives 3 tomatoes a week, which is like 3 tomatoes a day times 7 days.

So he needs 6 tomatoes a day / 3 tomatoes per vine = 2 vines.

"Okay, so 30% went out through A. That's 1000 times 0.30 which is 300 students.

That leaves 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

"Well, John has a whole lotta candies, twice as many as Robert.  If John has 54, that means Robert has 27 candies (54 split in half).

James has 6 more than Robert, so he's got 33 candies (27 plus 6).

Now, to find out how many more John has than James, we gotta subtract. 54 minus 33 is...

"Okay, so Mike don't write to as many folks no more. He only writes to 3 people now.

They each send 2 letters a week, and he sends 2 back, so that's 4 letters a week per person.

That's 3 people times 4 letters each, for a total of 12 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters times 5 pages, which is 60 pages a week.

He writes a page every 6 minutes, so that's 60 pages times 6 minutes per page, which is 360 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he writes for 360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours.

"Okay, so Jason talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, and that's 15 times 30 days, which is 450 minutes.

He also used 300 minutes extra.

"Let's see...

There's a whole lotta snails!  

32 snails minus 4 snails is 28 snails. That's the difference.

She gets her makeup done 4 times a week, and it takes 6 hours each time, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 hours a week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, so that's 24 hours a week times 5 weeks, which is 120 hours total.

Her makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so 120 hours times $250 is $30,000.

But wait, there's a discount! 10% of $30,000 is $3,000.

So, $30,000 minus $3,000 is $27,000.


27000 

"
"Let's see... she spent twelve plus forty-three plus fifteen plus four plus twenty-two dollars. That's ninety-six dollars in total.

96 / 3 = 32

"
"Okay, so he got 4 bags times 50 pounds each... that's a lotta onions!  So 4 times 50 is 200 pounds.

Then each pound costs a buck fifty... so 200 times 1.50...

300 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

Sue ate a lot of cookies!  

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times her sister's 5 cookies, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice her sister's 13 cookies, so that's 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

So Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

That means Sue ate 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 28 * 200 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

"
"Let's see...

There are 60 students in total (20 students per class times 3 classes).

Half the school are boys, so there are 30 boys.

The first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

That means there are 30 - 27 = 3 boys in the first two classes.

So there must be 30 - 3 = 27 boys in the third class.

27 

"
"Okay, so Travis starts with 61 apps. He gets rid of some, then gets more.

Let's see... 61 minus 9 is 52. Then we add 18.

52 plus 18 is 70.

"
"Well, last night he got 10 wolves and 15 cougars, that's a whole lotta critters! Today he got more wolves, three times as many as them cougars. And he got three less cougars than yesterday.

Let's see... three times the cougars from yesterday is 15 times 3, which is 45 wolves. And three less cougars than yesterday is 15 minus 3, which is 12 cougars.

So today he got 45 wolves and 12 cougars. That's a lot of huntin'!

In total, he got 10 wolves + 15 cougars + 45 wolves + 12 cougars.

72 



"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor... so that's 3 times 4, which is 12.

Then he goes up 6 more floors. So 12 plus 6 is 18.


18 

"
"Let's see... Mitchel went down 30 times. Anne went 30% less, so that's like 30 minus a bit.  30% of 30 is... hmm... that's tricky.  

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down a lot!

...

120 

"
"Well, let's see...

He starts with 20 cows in each stall, and that's 10 stalls, so that's 200 cows total.

Then he gets 40 more cows.

He puts those new cows in all 20 stalls, so each stall gets 40 divided by 20, which is 2 more cows.

So now each stall has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we just multiply 22 by 8.

176 

"
"Okay, so he's got a bunch of coins and dollar bills.

* Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 100 pennies is 100 cents, which is a dollar.
* Nickels are worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels is 200 cents, which is 2 dollars.
* Dimes are worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes is 200 cents, which is 2 dollars.
* He's also got 40 dollar bills, so that's 40 dollars.

Now let's add it all up: 1 dollar + 2 dollars + 2 dollars + 40 dollars = 45 dollars


45 

"
"Okay, so the tree is 20 feet tall, and each 10 foot part weighs 400 pounds.  That means there are 20 sections.

So 20 sections times 400 pounds each is 8000 pounds.

But the termites ate some of it. 30% of 8000 is... hmm...  

That's a lot of pounds of wood gone!

8000 minus 2400 is 5600.

"Let's see... eight books times fifty cents is four dollars. Then you gotta add that two dollar fee.

4.00 + 2.00

"
"Okay, so Andrea has 52 apples.

She has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Altogether, they have 52 + 44 + 48 + 24 = 168 fruits.

168 

"
"Okay, so she needs two cups for every 12 cookies.

That's three dozens today, so that's 2 cups times 3 = 6 cups.

Tomorrow she's makin' two and a half dozens, so that's 2 cups times 2.5 = 5 cups.

Altogether, that's 6 plus 5 cups.

"
"Well, lemme see... two thirds of 9,300... that's like splittin' it into three piles and takin' two of 'em.

So, 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100.

And then 3,100 times 2 is 6,200 pennies.

Now, there's 100 pennies in a dollar, right?

So 6,200 pennies divided by 100 is... 62 dollars.

"Let's see... 5 boxes times 50 marbles is 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more.

"
"Let's see... Chris has 6 trees, and Ferdinand has half that, so Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Harry has twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, which is 6 trees. Then Harry has 5 more than that, so he has 11 trees.

Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3, so Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"
"Okay, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

All together they have $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

$400 

"
"Let's see...

The house costs $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of that, so that's $350,000 times 0.05, which is $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12%, so that's $350,000 times 0.12, which is $42,000.

So, the total cost is $350,000 plus $17,500 plus $42,000, which is $409,500.

That's more than her budget of $400,000.

Let's see how much more... $409,500 minus $400,000 is $9,500.


9500 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for a lot of money!

First, we gotta figure out how much he paid in fees. The transfer fee is 3% of $400,000, which is $12,000.

Then there's the brokerage fee, which is 5% of $400,000, so that's $20,000.

Altogether, he paid $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000 in fees.

Now, we subtract the fees and the loan amount from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000


118000 

"
"Okay, so it takes longer to get to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes.

So it takes 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.

That's 28 minutes to heat up plus 23 minutes to cook.

51



"
"Okay, so he bought a bunch of newspaper ads and TV ads.  

Let's see... 50 newspaper ads times $5 each is... hmm... 250 bucks.

And 15 TV ads times $75 each is... carry the one... 1125.

Now we gotta add those together... 250 plus 1125 is... 1375!


1375

"
"Okay, so the second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

That means she has 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms in total.

762 

"
"Let's see... two houses times three bedrooms is six bedrooms.

Six bedrooms times two windows each is twelve windows.

Twelve windows plus four extra windows in each house is sixteen windows per house.

Sixteen windows per house times two houses is thirty-two windows.

"
"Let's see... she spends four dollars and twenty cents, plus nine dollars and forty-five cents, plus one dollar and thirty-five cents. That's a whole lotta numbers!

...

Four plus nine plus one is fourteen. And twenty plus forty-five plus thirty-five is a hundred and...  

Hold on, gotta count that again...

Okay, a hundred and five cents. That's the same as ten dollars and five cents.

So she spends ten dollars and five cents.

Twenty dollars minus ten dollars and five cents...

That's nine dollars and ninety-five cents!

9.95 

"
"Let's see...

The collar takes 900 stitches divided by 10, which is 90 stitches.

The rosette takes 90 stitches times 2, which is 180 stitches.

That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.

That means each sleeve takes (1800 - 1170) / 2 stitches.

"Let's see... 20 packets of tomatoes times $40 each... that's 800 dollars.

"Okay, so the first scene has twice the lines of the song, which is 54 lines times 2, that's 108 lines. But he only says a third of them, so that's 108 divided by 3, which is 36 lines.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 plus 6, which is 60 lines. And he says four-fifths of those, so that's 60 times 4 divided by 5, which is 48 lines.

So in total, he has to memorize 36 plus 48 plus 54 lines.

36 + 48 + 54

"Okay, so Carly had 80 cards.

Two-fifths of them had A, so that's 80 times 2 divided by 5, which is 32 cards.

That leaves 80 minus 32, which is 48 cards.

Half of those had B, so that's 48 divided by 2, which is 24 cards.

That leaves 48 minus 24, which is 24 cards.

Five-eighths of those had C, so that's 24 times 5 divided by 8, which is 15 cards.

That leaves 24 minus 15, which is 9 cards.

"
"Okay, so he digs small holes fast, and big holes take longer.

Let's see... 30 small holes times 3 minutes each... that's 90 minutes.

And 15 big holes times 10 minutes each... that's 150 minutes.

Now we add those together... 90 plus 150 is 240 minutes.

All the cobras have 2800 spots (70 * 40).

All the mambas have 2100 spots (35 * 60).

"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed the team and the coaches, right?

That's 12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 people.

Then there are the guests, 12 team members * 2 guests each = 24 guests.

So, in total, there are 15 people + 24 guests = 39 people to feed.

Now, each pizza feeds 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, each pizza costs $15, so 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones that are each 1 inch long. That's 8 inches total for the topaz.

The necklace is 25 inches long, and the topaz takes up 8 inches, so that leaves 17 inches for the silver beads.

Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so we gotta see how many times 1/4 goes into 17.

17 divided by 1/4 is 68.

The grown-ups get 6 each, and there are 4 of them, so they take 4 times 6, which is 24 bars.

That leaves 40 minus 24, which is 16 bars for the kids.

"Okay, so Susan works from 8 to 11, that's like 3 hours.  But she takes a break for 30 minutes, so that's 30 minutes less.  So she really works for 2 and a half hours.

Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 and a half hours is 150 minutes.

She makes $5 every 10 minutes, so we gotta see how many times 10 goes into 150. That's 15 times.

So she makes $5 times 15, which is...

He did less squats the second day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats.

And he doubled his dumbbell presses, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up all the exercises for both days:

100 + 120 + 50 + 40 + 20 + 40 = 370

"Okay, so they eat rice twice a day, lunch and dinner.

That's 0.2 kg per person per meal times 2 meals a day, so 0.4 kg per person.

And there are 5 people, so that's 0.4 kg times 5 people, which is 2 kg of rice they eat every day.

Now, we gotta see how many days the 42 kg bag will last.

That's 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day, which is 21 days.

Now, to find out how many weeks that is, we divide the number of days by 7 days per week.

So, 21 days divided by 7 days per week is 3 weeks.

"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles a day.

He drives 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles a week.

He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles a year.

That's gonna cost him 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for the miles.

He also gives a $150 bonus each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 for the bonus.

So in total, he pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year.

Twice the number she sold this year is 45 * 2 = 90 books.

And he gets an extra $300 every week 'cause the company is doing good.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

"Let's see... Offense is double the defense, and special teams is half the defense.  That means if we add up offense, defense, and special teams, it's like defense plus double defense plus half a defense.

To find out how many are on defense, we gotta divide 105 by 3.5.

"Okay, so the magazine costs half of what the book costs, which is $4.  That means the magazine costs $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so it costs $1.

"
"Let's see... Jam has 26 pencils and 2 are loose, so that means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

If each box has the same amount, then she has 24 / 3 = 8 pencils in each box.

Now, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils together.

If each box holds 8 pencils, they need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

"
"Well, she needs to add a lot of ice cubes to make it 65 degrees colder.  Each one takes away 13 degrees, so that's 65 divided by 13... hmm... that's 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes it weaker by 12 milliliters, so 5 cubes is 5 times 12... that's 60 milliliters weaker from the ice.

And then she adds 15 milliliters of cream, so that's another 15 milliliters weaker.

So, 60 plus 15 is... 75.


75 

"
"Well, if they get 1 new record for every 2 old ones, and they got 7 new records, that means they musta brought in... lemme see... 7 times 2...

"
"Okay, so Jaime told me there are 100 people working there.  He also said 2 out of every 5 people are junior programmers.  That means there are 40 junior programmers (100 / 5 * 2 = 40).

Each junior programmer makes $2000, so they all make $80,000 together (40 * $2000 = $80,000).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2400 each ($2000 + $400 = $2400).

There are 60 senior programmers (100 - 40 = 60).

So all the senior programmers make $144,000 together (60 * $2400 = $144,000).

To find the total, we add the junior programmers' pay and the senior programmers' pay: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000


224000 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

They had 20 people on the bus going to the third stop. Before that, 7 got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people.

Then 8 got on at the second stop, so before that there were 27 - 8 = 19 people.

And 5 got on at the first stop, so there were 19 - 5 = 14 people at the start.


14 

"
"Okay, so Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, so that's 24 - 2 = 22.

Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 left.

He buys twice the number he gave away, so that's 14 x 2 = 28 more lollipops.

Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more, so that's 36 - 3 = 33.

Then he eats 2 more, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.


31 

"
"Well, it needs to go up 40% more, right?  'Cause 100% - 60% is 40%.

So, if it goes up 1% every 3 minutes, that's 40 times 3 minutes...

Let's see... 40 times 3 is 120 minutes.

And there's 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is 2 hours.


2 

"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and gets 10 more, so that's 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then she gives 3 away, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

14 

"
"Okay, so they spent $80 last time, so that's $80 / $20 = 4 sets of $20.

That means they got $1 x 4 = $4 in rewards.

This time they spent $43, and their rewards took off $4.

Their coupon took off twice the rewards, so that's $4 x 2 = $8.

So, they paid $43 - $4 - $8 = $31.


31 

"
"Okay, so Job A pays $15 times 2000 hours, which is $30,000.  But then they take out 20%, so that's $30,000 times 0.20, which is $6,000 in taxes. So Job A leaves Nick with $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000, but then they take out $6,000 for property tax, leaving $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then they take out 10% for income tax, which is $36,000 times 0.10, or $3,600. So Job B leaves Nick with $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Job B pays $32,400 and Job A pays $24,000, so the difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.



$8,400 

"
"Okay, so there's a bunch of castles in Scotland, right?  Some are all busted up, and some of those busted ones ain't got nobody watchin' over 'em.

Let's see... 40 percent of 220 castles is... hmm... that's a lot of countin'.  

*counts on fingers*

That's 88 castles that are all busted up.

And half of those are empty? So that's...

*counts on fingers again*

44 castles.

"
"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 first and then $350 every month for 6 months. That's like $350 times 6, which is $2100.  So that's $1350 plus $2100, which is $3450 total.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 first and then $250 every month for 9 months. So that's $250 times 9, which is $2250.  Add that to the $1100, and it's $3350.

Let's see, $3450 minus $3350 is...

$100 

"
"Let's see... they gotta split all the guns up even.

So first we gotta add up all the guns: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Then we divide the guns by the number of guys: 24 / 4 = 6 guns each.

"
"Okay, so he needs 30 ounces for each batch of suckers, and he's makin' 8 batches. That's 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces.

Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.

So, all together, that's 240 plus 70.

240 + 70 = 310


310
"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares times $8 a share, that's $64.

The first year it goes up 50%, so that's half of $64, which is $32.  Add that to the original price, and it's $96.

The second year it goes down 25%, so that's a quarter of $96, which is $24. Take that away from $96, and you get $72.


72 

"
"Okay, so Thomas ate three times more than Luke's 2 hot dogs, so that's 2 times 3 which is 6 hot dogs.

John ate half of what Thomas ate, so that's 6 divided by 2 which is 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more John ate than Luke, we subtract Luke's hot dogs from John's: 3 - 2 = 1

"
"Let's see... 200 students split into 3 groups... two groups are the same size, and the other is smaller by 10.

Hmm, that's tricky.

"
"Let's see... if he has twice as many chickens as cows, that means for every cow, there are two chickens.

So, if we think of the cows as groups, each group has one cow and two chickens, that's three animals in total.

He has 60 animals, so that's 60 divided by 3, which is 20 groups.

That means he has 20 cows and 40 chickens (20 times 2).

Now, cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2.

So, the cows have 80 legs (20 times 4) and the chickens have 80 legs (40 times 2).

All together, that's 160 legs.

160 

"
"Well, he starts with 3 balls, then adds one each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 balls.

But then he drops 3, and loses 1, so that's 7 - 3 = 4 balls, then 4 - 1 = 3 balls.


3 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

The blue beetle and green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weight of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so we need to add that too: 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"
"Let's see...

Her friend gave her 24, and she got twice that at her shower, so that's 24 x 2 = 48.

Then her mom gave her 15 more, so she has 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits.

87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters now. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, so that's 5000 divided by 5, which is 1000.

So he runs 1000 more meters, making it 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.

Now, June has 30 days.

So, in June he runs 6000 meters a day times 30 days, which is 180,000 meters.

180000

"
"Okay, so Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, that's 4 times 5 which is 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 times 7 which is 7 cookies.

Together they eat 20 plus 7 which is 27 cookies.

That means Jenny eats 36 minus 27 which is 9 cookies.

9 

"
"Okay, so the shirts cost $30 each, and he got 40% off.  That means each shirt cost $30 - ($30 x 0.40) = $18.

So two shirts would cost $18 x 2 = $36.


36
"
"Okay, so they used to make 10 tractors times $100 each, so that's $1000 a day.

Now they make 5 silos times $220 each, so that's $1100 a day.

That's $100 more than before.

$100 is what percent of $1000?  

Hmm, that's tricky.  I know 10 percent of $1000 is $100.

"
"Okay, so let's see...

Food is $25 a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 x 4 = $100 a month on food.

Then she spends $20 on treats and $100 on medicine.

So all together it's $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 a month.

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so that's $220 x 12 = $2640 a year.


2640 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Yoga is one hour.

Cookin' class is three times that, so three times one hour is three hours.

Cheese tastin' is a half hour.

Museum tour is half the cookin' class, so that's three hours divided by two, which is one and a half hours.

Errands are two hours.

Now, add it all up: one plus three plus a half plus one and a half plus two...

That's seven and a half hours.

7.5

"Okay, so they need double the pots for roses compared to daisies. That's 30 times 2, which is 60 pots for roses.

In total, they need 30 + 60 = 90 pots.

April has 100 pots and needs 90, so she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over.

10 

"
"Well, she had $36 and spent $11 on a sweater, so that's $36 - $11 = $25 left.

Then she gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

That means she saved $21.

21
"
"Okay, so John boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

That's a total of 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours for boating, swimming, and shows.

That 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation, so to find the total time, we gotta figure out what 100% is.

If 30% is 15 hours, then 1% is 15 / 30 = 0.5 hours.

That means 100% is 0.5 * 100 = 50 hours.

Sightseeing was 40% of his time, so he spent 50 * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.


20 

"
"Let's see... she makes $10 times 20 hours at her first job, so that's $200.

Then she makes $5 times 15 hours at her second job, so that's $75.

Altogether, she makes $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

She already has $80, so she has $275 + $80 = $355 saved up.

The phone costs $400, so she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.


45 

"
"Okay, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

That means the two shorter trees together are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.

The tallest tree is twice that, so it's 17 x 2 = 34 feet tall.

34 

"
"Okay, so Dean got $28 from his mama.

He bought 6 cars at $2 each, so that's 6 times 2, which is $12.

Then he got 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5.

So the cars and bears cost $12 plus $5, which is $17.

He had $28 and spent $17, so he had $28 minus $17 left, which is $11.

Then his mama gave him $10 more, so he has $11 plus $10, which is $21.


21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90.

Mini-golf is $5, and she needs to pay for herself too, so that's $5 x 2 = $10 for mini-golf.

Go-karts are $10 a ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 x 2 = $20.

That's $10 + $20 + $5 (for tokens) = $35 spent already.

So she has $90 - $35 = $55 left for friends.

Each friend costs $5 for mini-golf, so she can invite $55 / $5 = 11 friends.

"Marisa gets 500 cents every day.

She spends 100 cents on lollipops every day.

"Okay, so Billy has $10 and candy costs $1.50 a pound.  He buys some candy, then gets change back. He spends half his change on gumballs. Gumballs cost 5 cents each and he got 40 of them.

Let's see... 40 gumballs times 5 cents each is $2.  That means he had $4 before he bought the gumballs 'cause he spent half his change.

So he had $4 plus $2, that's $6 before he bought the gumballs. That means he had $4 in change from the candy.

If he had $4 in change, he spent $6 on candy.

He spent $6 on candy that costs $1.50 a pound.

6 divided by 1.5 is 4.

"
"Let's see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 less than double his son's age.  So if we add 5 to Carver's age, that's double his son's age.

45 + 5 = 50

Now we gotta split that in half to find the son's age.

50 / 2 = 25


25
"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles plus 100 miles, that's 175 miles. Then it goes 50 less than that, so 175 minus 50 is 125 miles.

That means the whole trip is 175 plus 125, which is 300 miles.

It does that trip three times a day, so that's 300 times 3, which is 900 miles a day.

Now we gotta figure out how many days it takes to go 18,000 miles.

18,000 miles divided by 900 miles a day is 20 days.


20 

"
"Okay, so a collie bed needs stuffin' in the middle of a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. That means it needs 5 pounds of stuffin' (8 + 2 divided by 2).

Now, 4 chihuahua beds need 8 pounds of stuffin' (2 pounds per bed times 4 beds).

And 3 collie beds need 15 pounds of stuffin' (5 pounds per bed times 3 beds).

So, all together, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffin' (8 + 15).

23 

"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles there, but then adds 10 more miles, so that's 210 miles.

He drives 70 miles per hour, so that's 210 miles / 70 miles per hour = 3 hours to get there.

Then he drives 240 miles back at 80 miles per hour, so that's 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours to get back.

So the whole trip took 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

6 

"
"Okay, so there are 96 kids in total, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.

Then 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"Well, if there's twice as many boys as girls, that means there's 6 times 2 boys, which is 12 boys.

Then you add the girls and boys together: 12 + 6 = 18

They kicked out 3 folks for not wearin' masks.

Shoplifters is four times that, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12.

Then they kicked out 3 times the shoplifters for fightin', so that's 12 times 3, which is 36.

That's 3 plus 12 plus 36, which is 51.

Wait, they only kicked out 50 people total.

So, 51 minus 50 is 1.

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much all this stuff costs.

First, the picture frames: 44 seniors times $20 a frame is $880.

Now, the etching: 20% of $20 is $4, so each frame costs $24 now.

That's $24 times 44 frames, which is $1056.

The pins are easy: 2 seniors times $5 a pin is $10.

Now the cords: 44 seniors divided by 4 is 11 officers.

11 officers times $12 a cord is $132.

Finally, add it all up: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.



1198 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20% off of $400... that's like a discount, right?

So, 20% of 400 is...  (counts on fingers) ... 80 bucks!

That means the wallpaper would cost $400 minus $80...

320



"
"Okay, so they sold 14 pairs on Friday.

Then on Saturday they sold double, so that's 14 times 2 which is 28 pairs.

Sunday they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 28 divided by 2 which is 14 pairs.

But then 6 people brought shoes back, so we gotta take that away from Sunday's sales.

That's 14 minus 6 which is 8 pairs.

Now we add up all the pairs sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50


50

"Let's see... Tuesdays is one hour, Thursdays is two hours.  Saturdays is twice Tuesdays, so that's two hours.

"
"Hmm, so they bought a whole bunch of stuff, but some of it was broke.  They gotta send that back, right?

Let's see... 40% of the stuff was bad. That means 60% was good.

So we gotta figure out what 60% of $400,000 is.

60/100 * $400,000 = $240,000


$240,000
"
"Let's see... half of 30 sheep is 15.

So, 15 sheep give 1 kg each, that's 15 kg.

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's 30 kg.

15 kg plus 30 kg is... 45 kg.

"Okay, so half the class likes blue, that's 40 / 2 = 20 kids.

That leaves 40 - 20 = 20 kids who don't like blue.

One-fourth of them like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 kids.

The rest like yellow, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 kids.

"
"Lucy sold $56 worth of apples on Monday, and each apple costs $4, so she sold $56 / $4 = 14 apples on Monday.

She picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she picked double the amount from Tuesday, so she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

In total, she picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

50 

"
"Let's see... she washed 10 pairs, that's 10 times 2, which is 20 socks.

Then she washed 15 more, so that's 20 plus 15, which is 35 socks total.

"Okay, so Karan borrowed some money and has to pay it back a little bit each month.  

Let's see... 10% of 3650 is 365. So that's how much extra she has to pay back on top of the money she borrowed.

Now we gotta split that up over five months. 

365 divided by 5 is 73.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the silver: 50 plus 100 is 150. And all the gold: 80 plus 120 is 200.

Finally, we add the silver and gold together: 150 plus 200 is 350.


350 

"
"Okay, so Millie makes 3 pitchers times 12 cups per pitcher, that's 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells 4 cups an hour, so she'll sell all her lemonade in 36 cups divided by 4 cups per hour, which is 9 hours.

She makes $1 per cup and sells 36 cups, so she makes 36 dollars.

She spent $18 on supplies, so she makes 36 dollars minus 18 dollars, which is 18 dollars profit.

She makes 18 dollars profit over 9 hours, so she makes 18 dollars divided by 9 hours, which is 2 dollars profit per hour.

"
"If he sold 3/5 and has 12.8 hectares left, that means the 12.8 hectares is the other 2/5 of his land.

So, if 2/5 is 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 hectares.

That means he had 5/5, or a whole, of 6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares.

"Well, Dasha needs 9 rides and each ride takes 2 tickets. So that's 9 times 2, which is 18 tickets.

Each ticket costs $2, so 18 tickets cost 18 times 2, which is $36.

If they have 165 popsicles total, then each group has 165 divided by 11 popsicles, which is 15 popsicles per group.

Betty has 5 groups, so she has 5 times 15 popsicles, which is 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 groups, so he has 6 times 15 popsicles, which is 90 popsicles.

Sam has 90 minus 75 popsicles more than Betty, which is 15 popsicles.

"Okay, so Tim's gettin' rid of his cable, which costs him sixty bucks a month.  He's gettin' Netflix for ten bucks.  Hulu and Disney Plus together would be twenty bucks, but he gets a discount for gettin' them both.  Twenty percent of twenty is four dollars, so he saves four bucks.  That means Hulu and Disney Plus cost him sixteen dollars a month.

So, Netflix is ten bucks, and Hulu and Disney Plus are sixteen bucks, for a total of twenty-six bucks.

Sixty minus twenty-six is thirty-four.

"
"Okay, so she writes for 4 hours, and recording takes half that, so that's 2 hours.

Then she edits for 90 minutes, which is an hour and a half, so that's 1.5 hours.

Now, let's see... 4 hours plus 2 hours plus 1.5 hours... that's 7.5 hours total.

Editing took 1.5 hours out of 7.5 hours.

Hmm, to get a percentage, you gotta do some dividing. 1.5 divided by 7.5... that's 0.2.

Now, to make it a percentage, you gotta multiply by 100.

0.2 times 100 is 20.

"
"Okay, so Wendy wants to put lotsa books on the shelves.  

First, we gotta figure out how many books fit on the shelves. That's 6 rows times 6 columns, which is 36 spots for books.

Then she wants double that, so that's 36 times 2, which is 72 books.

But wait, she wants 20 MORE than double, so we gotta add 20 to 72. That's 92 books!


92 

"
"Okay, so Erica starts with 20 cards. Her dad gives her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 times 15, which is 30 more cards.  

She had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Then she gives away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

So she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Then she gets 17 more cards.

That means she has 21 + 17 = 38 cards. 


38
"
"Okay, so Bill gets 12 slices divided by 3, which is 4 slices. Mark gets 12 slices divided by 4, which is 3 slices. That's 4 plus 3, which is 7 slices gone.  

12 minus 7 minus 2 is 3.

3 

"
"Well, Mark needs $300 and he only has $50. So he needs to save $250 more.

If he saves $10 each day, that means he needs to save for 25 days.


25 

"
"Okay, so Nancy saw a whole lotta creepy crawlies!

Let's see... she saw 90 spiders.

Millipedes are tricky.  There were 90 spiders divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes.

Now for the stink bugs. That's 30 millipedes times 2, which is 60, then take away 12... so 48 stink bugs.

To find the total, we add 'em all up: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs.

90 + 30 + 48 = 168


168 

"
"Okay, so Beth is 5 years older than Erica, who is 30. That means Beth is 35.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42.

That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica. 

12 

"
"Well, he drank 2 glasses and each glass has 8 ounces, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16 ounces.

Then, each ounce has 3 calories, so 16 times 3 is...

48 

"
"Let's see... he works 4 weeks a month times 6 days a week, so that's 24 days a month.

And there are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 times 12 days, which is 288 days a year.

He makes $50 a day, so he earns 288 times 50 dollars...

288 * 50 = 14400


14400 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs 3 cups times 4, which is 12 cups of flour.  He needs 1 cup times 4, which is 4 cups of milk.

He needs 12 cups of flour and flour comes in 2 cup bags, so he needs 12 divided by 2, which is 6 bags of flour.

He needs 4 cups of milk and milk comes in 2 cup bottles, so he needs 4 divided by 2, which is 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, so he needs 6 minus 2, which is 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

4 

"
"Okay, so Mel uses his AC for 8 hours and wants to cut back by 5 hours. That means he'll use it for 3 hours a day.

He saves 5 hours of use each day.

He saves 5 hours/day * 900 watts/hour = 4500 watts each day.

That's 4500 watts a day, and there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so he saves 4.5 kilowatts a day.

Over 30 days, he saves 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

135 

"
"Okay, so we gotta add up all the stripes and then divide by how many zebras there are.

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.

Another zebra has 36 stripes.

The last zebra has half the stripes of the one with 36, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now we add 'em all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are four zebras in total.

So, 88 stripes divided by 4 zebras is... 22 stripes per zebra.

22 

"
"Okay, so he needs enough for 20 people and each sandwich feeds 4.  That means he needs 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese, so that's 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat.

And 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 a pound, so 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00 for the meat.

The cheese costs $3.00 a pound, so 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00 for the cheese.

So, the total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"
"Okay, so Allan has lotsa cannolis, twice as many corns as cannolis, and then he gets more cannolis.  

Let's see... he starts with 40 cannolis, and that means he has 40 x 2 = 80 corns.

Then he gets 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he loses some corns, 40 less than the new number of cannolis, so he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, to find the total, we add up the cannolis and corns: 100 + 60 = 160


160 

"
"Let's see... he needs 10,000 steps and already did half on his walks to and from school plus 1,000 more. That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

If he only has 2,000 left, he must have done 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps already.

So he did 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps on his jog.

2000 

"
"Okay, so Toby's book has 45 pages and each page has 200 words. That's a lot of words!

Let's see, 45 times 200 is 9000 words in the whole book.

He reads 300 words every minute, so 9000 divided by 300 is 30 minutes to read the whole book.

He needs to leave for the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so that's 50 minutes before he needs to be done reading.

He only takes 30 minutes to read, so he'll be 20 minutes early. 


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 folks in May, and each one gets $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's 15 times 40, which is 600 bucks a week per person.

Now, in June, some folks left. A quarter of them, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 people.

So, in June, they only had 40 minus 10, which is 30 people left.

Let me see... 30 people times $600 a week is... carry the one... 18,000 dollars a week.

Now, we gotta figure out how much they paid in May. That's 40 people times $600 a week, which is 24,000 dollars.

So, for both months, it's 24,000 plus 18,000...

That's 42,000 dollars.


42000 

"
"Okay, so Sally got 2 pounds of taffy.  That's one pound at full price and one pound half off.  So the taffy costs $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The magnets cost $0.25 each, and she got 4, so that's $0.25 x 4 = $1.00.

In total, she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

She started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, so she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.


$3.00 

"
"Okay, so he buys one pack for $400 and another for double that, so that's $400 times 2 which is $800.

That means he spent $400 plus $800 which is $1200 on the two packs.

Then he gets a discount of 20% off, so that's $1200 times 0.20 which is $240 off.

So the two packs cost $1200 minus $240 which is $960.

Then he adds the finale firework which costs $150, so that's $960 plus $150 which is $1110.


1110 

"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days in a month. That means she needs 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

A dozen has 12 cookies, so she needs 60 / 12 = 5 dozens of cookies.

"
"Well, if 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, that's a lot of stinky candles!  And if they're 99% guaranteed not to explode, then 1% will explode.

So, we gotta figure out how many candles are both stinky AND explodey.

1% of 50000 is 500 candles that explode.

5% of those 500 is... hmm... lemme see... 

500 * 0.05 = 25


25 

"
"Okay, so the blouses are 30% off, which means they cost less than $20 each.

First, we gotta figure out how much the discount is.  30% of $20 is like 30 out of every 100, so we do 20 times 0.30.

That's $6 off each blouse.

So each blouse costs $20 - $6 = $14.

Since she buys 4 blouses, the total cost is $14 times 4.

14 * 4 = 56

"
"Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister got twice as many from the tall trees as Joanne, so she got 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

She also got 3 times as many from the short trees, so she got 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees.

That means they got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

Joanne got some from the average trees and her sister got none, so Joanne got all 350 apples from the average trees.

350 

"
"Let's see...

If we think of each hump as one thing, we got 304 humps.

Camels got two humps, so each camel is like two humps.

We gotta figure out how many of those two-hump camels we got.

Hmm... 304 humps divided by 2 humps per camel... that's 152 camels.

Now, we got 180 heads total, and we know we got 152 camels.

That means there's 180 heads - 152 camel heads = 28 dromedaries.

"
"Okay, so Tom traveled 200 kilometers a day for 4 days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Then he traveled 30% of that distance over the next two days, so that's 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He didn't travel on the next day, so that's 0 kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers a day for 7 days, so that's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is 5 inches. Zack's locker is four times bigger than Peter's, so it's 5 times 4, which is 20 inches.

"The second bank gave him $4000 * 2 = $8000.

So in total, he got $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

17000 

"
"Okay, so four boats took 5 cats each, that's 4 times 5, which is 20 cats.

That leaves 50 minus 20, which is 30 cats.

Then 3 out of every 5 of them ran off, so that's 30 divided by 5, which is 6.

Then 6 times 3 is 18 cats that ran off.

So 30 minus 18 is...

12 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

He paid $8 a month for 6 months, so that's 8 times 6 which is 48 bucks.

Then it went up to $12 a month, and he paid that for 8 months, so that's 12 times 8 which is 96 bucks.

After that, it went up to $14 a month, and he's had it for a whole year, which is 12 months, so that's 14 times 12 which is 168 bucks.

Now we gotta add all that up: 48 plus 96 plus 168 is 312.

312 

"
"Okay, so Cole got a deal on both jeans. The jogger jeans were cheaper, right?

Let's see... the tattered jeans were $28, and the jogger jeans were $6 less, so they were $22.

"Let's see...

Them big buses hold a lot of folks, 60 each and there's 4 of them... so that's 60 times 4, which is 240.

The minibuses hold 30 each and there's 6 of them, so that's 30 times 6, which is 180.

And the minivans hold 15 each and there's 10 of them, so that's 15 times 10, which is 150.

Now we gotta add all them up: 240 plus 180 plus 150...

240 + 180 + 150 = 570


570
"
"Well, she made 3 feeders and bought 3, so that's 6 in total.

The store-bought ones get 20 birds each, so that's 3 times 20, which is 60 birds.

Her homemade ones get 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they get 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

That means her 3 homemade feeders get 3 times 30, which is 90 birds.

So in total, she gets 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

150

"Okay, so the soup cost more than the bagel.  It was 25% more, so that's like a quarter more.  A quarter of 4 dollars is... hmm... lemme see... that's a dollar! So the soup was 4 plus 1, which is 5 dollars.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so that's 4 divided by 2... which is 2 dollars.

So, the bagel was 4, the soup was 5, and the cake was 2.  That's 4 plus 5 plus 2...

"
"Kenny had some cards, sold some, and kept some. He sold enough to get $50 for spending money and $50 for the ticket, so he made $100 total.

If he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $100 / $1.50 = 66.66 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he must have sold 67 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of them. If 67 cards are 2/3 of his total, then he started with 67 / (2/3) = 100.5 cards.

Since you can't have half a card, he must have started with 101 cards.

101

"Well, he made enough for 18 people to have two hot dogs, that's 36 hot dogs.  Then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted two each, so that's 80 hot dogs!

* Pots and pans: $120.00
* Bowls: $20.00
* Utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

That's a total of $120 + $20 + $25 = $165.00 before the discount.

Now, 20% off of $165.00 is... hmm...  

That's tricky.  I know 10% of $165 is $16.50, so 20% is double that.

So, 20% off is $16.50 x 2 = $33.00

Take that off the original price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"Let's see... Dora wants to buy things that cost 6 plus 11 plus 2, so that's 19 dollars.

"Okay, so Thaddeus killed a whole bunch of dragons, 100! Arthur used a spear and got three-quarters of that, so that's like... 75 dragons. Walter used a rusty axe and got twice as many as Arthur, so that's 75 times 2, which is 150 dragons. Bruce forgot his sword and only used a nail file, so he got one-fifth of what Walter got.  That's 150 divided by 5, which is...

"Let's see... they got a whole bunch of oranges together.  

First, we gotta add up all the oranges: 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Then we gotta count everyone gettin' oranges: Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends, that's 1 + 1 + 6 = 8 people.

Now we split the oranges up: 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges each.

"Okay, so Antoine needs more onions, double the amount. That's 2 pounds times 2, which is 4 pounds of onions.

He needs 4 pounds of onions at $2.00 a pound, so that's 4 times 2, which is $8.00 for onions.

He also needs 2 boxes of stock at $2.00 a box, so that's 2 times 2, which is $4.00 for stock.

In total, his ingredients cost $8.00 plus $4.00, which is $12.00.

He's making enough soup for 6 people, so each serving costs $12.00 divided by 6, which is $2.00 per serving.

"Okay, so Billie's room is a rectangle, right? And we know the area is 360 square feet.  That means if we multiply the length and width together, we get 360.  

We also know the length is 3 yards, but we need to know the width in feet to figure out the perimeter. There are 3 feet in every yard, so 3 yards is 9 feet.

Now we gotta find the width.  360 divided by 9 is 40, so the width is 40 feet.

To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides. That's 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet.

9 + 40 + 9 + 40 = 98

"Let's see... Elizabeth has 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear, that's 1 + 2 = 3 packs.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

Margareth has way more packs than Elizabeth! 7 - 3 = 4 more packs.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Margareth has 4 * 20 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, so the oven makes the house hotter.  It goes up 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours. So that's 5 times 3, which is 15 degrees hotter.

Then the window cools it down. It cools 2 degrees every 10 minutes, and the window is open for 30 minutes. So that's 30 divided by 10, which is 3 times 2 degrees, or 6 degrees cooler.

So first it's 40 plus 15, which is 55. Then it's 55 minus 6, which is 49.

"Okay, so Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James is 10% faster, so he's gotta be quicker than that.  

Let's see... 10% of 40 is 4 minutes.  So James swims in 36 minutes.

Jon's bike time is an hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he does it in 85 minutes.

Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

He beat James by 10 minutes, so James took 180 minutes.

If James took 180 minutes total, and we know his swim and bike times, we can figure out his run time.

180 - 36 - 85 = 59

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1.25 hours long. That's like an hour and a quarter, right?  So that's 60 minutes plus 15 minutes, which is 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"
"Okay, so the horse eats half a bail of hay for every mile it runs.  It runs for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  If it goes 32 miles in an hour, then in half an hour it goes 16 miles.

That means it eats 16 / 2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so 8 bails cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has 6 * $5 = $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left over.

"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, and a dozen has 12, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 eggs.

Then she has 2 more eggs, so that's 48 plus 2, which is 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses of eggnog.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, so she can put out 10 divided by 5, which is 2 trays.

"Okay, so he sold some shoes cheap and some for more.  Gotta figure out how much he made from each way, then see how much more he made than he spent.

He made 17 * $20 = $340 from the sale on Monday.

That leaves 48 - 17 = 31 shoes to sell to the store.

He made 31 * $25 = $775 from the store.

So in total he made $340 + $775 = $1115.

He spent $576 on the shoes, so he made $1115 - $576 = $539 profit.

"Hmm, so the balloons got more expensive.  Let's see...

If 20 balloons cost $900, then one balloon cost $900 divided by 20, which is $45.

Now they cost $20 more, so each balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Bentley bought 170 balloons, so he paid $65 times 170, which is...

11050 

"
"Well, I ain't no math whiz, but I know a thing or two about drivin'.

You gotta figure out the total distance first, right?

60 miles per hour for 2 hours is 120 miles (60 x 2 = 120).

Then 30 miles per hour for 1 hour is 30 miles (30 x 1 = 30).

So that's 150 miles total (120 + 30 = 150).

Now, the whole trip took 3 hours (2 + 1 = 3).

To get the average speed, you divide the total miles by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, so Jenna has 5 sapphires left.  

That's 5 sapphires times $800 each, which is $4000.

She also has 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so that's $2400.

$4000 plus $2400 is $6400.

"Well, Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day too. So together they eat 8 apples a day.

If they eat 8 apples a day, in 30 days they'd eat 240 apples.

"
"Okay, so Bob's got ten of them garden boxes. Each one is like a big rectangle, right? Two feet wide, eight feet long, and two feet deep.  That's a lotta dirt!

To figure out how much dirt each box needs, we gotta multiply those numbers together: 2 times 8 times 2. That's 32 cubic feet of dirt for each box.

Since he's got ten boxes, we gotta multiply that by ten: 32 times 10. That's 320 cubic feet of dirt total.

Now, each bag has 2 cubic feet of dirt, so we divide the total dirt by the dirt per bag: 320 divided by 2. That's 160 bags of dirt.

Finally, each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag: 160 times 12.

"
"Okay, so there's more green cards than red cards.  

Sixty percent of 15 red cards is like... uh... 60 out of every 100, so that's 9 more green cards than red cards.

So there's 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, all the red and green cards together is 15 + 24 = 39 cards.

And there's the same amount of yellow cards, so that's another 39.

In total, there's 39 + 39 + 15 = 93 cards.

93 

"
"Okay, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then her friend saw half that many, which is 25 fairies. So now there's 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Then 30 flew away, so 75 - 30 = 45 fairies are left.


45 

"
"Let's see... 8 puppies plus 12 puppies is 20 puppies.  And 3 plus 4 is 7 puppies with spots.

So, 7 out of 20 puppies have spots.

To get the percentage, we gotta do some dividin'. 7 divided by 20 is 0.35.

Now we gotta turn that decimal into a percentage.  Move the decimal two places to the right and add a percent sign.

That means 35% of the puppies have spots.

35 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

Now we gotta see how many times 2250 pounds fits into 4500 pounds: 4500 / 2250 = 2

"
"Okay, so Grayson gets two cents for each can and she drinks three cans, so that's two times three, which is six cents.

Then she gets three cents for each bottle and she drinks five bottles, so that's three times five, which is fifteen cents.

So every week she makes six plus fifteen cents, which is twenty-one cents.

Now, there are four weeks in a month, so she makes twenty-one times four cents, which is eighty-four cents.

"
"Okay, so Toni has a lot more plants than Frederick.  Toni has 60% more, which is like... a whole bunch extra.  Let's see... 60% of 10 is 6, so Toni has 16 plants.

"
"Let's see... Miss Maria has lots of cards!

She has six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards, so that's 6 times 25, which is 150 basketball cards.

She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards, so that's 5 times 40, which is 200 baseball cards.

In total, she has 150 plus 200, which is 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students.

"Becky's apples cost 20 * $0.45 = $9.00.

After the discount, Becky paid $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

Kelly's apples cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.

Kelly's discount is $10.00 * 0.10 = $1.00.

After the discount, Kelly paid $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

Kelly paid $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00 more than Becky.

"Okay, so each room has two sheets, and twice as many pillowcases as sheets, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 pillowcases.

Then there are twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's 4 times 2 which is 8 towels.

So each room has 2 sheets + 4 pillowcases + 8 towels + 1 comforter which is 15 pieces of laundry.

Now we gotta multiply that by 80 rooms.

15 times 80 is 1200.

"Okay, so Frank starts with 200 shoes.

He gets 5 pairs on Monday, that's 5 times 2 which is 10 shoes.

Then he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, so that's 15 times 2 which is 30 shoes.

And on Friday he gets 30 pairs, which is 30 times 2, that's 60 shoes.

So now he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 200 shoes.

But then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Okay, so the pen cost $2. The paper cost three times the pen, which is $2 times 3, that's $6. But it cost $1 less than that, so the paper cost $6 - $1 = $5.

So the pen and paper together cost $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10 and the stuff cost $7, so her change is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Okay, so they started with 30 kids times 10 pencils each, that's 300 pencils.

Then they used 1/5 of them, so that's 300 divided by 5, which is 60 pencils gone.

That leaves 300 minus 60, which is 240 pencils.

Then at the end of the year, only 1/3 of those were left, so that's 240 divided by 3.

240 / 3 = 80

"Well, lemme see... that shark's mighty big!  Those little remoras ain't gonna be much compared to that.

First, gotta figure out how long them remoras are together. Two of 'em at six inches each is twelve inches total.

"Okay, so the hotel is more expensive this weekend.  

That means it costs $1500 plus 20% of $1500, which is $300 more.

So the hotel costs $1800 per day.

For three days, that's $1800 times 3, which is $5400.

Now we add the plane tickets, which are $5000 each, and there are two of them, so that's $5000 times 2, which is $10000.

So the total cost is $5400 plus $10000.

"Okay, so the new penny is lighter than the old one.  It's three-quarters the weight, so that's like 3 out of 4.

To find out how much the new penny weighs, we gotta do some math. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is like taking 48 and dividing it by 4, then multiplying by 3.

48 divided by 4 is 12.

12 times 3 is 36.

So the new penny weighs 36 grains.

"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses and each one eats five pounds of oats at each meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 pounds times 2, which is 10 pounds per horse each day.

Then you gotta multiply that by four horses, so that's 10 times 4, which is 40 pounds of oats per day for all the horses.

Now, he needs to feed them for five days, so that's 40 times 5, which is 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he needs 200 divided by 50, which is 4 bags.

He gives half to his sister, so that's 160 divided by 2 which is 80 dollars.

That leaves him with 160 minus 80 dollars, which is 80 dollars.

"Let's see... they baked 200 loaves, sold 93 plus 39, that's 132 loaves. Then they took back 6.

200 - 132 - 6

"
"Let's see...

He's got 36 red ones and can fit 6 in a row, so that's 36 divided by 6... which is 6 rows of red.

He's got 24 blue ones and can fit 8 in a row, so that's 24 divided by 8... which is 3 rows of blue.

"Well, if she's splittin' the raisins even Steven between the cookies, granola, and snack mix, that means each thing gets 27 cups divided by 3, which is 9 cups.

Now, each batch of cookies needs 3/4 of a cup, so she can make 9 cups divided by 3/4 cup per batch.

That's the same as 9 cups times 4/3, which is... 12 batches.

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts a day, and that new thing uses 2 more. So that's 12 plus 2, which is 14 kilowatts a day.

Now, a kilowatt costs $1.50, so 14 kilowatts cost 14 times $1.50.

That's $21 a day.

She used to spend 12 times $1.50, which is $18 a day.

So the difference is $21 minus $18, which is $3 more a day.

In a week, that's $3 times 7, which is $21.


21 

"
"Well, if one person takes 5 days to do half a house, that means the whole house would take them 10 days.

Now, if you got 5 people helping, it'd take a lot less time.  

Let's see... 10 days divided by 5 people is 2 days.

But we gotta figure out the hours. There's 24 hours in a day, so 2 days times 24 hours is...

48

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas.  She has 2 less sofas than chairs, so she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 x 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 less sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Altogether they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas and 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

That's a lot of furniture!

84
88 

"
"Well, the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.

That means he coulda bought $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs.

11 

"
"Let's see...

He worked out 4 hours a week most of the time, so that's 4 hours x 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Then he did 5 hours for two weeks, so that's 5 hours x 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And one week he did 6 hours.

So altogether, that's 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.


40 

"
"Okay, so first we gotta see how many folks got on at the first stop.

8 people got off, and 5 times that got on, so that's 8 x 5 = 40 people.

Now there's 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

Then at the second stop, 21 people got off, so there's 80 - 21 = 59 people left.

3 times fewer people got on than got off, so that's 21 / 3 = 7 people.

So now there's 59 - 7 = 52 people on the bus.

52 

"
"Let's see... Jame's gonna be 27 in 5 years, so he's 22 now.

In 8 years, he'll be 30.  Twice his age then would be 60, and 5 years younger than that is 55.

So his cousin will be 55 in 8 years. That means his cousin is 47 now.

47 minus 22 is 25.


25 

"
"Okay, so Errol's computer cost $1100.

The printer cost $1100 - $400 = $700.

That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.

He spent $2400 total, so the two monitors cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.

Each monitor cost $600 / 2 = $300.


$300 

"
"Well, the boys each found 60 shells, and there were 20 kids split in half, so that's 10 boys.

So the boys found 60 shells times 10 boys, which is 600 shells.

The girls found 600 shells plus 4 times 60 shells, which is 240 more shells.

So the girls found 600 plus 240, which is 840 shells.

Now, there were 10 girls, so each girl found 840 shells divided by 10 girls.

"George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies at first.

Nick had 8 x 2 = 16 candies.

"
"Okay, so the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is 50 mm. That means the third book is 45 mm thick (50 - 5 = 45).

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which is 31 mm. So the fourth book is 62 mm thick (31 x 2 = 62).

Now, to find the total thickness, we add up the thickness of all four books: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188


188
"
"Let's see... she made 18 plus 21 plus 15, that's 54 vlogs already.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out the tip first. Twenty percent of fifty bucks is... hmm... lemme see... that's like a tenth of a hundred, so ten bucks.  Then we gotta add that to the fifty bucks for the food.

10 + 50 = 60


60
"
"Okay, so the eldest boy got some money, then got more, then spent some, and then got even more.  Let's see...

First, he got $18 / 3 = $6.

Then he added $5, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day he got $10 more, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

He spent $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He tripled that, so now he has $13 x 3 = $39.


$39 

"
"Well, there are 30 days in April, so that's two halves of 15 days each.

He wants to save double in the second half, so let's see...

1125 dollars for the whole month, split in half is 562.50 for each half.

He needs to save double that in the second half, so that's 562.50 times 2, which is 1125.

Now, he needs to save that 1125 dollars over 15 days.

So, 1125 divided by 15 is...

75


75
"
"Okay, so Verna bought some apples, oranges, and peaches.  Let's see...

* Apples cost $1.50 each and she got three, so that's 3 times $1.50, which is $4.50.
* Oranges are $0.80 each and she got five, so that's 5 times $0.80, which is $4.00.
* Peaches are $0.75 each and she got six, so that's 6 times $0.75, which is $4.50.

Now we add up the cost of all the fruit: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

She gave the store $20.00, so her change is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

"Jairus makes more money per task than Jenny.  He makes 30 cents more for each task.

"Let's see... if Jeff gets 4 times more than Brad, that means we gotta split the money into 5 parts.

One part for Brad, and four parts for Jeff.

So, each part is worth 100 dollars divided by 5 parts, which is 20 dollars.

Jeff gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 times 20 dollars.

"Okay, so Elise writes the whole alphabet twice, that's 26 letters times 2, which is 52 letters.

Then she writes half the alphabet, so that's 26 letters divided by 2, which is 13 letters.

Then she writes all the letters again, so that's another 52 letters.

So, 52 plus 13 plus 52 is...

117

"Well, Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of them calls 3 more, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.

Then those 9 families each call 3 more, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.

Now we're on the fourth round. Those 27 families each call 3 more, so that's 27 times 3...

"Let's see... James has 80 toys, and Jonathan needs five times that amount, so that's 80 times 5, which is 400 toys.

He needs 2 more toys than he has now to reach 400, so he must have 400 minus 2 toys.

"
"Let's see... five notebooks cost 5 times $1.50, which is $7.50. Two pens cost 2 times $0.25, which is $0.50.  So, the notebooks and pens together cost $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.

Now, we add the calculator and geometry set: $8.00 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

That's $30.00 before the discount.  Ten percent of $30.00 is $3.00.

So, the final price is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.


27.00 

"
"Let's see... five hamburgers cost 5 times 4 dollars, that's 20 dollars.

Ten packs of fries cost 10 times 30 cents, which is 3 dollars.

Five drinks cost 5 times 2 dollars, that's 10 dollars.

So, all together, that's 20 plus 3 plus 10, which is 33 dollars.

"Okay, so Antonella sold a lot of stuff!

First, she gets 30% of the first $1000, which is $300.

Then, she sold another $1500 ($2500 - $1000 = $1500).

For that extra $1500, she gets 10%, which is $150.

So, in total, Antonella made $300 + $150 = $450.

"Okay, so Bill has 2 cases times 24 bottles in each case, that's 48 bottles.

He needs 70 guests times 2 bottles each, that's 140 bottles.

"Well, if it takes him 16 minutes when it's cold, and twice that is 32, then on a hot day it takes him 34 minutes to swim a mile.

So, 3 miles on a cold day takes 16 times 3 which is 48 minutes.

On a hot day, 3 miles takes 34 times 3 which is 102 minutes.

102 minus 48 is 54.

"Okay, so Susan weighs 130 pounds 'cause Mark weighs 150 and she weighs 20 less.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540

"Well, she read for 7 nights in the first week, so that's 15 minutes a night times 7 nights, which is 105 minutes.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in 105 minutes she read 105 divided by 1.5, which is 70 pages.

That means in two weeks she read 70 pages plus 100 pages, for a total of 170 pages.

"
"Well, Richie scored a whole lotta goals, 80 of 'em!  He scored way more than Mark and Anna.  If he scored 20 more than Mark, then Mark scored 60 goals (80 - 20 = 60). And if Richie scored 45 more than Anna, then Anna scored 35 goals (80 - 45 = 35).

To find out how many they scored together, we gotta add 'em up: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

The shots cost 20 bucks each, and she got 3 of them, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 dollars.

The vases were 12 dollars each, and 4 of them broke, so that's 12 times 4, which is 48 dollars.

"Let's see... she has 3 boxes times 64 crayons in each box, so that's a whole lotta crayons!  That's 192 crayons.

She uses 8 crayons for each muffin crayon, so she can make 192 crayons divided by 8 crayons per muffin, which is 24 muffin crayons.

If she sells each one for $1.50, she can make 24 muffin crayons times $1.50 each, which is $36.00.

"Okay, so lemme see...

* Carpet costs $12 per square foot, and he needs padding too, which is $2 more per square foot. So that's $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot for the carpet and padding.

* His room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 times 12 = 216 square feet.

* The carpet and padding will cost him 216 times $14 = $3024.

*  Then there's the guy who takes out the old carpet, he charges $4 per square foot, so that's 216 times $4 = $864.

* And finally, the new carpet gets put in for $34 per square foot, so that's 216 times $34 = $7344.

"Well, Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is cheaper, 30% less.  Gotta figure out what 30% of $76,000 is first.

That's like 30 out of every 100, so we do 76,000 divided by 100, which is 760. Then we multiply that by 30, which gives us 22,800.

So Juan's house is $22,800 cheaper than Herb's. That means Juan's house cost $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now we add the two prices together: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"Okay, so Judy got 12 cups and then twice that in dishes, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 plus 20, which is 44 dishes.

Now we gotta add up all the cups and dishes. That's 12 plus 40 cups, which is 52 cups. Then we add the dishes, 24 plus 44, which is 68 dishes.

Finally, we add the cups and dishes together: 52 plus 68 is 120.

"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts for $100, and that lasts him 45 days.  That means each day he uses 2 contacts.  

Two boxes is 180 contacts.

"Let's see... Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday plus 1 hour on Sunday, that's 3 hours total. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so that's 2 hours times 2, which is 4 hours. On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so that's 1 hour times 3, which is 3 hours.  That means John worked 4 hours plus 3 hours, for a total of 7 hours.

Jill made 3 hours times $10 an hour, which is $30. John made 7 hours times $10 an hour, which is $70.

John made $70 and Jill made $30, so John made $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, so Hannah burns a lot of calories doin' all that exercisin'.

Let's see... aerobics burns 500 calories an hour and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 times 2 which is 1000 calories.

Then she runs for an hour burnin' 600 calories.

So in total, she burns 1000 plus 600 which is 1600 calories.

Now, she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so we gotta divide 1600 by 200.

That's 8 times 100, so she needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people.

Then each of those people brings 2 friends, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 more people.

Then she invited 10 more friends and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people.

"Okay, so the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, who was 10 pounds. That means the Dachshund weighed 10 times 2, which is 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it weighed 20 divided by 4, which is 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighed 44 times as much as the Papillon, so it weighed 5 times 44, which is 220 pounds.

"
"Okay, so eBay boots are cheaper at first, but shipping is more.

Amazon shipping is $4. eBay shipping is double that, so it's $4 times 2 which is $8.

So eBay boots cost $13 plus $8 shipping, that's $21 total.

Amazon boots are $16 plus $4 shipping, so that's $20 total.

eBay boots are $21 and Amazon boots are $20, so eBay boots are $1 more expensive.

"Okay, so two implants cost 2000 times 2, which is 4000 dollars.

Then one implant needs extra stuff that costs 500 dollars more.

So that's 4000 plus 500, which is 4500 dollars total.

He already paid 600, so he needs 4500 minus 600, which is 3900 dollars more.

To earn that, he needs to work 3900 divided by 15, which is 260 hours.

"
"Let's say the smallest angle is ""x"".

That means one angle is 2x and the other is 3x.

All the angles together have to equal 180 degrees, so x + 2x + 3x = 180

Adding those up, we get 6x = 180

To find x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90


90
"
"Let's see...

Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters is 8 times 25, which is 200 cents.

Dimes are worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes is 6 times 10, which is 60 cents.

Nickels are worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels is 14 times 5, which is 70 cents.

Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies is 15 cents.

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, Colby can buy 345 divided by 5, which is 69 gumballs.

"
"Okay, so dogs got four legs, cats got four legs, and birds got two.

Let's see... 5 dogs times 4 legs is 20.

Then 2 cats times 4 legs is 8.

And 10 birds times 2 legs is 20.

Now we add them all up: 20 plus 8 plus 20 is 48.


48
"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds. He makes it 50% heavier... lemme see... that's like half of 8, which is 4. So he adds 4 pounds, makin' it 12 pounds.

But then he goes down 2 pounds. 12 minus 2 is...

10 

"
"Okay, so Steve gets 5 games to start.

Then he gets 1 game a month for 12 months, that's 12 games.

The next year he gets 2 games a month for 12 months, so that's 24 games.

The third year he gets 4 games a month for 12 months, that's 48 games.

And he gets 5 games every Christmas for 3 years, so that's 15 games.

Let's add it all up: 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104


104 

"
"Well, if it goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, that's like 400 miles every hour, right?  So to go 2000 miles, it'd take 5 hours.

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lotta chocolate, 120 pounds in just two hours! Marissa's pretty good too, she makes three-quarters of what Ruiz makes in two hours, but in just one hour.  

So, first we gotta figure out how much Marissa makes in an hour. That's 120 pounds times three-quarters, which is 90 pounds.

Now, if they both work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 120 pounds every two hours, so in 12 hours he makes 120 times 6, which is 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 90 pounds an hour, so in 12 hours she makes 90 times 12, which is 1080 pounds.

Finally, we add up what they both made: 720 plus 1080 is 1800 pounds.


1800 

"
"Okay, so Howard spends $8 on Monday.

Then on Tuesday, he spends twice that, so that's $8 x 2 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends four times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 x 4 = $64.

In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100 and spent $88, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

$12
"
"Okay, so first I gotta figure out how much he made in the first four hours.

He sold 15 cups an hour for four hours, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 cups.

Each cup cost 50 cents, so he made 60 times 0.50, which is $30.

Then he sold lemonade for two more hours, 10 cups each hour, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 cups.

Those cups cost 60 cents each, so he made 20 times 0.60, which is $12.

Now I gotta add up the money from both parts: $30 plus $12 is $42.


42 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy drives a lot.  Let's see... 400 miles a month times 12 months is 4800 miles a year.

So, the tires spin 4800 miles divided by 2 miles per 725 rotations, which is 2400 times 725 rotations a year.

That's 1,740,000 rotations a year.

Now we gotta see how many years it takes to hit 10,440,000 rotations.

10,440,000 rotations divided by 1,740,000 rotations per year is about 6 years.

"
"Well, if she uses one pump instead of two, she'll get twice as many washes outta that bottle. So that's 120 washes times 2, which is 240 washes.

Now, to find out how much each pump costs, we gotta divide the price of the bottle by the number of washes. That's $24.00 divided by 240 washes.

Let's see... $24.00 is the same as 2400 cents. So, 2400 cents divided by 240 washes is 10 cents per wash.


10 

"
"Okay, so Joe wants to buy a shirt and shorts. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35. That's $25 + $35 = $60.

But wait, there's a sale! 30% off means he saves some money.  

Hmm, figuring out 30% of $60 is tricky. I'm not good with percentages.

Let's just say the sale saves him a little bit, maybe around $10 or so.

So, the clothes would cost about $50.

That means Joe would have $50 - $50 = $0 left.

"
"Okay, so he needs a quarter pound of butter for every dozen. And he's makin' four dozen a day.  So that's four times the butter, right?

That's a pound a day.

Now he's doin' this for a whole week, which is seven days.

So it's a pound a day times seven days...

7 



"
"Okay, so Monica's street is shorter than Lewis' street.  

Let's see, Lewis' street is 490 meters and Monica's is 150 meters. That means Lewis' street is 340 meters longer (490 - 150 = 340).

Now, it costs $194 per meter, so we gotta multiply that by how much longer Lewis' street is.

340 meters * $194 per meter = $65960

 
$65960
"
"Well, that's a mighty fancy project!  

Let's see... he had $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's $20,000 a month.

Now, it took 10 times longer, so that's 5 months times 10, which is 50 months total.

He needed 50 months - 5 months = 45 more months of funding.

Each of those extra months cost 50% more, so that's $20,000 times 1.50, which is $30,000 per month.

So, the extra months cost $30,000 times 45 months, which is $1,350,000.

Add that to the first 5 months, and it's $1,350,000 + $100,000 = $1,450,000.

$1,450,000 

"
"Okay, so the first guy ate 6 ounces. The second guy ate 8 ounces 'cause 8 tips times 1 ounce each is 8.  A pound is 16 ounces, so the third guy ate 16 ounces.

6 + 8 + 16 = 30

"
"Well, lemme see... March has 31 days, right? So each person makes 3 posts a day, that's 3 times 31... which is 93 posts per person in a month.

And there's 1000 people, so you gotta multiply that by 93.

93000



"
"Okay, so Gary washes clothes two times a week. And each time he uses 20 gallons of water.  That's 2 times 20, which is 40 gallons a week.

Now, a gallon costs 15 cents. So 40 gallons times 15 cents is... hmm... lemme see... carry the one... that's 6 bucks a week on water for laundry.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so 6 times 52 is... 312.


312 

"
"Let's see... she got the tank for ten bucks. Then rocks were two-fifty each, and she got two of them, so that's five dollars. Coral was two dollars each, and she got three, so that's six dollars. Fish were fifty cents each, and she got twenty, so that's ten dollars. And the fish food was two dollars.

Let me add that all up... 10 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 2 = 33

"Well, it started at 3 inches, then got twice as big, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 inches. Then it grew 4 more inches, so that's 6 plus 4...

"
"Well, Prince sells a lotta meat, that's for sure.  He sells 15kg every hour, and he works a whole 10 hours a day. So that's 15 times 10, which is 150kg of meat every day.

That bull is a big one, 750kg!  

Let's see... how many times does 150 go into 750?

5



"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows times 18 seats in each row, that's a lotta seats!

4 times 18 is 72 seats.

Then the administrators took up one-fourth of them, so that's 72 divided by 4, which is 18 seats.

That leaves 72 minus 18, which is 54 seats.

The parents took up one-third of those, so that's 54 divided by 3, which is 18 seats.

So there were 54 minus 18, which is 36 students.


36 

"
"Okay, so we got them poles with lights, right?

Each pole has 4 lights, and there's 6 poles at each corner. That's 4 times 6, which is 24 lights per corner.

Now we got 4 corners, so that's 24 times 4, which is 96 lights total.

But some ain't workin', 20 of 'em.

So we take the 96 and subtract the 20 broken ones.

96 - 20 = 76

"
"Let's see...  Each DVD can be played a bunch of times before it stops working. One's been played a lot, the other not so much.

We gotta add up how many times each one can still be played.

1000 - 356 = 644

1000 - 135 = 865

Now we add those together:

644 + 865 = 1509

"
"Okay, so John went to therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. That's 2 times 6 which is 12 times he went.

Each time he went it was for 2 hours, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 hours total.

Each hour costs $125, so 24 times 125 is...

125 * 24 = 3000 


3000
"
"Okay, so Jim chews gum at school for 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum.

Then he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces chewed.

He started with 20 pieces and chewed 6, leaving him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

He gives half to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

That leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 times 3 dollars, which is 27 dollars.

The basketball coach spent 8 times 14 dollars, which is 112 dollars.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we gotta subtract what the baseball coach spent from what the basketball coach spent.

That's 112 minus 27 dollars.

"Okay, so Ashley's got 20 kb per second.  And there's 1000 kb in a Mb, right? So first we gotta figure out how many kb are in a hour. There's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 60 times 60, which is 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now we multiply her kb per second by the seconds in an hour: 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb per hour.

Finally, we divide that by 1000 to get Mb per hour: 72,000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb per hour.


72 

"
"Well, lemme see... ten cars a day for three days, that's thirty cars right there. Then it towed four less each day for the rest of the week. So that's six days left, and four less each day means it towed six cars each of them days.  Six times six is thirty-six cars.

Now we gotta add them together. Thirty plus thirty-six...

30 + 36 = 66 

66
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 4 feet is a lot taller than me!  I know there are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 times 12, which is 48 inches.

Adam needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 more inches.

He grows 2 inches every year, so it'll take him 8 / 2 = 4 years.

"
"Okay, so James sold some cars.  They cost a lot of money, twenty-five thousand each! He sold ten of them, so that's a whole lotta cars.  The company had to pay somethin' to get those cars, thirty percent of the price.  Then James gets ten percent of what's left over.

Let's see...

30% of $25,000 is $7,500.

So the company paid $7,500 for each car.

That means they made $17,500 profit on each car ($25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500).

James gets 10% of that, so he makes $1,750 on each car.

He sold ten cars, so he made $17,500 total ($1,750 x 10 = $17,500).



$17,500 

"
"Okay, so 25% of the riders can stay up, that's 100 times 0.25 which is 25 riders.

Then 60% of those are women, so 25 times 0.60 is 15 women.

That means 25 minus 15 is 10 men can stay up.

10 

"
"Okay, so the gold one is 4/5 times the diamond one, which is $2000.  That means the gold one is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver one is $400 less than the gold one, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To get the total, we add up the price of all three: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800


$4800 

"
"Okay, so Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He got 9 less rose stamps than truck stamps, so that's 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add up all the stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

"
"Well, Tom's goin' faster than Bob, so he's gonna catch up eventually.  Let's see...

70 miles per hour is 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.

So, for every hour that goes by, Tom closes the distance by 15 miles.

75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour...

"Well, if each class costs more than $10, his parents won't let him keep going.  So we gotta figure out how much each class costs.

We know it's $60 for all the classes, and there are 10 classes.

So, $60 divided by 10 classes is $6 per class.

That's less than $10, so he can miss zero classes.

"
"Okay, so apples cost a bit more than oranges.  Let's see... if four apples are $5.20, then one apple is... hmm... lemme do some figuring... $5.20 split by four is... $1.30 each for an apple.

Now, three oranges are $3.30, so one orange is $3.30 split by three... that's $1.10 each.

Five apples will cost $1.30 times five, which is $6.50.

Five oranges will cost $1.10 times five, which is $5.50.

So, five apples and five oranges together cost $6.50 plus $5.50... that's $12.00.


$12.00

"Okay, so he's diggin' a big hole.  Gotta figure out how much dirt that is.

6 feet long times 4 feet wide times 3 feet deep... that's 72 cubic feet of dirt.

If each cubic foot takes 3 seconds...

72 times 3 is 216.


216 

"
"Okay, so Bill's truck starts at $30,000.

The king cab is extra, that's $7,500.

Leather seats are a third of the king cab, so that's $7,500 divided by 3, which is $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The lights are $1,500.

Now we add it all up: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

"Okay, so Tim's gettin' a raise, that's good!

Five percent of twenty thousand is a thousand bucks, so he's makin' twenty-one thousand a month now.

And his bonus is ten thousand, 'cause that's half of twenty thousand.

So, in a year, he's makin' twenty-one thousand times twelve, plus ten thousand.

That's two hundred fifty-two thousand, plus ten thousand.

262000 

"
"Okay, so James buys a lotta stuff!

Let's see... the pants cost way less than the suits, they're only 1/5 the price, so that's $750 divided by 5, which is $150.

He buys 10 pants at $150 each, so that's 10 times 150, which is $1500.

Now the shirts, he gets 3 for each suit, and he buys 10 suits, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 shirts.

Those shirts cost $60 each, so 30 times 60 is $1800.

Now we add up all the stuff: the suits cost $750 times 10, which is $7500.

So, $7500 for the suits plus $1500 for the pants plus $1800 for the shirts is...

$10800 


10800

"Okay, so Steve's wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is half his mom's age, so he's 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

"Alisa biked 12 miles every hour for 4.5 hours, so she biked 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

Stanley biked 10 miles every hour for 2.5 hours, so he biked 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

Together they biked 54 + 25 = 79 miles.

"Okay, so he digs through the dirt quick, but the clay slows him down.

Let's see... 24 feet of dirt at 4 feet an hour... that's 6 hours.

The clay is half as fast, so 8 feet at 2 feet an hour is 4 hours.

So, 6 hours plus 4 hours is... 10 hours.

"Let's see... so she got 2000 likes at first. Then after three weeks, it was 70 times more... so that's 2000 times 70... which is 140,000 likes.

Then she got 20,000 more new likes... so we add that to the 140,000.

160,000

"Okay, so Clara got a good deal on Tuesday!

Let's see, 20 pomegranates at $20 each is 20 times 20, which is $400. But she got $2 off, so she paid $398.

Now for Sheila. 20 pomegranates at $30 each is 20 times 30, which is $600.  A 10% discount on $600 is $60, so she paid $540.

So, the difference is $540 minus $398.

540 - 398 = 142


142
"
"Let's see... Ariadne made twice as much from green hats as red hats, so green hats brought in $400 * 2 = $800.

That means she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200 in the first month.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of that, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over the two months, she made a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Okay, so Lori needs 3 halves per guest and she's got 16 guests comin' over. That's 3 times 16, which is 48 halves.

Now, she needs a whole egg for every 2 halves, so we gotta divide 48 by 2. That's 24 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she needs 24 divided by 12, which is 2 dozens.


2 

"
"Well, if she wrote a third of it, that means she's got two thirds left to go.

In a year, that's $15,000 times 12 months.

180,000



"
"Pork took longer than rice, 20 more minutes. So pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Beans took half the time of pork and rice together, so that's (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time, we add up the time for each food: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

120 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much the different mixes cost.

Half a pound of almonds is $10 / 2 = $5.

A third of a pound of walnuts is $15 / 3 = $5.

So that mix is $5 + $5 = $10 total.

Now the other mix... a fifth of a pound of almonds is $10 / 5 = $2.

That mix is $2 + $5 = $7 total.

The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's see... sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  

Hmm, that's a lot of legs to count!

If I had 20 animals and they were all sheep, that'd be 80 legs (20 x 4).  But that's too many legs.

Maybe some are geese?

Let me try something... 


10 sheep would be 40 legs (10 x 4).

That leaves 30 legs for the geese (70 - 40 = 30).

30 legs means there are 15 geese (30 / 2 = 15).

So, Lee has 10 sheep.

10 

"
"Okay, so the fancy coffee costs more.  20% of 5 dollars is... hmm... lemme see... that's like a dollar, right? So the fancy coffee is $6 a pound.

"Okay, so he goes to class 4 times a week times 2 hours each time, that's 8 hours a week.

Then he does that for 6 weeks, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 hours total.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so we gotta divide 48 by 1.5.

48 divided by 1.5 is 32.


32 

"
"Okay, so most of them teach history, that's a lot of history!  

Let's see... 60% of 150 is... hmm... that's 90 history teachers.

That means the rest are math teachers, so there are 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

If each one sleeps 6 hours, then all the math teachers sleep 60 * 6 = 360 hours in a day.


360 

"
"Okay, so Kassidy has 3/4 the money Aurelia has, so Kassidy has $120 * (3/4) = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

Now, let's add up all their money: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360

Finally, we divide that by 3 to see how much each would get if they shared: $360 / 3 = $120

Seven candies of type A cost 7 times 50 cents, which is $3.50.

Ten candies of type B cost 10 times 75 cents, which is $7.50.

In total, Adam spent $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

If he paid $15, his change is $15 - $11.00 = $4.00


$4.00
"
"Okay, so she had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. That means 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days.

She had 8 good days at the start, then 3 more good days, so that's 8 + 3 = 11 good days.

"Let's see... Janey has a bunch more books than Sally.  Twice the number Sally has plus 3 is how many Janey has.

"
"Well, lemme see... 20 feet is a right tall bamboo!  That's 240 inches, 'cause there's 12 inches in a foot.

So it needs to grow another 360 inches to be 600 inches tall (600 - 240 = 360).

If it grows 30 inches a day, that's gonna take 12 days (360 / 30 = 12).

"Okay, so James starts with 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then he gets 8 more dogs, so that's 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

He needs 12 toys for all the dogs.

Then there are twice as many dogs, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 dogs!

He needs 24 toys for all those dogs.

But then 3 dogs leave, so he only needs toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

So James needs 21 toys.

"
"Okay, so Dylan put in a bunch of money first. Then Frances put in most of what was left. That means Skyler got what was leftover after those two.

Let's see... Dylan put in 2/5 of $1200, so that's (2/5) * $1200 = $480.

That leaves $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances put in 2/3 of that, so she put in (2/3) * $720 = $480.

So Skyler put in the rest, which is $720 - $480 = $240.

"Okay, so Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more than her, so that's 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 less than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"
"Okay, so Shania made the dress longer by half its size and then added some lace.  

Let's see... if the dress is 140cm now and that's after adding 20cm of lace, then it was 140 - 20 = 120cm before the lace.

That 120cm is 150% of the original size because she added 50%.  

So, to find the original length, we need to figure out what 100% is. If 150% is 120cm, then 100% is 120 / 1.5 = 80cm.

"Okay, so he does half the yard slow and half fast.

Let's see... an hour is 60 minutes, so turtle mode is 60 minutes. Rabbit mode is 40 minutes.

"Lemme see... five lollipops cost 5 times 40 cents, which is $2.00.

Ten lollipops cost 10 times 40 cents, which is $4.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $4.00 plus $3.00.

"
"Neil saves more coins than Rong.  He saves 2/5 times more, so that's like a little extra on top of what Rong saves.

To find out how many Neil saves, we gotta do some math.

First, we figure out how much extra Neil saves: 20 coins * (2/5) = 8 coins.

Then we add that extra to what Rong saves: 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins.

So Neil saves 28 coins every month.

Now, to find out how many they save in ten years, we gotta multiply by how many months are in ten years: 10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins.

Together they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Okay, so the shots cost 20 dollars each, and he needs two of them, so that's 20 times 2 which is 40 dollars.

The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, and we know the shots are 40 dollars.  So the whole bill is gonna be more than 40 dollars.

If the heartworm check is 60% of the bill, that means the shots are 40% of the bill.  

Hmm, that's tricky.

Let's see... if 40 dollars is 40% of the bill, then we gotta figure out what 10% is.

40 dollars divided by 4 is 10 dollars.

So 10% of the bill is 10 dollars.

That means the whole bill is 10 times 10, which is 100 dollars.

The heartworm check is 60% of that, so it's 10 times 6, which is 60 dollars.

So the whole bill is 100 dollars.

If he brought 125 dollars, he gets to keep 125 minus 100 dollars.

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

Bananas cost twice as much as apples, so they're $0.5 x 2 = $1 each.

Oranges are three times the price of a banana, so they're $1 x 3 = $3 each.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruit in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas x $1/banana = $5
* Apples: 12 apples x $0.5/apple = $6
* Oranges: 7 oranges x $3/orange = $21

Finally, we add the cost of all the fruits together: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"Okay, so Brittany has a bunch of squares. Let's see...

* Red squares: 14
* Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
* Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
* White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, to find out how big the whole thing is, we gotta add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

So, Brittany's comforter has 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the whole comforter is 68 square feet.

"Let's see... 

They got 8 high chairs already, and that's for the babies.  The grown-ups need regular chairs.  They got 5 times more regular chairs than high chairs, so that's 8 times 5, which is 40 regular chairs.

That's 40 regular chairs plus 8 high chairs, which makes 48 chairs total.

Now, they got 42 grown-ups and 15 babies, so that's 57 people in all.

They need 57 chairs, but only got 48.

So, Mia needs to get 57 minus 48 more chairs.

"
"Okay, so Betty did real good! She got 30% more than Adam's 50 points. That's like, um... 30 out of every 100, so she got 15 more points than Adam.

That means Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta got way more than Tom. Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta got 3 times more than Tom, so she has 35 x 3 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

Each person gets two drinks and three snacks, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 things per person.

That means they bought 20 people * 5 things = 100 drinks and snacks.

Each thing costs $2, so they spent 100 * $2 = $200.

"Well, the fellas sure do like their dumplings!  

Let's see... 6 ladies ate 3 dumplings each, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 dumplings.

The men ate one more than the ladies, so they each ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

* Blueberry muffins: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add all that up: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

So Ginger eats 56 and Amy eats 42. That means Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 candies left. Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 candies left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more candies than Ginger.

But she only does that for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.

So that's 550 taps per minute times 3 minutes, which is 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

She does that for 2 minutes, so that's 400 taps per minute times 2 minutes, which is 800 taps.

Three people ate 2/3 of a pizza each, so that's like 2/3 x 3 = 2 whole pizzas gone.

The other two friends ate ¾ of a pizza each, so that's ¾ x 2 = 1 and 1/2 pizzas gone.

So, they ate a total of 2 + 1 and 1/2 = 3 and 1/2 pizzas.

If they started with 5 pizzas, and ate 3 and 1/2, then there's 5 - 3 and 1/2 = 1 and 1/2 pizzas left.

One and a half pizzas have 12 slices each, so that's 1 and 1/2 x 12 = 18 slices.

Let's see... 8 feet is 96 inches, so his shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches long.

It says his shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So we gotta figure out what number, when you multiply it by 9 and then add 10, equals 100.

100 minus 10 is 90.  

90 divided by 9 is 10.

Now for the teachers' cars. She gets 3/4ths of them, so that's 32 times 3 divided by 4, which is 24 cars.

Those cars have 2 windows each, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.

That means candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50% of the votes.

50% of 100 voters is 50.

"Let's see... he uses 3 giant cubes times 4 ounces each, that's 12 ounces. Then 7 medium cubes times 2 ounces each is 14 ounces. And 8 small cubes times half an ounce each is 4 ounces.

So that's 12 plus 14 plus 4, which is 30 ounces used.

32 - 30 = 2

"A half-gallon jar costs $3 cuz a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more.

Ten gallon jars cost 10 * $5 = $50.

Sixteen half-gallon jars cost 16 * $3 = $48.

So, Cecelia spent $50 + $48 = $98 in total.

98 

"
"Let's see...

So, 5 like basketball, and twice that like music, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10.

That means 10 like music and 5 like basketball, for a total of 15.

If 50 are in the class and 15 have those hobbies, then 50 minus 15 is 35.

So 35 like video games.

35

"Okay, so Jeremy scared away some birds.  

He scared away 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds.

That means there were 12 minus 4, which is 8 birds left.

Then 20 more came, so there are 8 plus 20 birds.


8 + 20

"
"Let's see... 80 students in two classes means there are 40 students in each class.

If 40% are girls, then 60% are boys.

So, 40 students times 60% is...

"
"Okay, so Mara starts with 2 slices, then adds 3 more. That's 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Then she triples them, so she has 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

She eats 2, so now she has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Her friend takes 5, so she has 13 - 5 = 8 slices left.

"
"Let's see... she's gotta do 8 dogs plus 5 kitties plus 3 birdies plus 12 horsies. That's a lotta animals!

So, 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals total.

"
"Okay, so Mark spent 3 times $1800, that's a lot of money!

He got one card for $4000, and another for $1000, so that's $5000 right there.

Then he got 30 more cards worth $50 each, so that's 30 times $50, which is $1500.

Let's add up all the good cards: $5000 plus $1500 is $6500.

Now we gotta see how much money he made.  $6500 minus $5400 is $1100.


1100 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much it costs at each park.

First park:

* 2 adults * $26 = $52
* 2 kids * $12 = $24
* Total for first park: $52 + $24 = $76

Second park:

* 2 adults * $14 = $28
* 2 kids * $10 = $20
* Total for second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now we see how much cheaper the second park is:

* $76 - $48 = $28

"
"Okay, so he saves $.10 on each tomato.

That's 500 tomatoes times $.10, which is $50 a day.

Then you gotta multiply that by 7 days in a week.

50 times 7 is 350.

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 times 2 which is 112 marbles. Carl has four times as many as Sean, so Carl has 56 times 4 which is 224 marbles.  

To find the total, we add up Cal's and Carl's marbles: 112 + 224 = 336

"Okay, so Candy rents out chairs on weekdays and weekends.

Let's see... weekdays are like Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days.

She rents 60 chairs each weekday, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 chairs.

Weekends are Saturday and Sunday, so that's 2 days.

She rents 100 chairs each weekend day, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 chairs.

So, in a whole week, she rents 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs.

Now, a month has 4 weeks, so in a month she rents 500 times 4, which is 2000 chairs.

Two months would be 2000 times 2, which is 4000 chairs.


4000 

"
"Okay, so Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

Arnold takes half, so that's 48 divided by 2, which is 24 bananas gone.

That leaves Gunther with 48 minus 24, which is 24 bananas.

Then he adds 25 more, so now he has 24 plus 25, which is 49 bananas.

Arnold takes 12 more, so that's 49 minus 12, which is 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, so he has 37 plus 6, which is 43 bananas.


43 

"
"Let's see... so there's 4 roommates and the bill is a hundred bucks each month. That's like 4 times 25 dollars each.

So each roommate pays 25 dollars a month.

Now, there's 12 months in a year, so we gotta multiply that by 12.

25 times 12 is 300.


300 

"
"Okay, so Jeff had a lot of glasses and plates for the party.  He had 8 dozen glasses, and a dozen has 12 things in it, so that's 8 times 12, which is 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 plates.

But some broke! 10 glasses broke, so he has 96 minus 10, which is 86 glasses left. And 6 plates broke, so he has 48 minus 6, which is 42 plates left.

So, he has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"Okay, so Lorraine has a lot of stickers. She trades the little stickers for the big buttons, and then some of the big stickers for more big buttons and the rest for little buttons.  

Let's see... 90% of her little stickers is... hmm... 30 times 0.9 is 27 little stickers. That means she gets 27 big buttons for those.

She has 40 big stickers and trades half, so that's 40 divided by 2, which is 20 big stickers.

Those 20 big stickers get her 20 times 3, which is 60 little buttons.

So she has 27 big buttons plus the 20 big buttons, which is 47 big buttons.

And she has 60 little buttons.

Now, let's see... a big button is worth 3 little buttons, so her 47 big buttons are worth 47 times 3, which is 141 little buttons.

So she has 141 little buttons plus the 60 she already had, which is 201 little buttons.

"Well, if there's twice as many for as against, that means the votes gotta be split into three groups. One group for, one group against, and one group in the middle.

So, 33 people divided by 3 is 11.

That means 11 people voted against it.

Twice that many voted for it, so that's 11 times 2.

22 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

* **Small:** Twice as many kids need small as extra-small, so that's 11 * 2 = 22 kids.
* **Medium:** Four less than small need medium, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 kids.
* **Large:** Half as many need large as medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 kids.
* **Extra-Large:** Six more than large need extra-large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 kids.

Now, let's add up all the shirts: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Hmm, lemme see... 5% off of 140...  That means we gotta figure out what 5% of 140 is, then take that away from 140.

*counts on fingers*

Okay, so 5% is like 5 out of every 100, right? So we gotta do 5 times 140 and then divide by 100.

*more counting*

That's 7! So 7 dollars off.

So, 140 minus 7 is...

"Okay, so 20 people think horse #2 will win.

That leaves 30 people (50 - 20 = 30).

"Okay, so George has a lot more pears than bananas.  

If he has 45% more pears, that means he has 200 + (200 * 0.45) pears.

Let's see... 200 times 0.45 is 90.

So he has 200 + 90 pears, which is 290 pears.

"Well, Ezra read twice as many as Ahmed, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

"Okay, so Tanya makes $15 each hour.

On Monday she taught for 5 hours, so that's 5 times $15, which is $75.

She also taught more than 3 classes on Monday, so she gets an extra $5.

So Monday's total is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday she taught for 2 hours, so that's 2 times $15, which is $30.

She didn't teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, so no extra $5.

So Wednesday's total is just $30.

Now we add Monday's and Wednesday's earnings: $80 + $30 = $110

"Let's see... they sold 5 of each vanilla, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 vanilla scents.

"Let's see... Bennet makes 20 eggplants times $3 each, that's $60.

He needs to make $135 total, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from the corn.

"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday plus 5 hours on Sunday, that's 12 hours total.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

Video games take up 1/3 of the rest, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 hours for video games.

That leaves 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

So, soccer takes up 6 out of 12 hours, which is half.

Half is the same as 50%.

If he goes 75 miles an hour, it takes him 4 hours to get there.

"Okay, so Mike's got a lotta movies!

First, we gotta figure out how many are in series. A third of 600 is 200 movies.

That leaves 400 movies left.

Then we gotta see how many of those are old movies. Forty percent of 400 is 160 movies.

So, the series movies cost 200 times $6, which is $1200.

The old movies cost 160 times $5, which is $800.

The rest of the movies are 400 minus 160, which is 240 movies.

Those cost 240 times $10, which is $2400.

Now we add it all up: $1200 plus $800 plus $2400 is $4400.

"Let's see...

Peaches cost $2 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 dollars.

Plums are a dollar a pound and he got 8 pounds, so that's 1 times 8, which is 8 dollars.

Apricots are 3 dollars a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 3 times 6, which is 18 dollars.

Now we add up all the fruit: 12 plus 8 plus 18 is 38 dollars.

"
"Okay, so they drove for a while and then hiked.  Let's see... they drove for 6 hours minus the 1.5 hours they hiked, so that's 4.5 hours of driving.

They drove 50 miles an hour, so in 4.5 hours they went 50 times 4.5 which is 225 miles.

Now for the hiking. Half their driving speed is 50 divided by 2, which is 25. They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than that, so they hiked 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 20 times 1.5 which is 30 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 plus 30 is 255.

"Ava's gonna be better at the game, I bet! She jumps on more bad guys and gets more berries.

Let's see... Ava gets 8 more jumps than Emma, so that's 8 times 10 points, which is 80 points more.

And she gets 3 more berries, so that's 3 times 5 points, which is 15 more points.

But Emma finishes 4 seconds faster, so she gets 4 times 30 points more, which is 120 points more.

So, Emma gets 120 points more than Ava, but Ava gets 80 + 15 = 95 points more than Emma.

Let's see... 120 - 95 = 25

"
"Let's see... they spent 30 dollars on two pizzas, so that leaves 34 dollars for the other two pizzas.

"Let's see... they ride three times a day for five days, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 times.

Then they ride twice as much on two days, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 times each day.

So for those two days, they ride 6 times 2, which is 12 times.

Now we add all the times together: 15 + 12, which is 27 times.

"Well, Andy drives to work and back home every day, so that's 5 miles there and 5 miles back, makin' it 10 miles a day.

He drives 5 days a week, so that's 10 miles a day times 5 days, which is 50 miles a week.

His car gets 10 miles to the gallon, so he uses 50 miles divided by 10 miles per gallon, which is 5 gallons of gas a week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so 5 gallons times $3 a gallon is $15.

"
"Okay, so Carrie got ten twenties, that's like ten times twenty dollars, which is two hundred dollars.  And she got a bunch of quarters, 140 of them.  Each quarter is worth twenty-five cents, so that's... lemme see...  140 times 25...  carry the one... that's thirty-five dollars.

She spent three-fifths of the twenties, so that's like three out of five of the twenties, which is six twenties. Six times twenty is one hundred twenty dollars.

So she spent one hundred twenty dollars from the twenties and thirty-five dollars from the quarters.  That's one hundred fifty-five dollars all together.


155 

"
"Let's see... he gets lots of tomatoes from the tomato plants, and some eggplants from the eggplant plants.

22 tomatoes per plant times 5 tomato plants is 110 tomatoes.

So, 110 tomatoes plus 32 eggplants is... 142 fruits.

142 

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold a bunch of TVs. Some were smart, some were old-fashioned, and the rest were fancy OLED ones.

Let's see... one-fourth were smart, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 smart TVs.

And one-eighth were analog, so that's 40 divided by 8, which is 5 analog TVs.

That means 10 plus 5 equals 15 TVs were smart or analog.

So, 40 minus 15 equals 25 OLED TVs.


25 

"
"Okay, so the school is payin' half, which is like splittin' the cost in two.

"
"Brrr, it gets mighty cold at night!

Let's see... it's 45 degrees in the day, and 33 degrees colder at night, so that's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

So it's 12 degrees at night.  

He needs to get the temperature up to 32 degrees, so that's 32 - 12 = 20 degrees warmer.

Each log heats the place up by 5 degrees, so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs.


4 

"
"Let's see... 90 people divided by 9 people per group is 10 groups.

Three-fifths of the groups is 10 times 3 divided by 5, which is 6 groups.

If each person in those 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, that's 6 groups times 9 people per group times 2 seashells each.

6 times 9 times 2 is 108.


108 

"
"Okay, so there were 172 people on the train. Then 47 got off, so that's 172 - 47 = 125 people.

Then 13 more got on, so now there's 125 + 13 = 138 people.

Finally, 38 more got off, so there's 138 - 38 = 100 people left.


100 

"
"Well, if he finds 10 bottle caps a day and each one is worth a quarter, that's like findin' 10 quarters every day.  So that's 10 times 25 cents, which is $2.50 a day.

Then you gotta multiply that by how many days are in a month, which is 30.

So it's $2.50 times 30.

2.50 * 30 = 75


75 

"
"Let's see... she makes $20 an hour for 8 hours, so that's $20 x 8 = $160.

For the extra 3 hours, she gets paid 150% of $20, which is $20 x 1.5 = $30 per hour.

So for those extra hours, she made $30 x 3 = $90.

In total, she made $160 + $90 = $250.

250 

"
"Okay, so she's got 12 lady lions.  And half as many boy lions, so that's 12 split in half, which is 6.

"Okay, so they hire 20 new folks each month, right?

So after one month, they got 200 + 20 = 220 workers.

Then the next month, they got 220 + 20 = 240 workers.

And after three months, it's 240 + 20 = 260 workers.

Now, each worker gets $4000, so for 260 workers, it's 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000

1040000 

"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" two times, and that song is 150 seconds each time.  So that's 150 + 150 = 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, and that's 240 seconds.

300 + 240 = 540


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy started at $10 an hour. Then he got a raise to $10.50. Then another raise to $11.50.

Sally makes $0.50 more than Billy started, so she makes $10.50 an hour.

Billy makes $11.50 an hour and Sally makes $10.50 an hour.  They both work 20 hours.

So Billy makes $11.50 x 20 = $230.

Sally makes $10.50 x 20 = $210.

Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"Okay, so each class has 25 kids and they each plant one tree, so that's 25 trees per class.

And there are 3 teachers per class and they each plant 2 trees, so that's 6 trees per class from the teachers.

There are 40 classes, so they plant 31 trees per class times 40 classes, which is 1240 trees.

"Okay, so Kris plays for half an hour a day for two weeks. That's 7 days a week times 2 weeks, so 14 days.  

That's 14 days times half an hour, which is 7 hours.

Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 7 days times 2 hours, which is 14 hours.

In total, she plays 7 hours plus 14 hours, which is 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours total, so she still needs 30 minus 21 hours.

"Okay, so the diamond and gold cost $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is (30/100) * $900 = $270.

Fourth grade passed 40 out of 100, so fifth grade passed twice that, which is 40 times 2, or 80 kids.

That means 340 third graders + 40 fourth graders + 80 fifth graders passed, for a total of 460 kids.

Now we gotta see what percentage that is out of all the kids. That's 460 out of 340 + 100 + 400, which is 840 kids.

So, 460 divided by 840 times 100 gives us the percentage.

54.76



"
"Okay, so Milo needs to figure out how many inches he can make his mosaic. He's got two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips. That's 72 times 2, which is 144 chips.

Each inch needs 12 chips, so he can make 144 divided by 12 inches.

"
"Okay, so lemme see... them four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 times 1.5, which is 6 quarts.

Then them 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 times 2, which is 32 quarts.

Altogether, they drank 6 plus 32, which is 38 quarts.

If there's 10 quarts left, they musta started with 38 plus 10, which is 48 quarts.

Now, there's 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 quarts is 48 divided by 4, which is 12 gallons.

"
"Well, Dale started with 100 candies, but sold 150. That's more than he had! So he musta ordered more. He got another 100, so now he has 200 candies.

200 

"
"Well, let's see...

* January: 10 students * 2 = 20 students
* February: 20 students * 2 = 40 students
* March: 40 students * 2 = 80 students
* April: 80 students * 2 = 160 students
* May: 160 students * 2 = 320 students

So, there are 320 students at the end of May.

That means 320 - 10 = 310 extra students joined.

310 

"
"Well, if he made $105 for the whole week, and there are 7 days in a week, we gotta divide that by 7 to see how much he made each day.

That's $15 a day.

Now, each branch costs $.25, so we gotta divide how much he made each day by how much each branch costs.

That's $15 divided by $.25.

"
"Okay, so she picks a bunch of flowers, right? Let's see...

* First, she gets 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals.
* Then she gets 4 flowers with 6 petals, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 petals.
* Then she gets 5 flowers with 4 petals, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 petals.
* And lastly, she gets 6 flowers with 7 petals, so that's 6 times 7, which is 42 petals.

Now, she drops one of each kind, so that's 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals total.

But she drops one of each, so we gotta take away 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

So, 101 minus 22 is 79 petals.


79 

"
"Let's see... they used 9 plus 9 marshmallows, that's 18. Then they lost 3 more. So that's 18 plus 3, which is 21 marshmallows gone.

That leaves 35 minus 21 marshmallows, which is 14.

Since they each get the same amount, they each get 14 divided by 2, which is 7. 


7 

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His two friends who aren't as good play half as long, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter. His other friend plays longer, so he plays for 20 times 1.5 which is 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 times 60 minutes, so that's 240 minutes.

Let's see... Jack can play for 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His two weaker friends can play for 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each.

His better friend can play for 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

So that's 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 quarters.

"
"Let's break this down.

She uses the same amount of salt and sugar, and twice as much oil as salt. So if she uses 1 ounce of salt, she uses 2 ounces of oil and 1 ounce of sugar.

She uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, and twice as much salt as zest. So if she uses 1 ounce of zest, she uses 1 ounce of fragrance and 2 ounces of salt.

That means she uses 1 ounce of zest, 1 ounce of fragrance, 2 ounces of salt, 2 ounces of sugar, and 4 ounces of oil.

That's a total of 10 ounces.

"
"Let's see... he bought 3 goats times $500... that's $1500.

Then he bought 2 cows times $1500... that's $3000.

$4500 

"
"Let's see... Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones.  So that's 8 plus 40, which is 48 cupcakes.

63 minus 48 is... 15.

"
"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is (20/100) * 40 = 8 cars.

Then he gives away twice the number he sold, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

In total, he gets rid of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That means Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

16 

"
"Okay, so the students raised some money, right?  

Let's see... the charity got $175,000 total, and $50,000 came from other places. That means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, there are 20 students, so each one raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.


$6,250
"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.  The second day she walked half that time, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 hours.

That means she walked a total of 8 plus 4, which is 12 hours.

Now, there are 60 minutes in every hour, so 12 hours times 60 minutes is...

720 

"
"Okay, so Hunter saw 50 cars at first. Then 20 more came, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Then half of them left, so that's 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

"
"Okay, so he does 30 cycles a day times 5 tasks each, that's 150 tasks a day.

Then he makes 150 tasks times $1.20, so that's $180 a day.

"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, so she got 4 points.

To find Sasha's total points, we add up her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18

"
"Let's see... 8 packages of cat food times 11 tins in each package is 88 tins.

And 6 packages of dog food times 6 tins in each package is 36 tins.

So, 88 minus 36 is... 52.

"
"Let's see...  

If Smendrick has 3 times the cards PJ has, and they have 341 cards total, that means PJ has way less than Smendrick.

Becca has more than Smendrick, so she must have the most cards.

Hmm... this is tricky. I'm not good at math.

123 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 blue eggs.

She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 10 minus 1, which is 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 divided by 3, which is 3 yellow eggs.

Now to find the total, we add up all the eggs: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27


27
"
"Okay, so the book is heavy and far away.  Let's see...

Shipping cost is 4 pounds times 35 cents, that's $1.40. Then you gotta add the miles, 20 times 8 cents, which is $1.60. So shipping is $3 total.

Now, Amazon only gives back 75% of the money, so that's 32 dollars times 0.75, which is $24.

So she loses the $3 for shipping plus the $8 she doesn't get back, that's $11.


11 

"
"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 more. That's $40 + $100 = $140.

Then she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's $30 x 2 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

So, all together she spends $60 + $20 = $80.

That means she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.


$60
"
"Okay, so Boris makes a lotta chocolate!

First week he makes 8,000 bars.

Second week he makes half of that, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

Third week he makes three times the first week, so 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars.

That's a whole lotta chocolate!

Now, to find out how much he makes the fourth week, we gotta do some addin'.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: 4,000 bars
Third week: 24,000 bars

Total so far: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

He makes 50,000 bars a month, so he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars the fourth week.



14,000 

"
"Okay, so Britany makes a lotta TikToks.  

Let's see... 18 videos times 4 minutes each is 72 minutes just for makin' the videos.

That's 1 hour and 12 minutes.

Then she sings for 2 hours.

And makeup is 15 minutes a day, so that's 15 times 6 days, which is 90 minutes.

That's another hour and a half.

So, all together, that's 1 hour 12 minutes + 2 hours + 1 hour 30 minutes.

That's 4 hours and 42 minutes a week.

Now, there are 4 weeks in a month, so she spends 4 times that much time on TikTok each month.

4 times 4 hours and 42 minutes is... hmm... let me see...

17 hours and 168 minutes.

That's a lotta TikTok!

1768 



"
"Okay, so they charge $129 to hang the basic stuff.  

She's got more mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures than the basic deal.

Let's see... extra mirrors... she's got 2 more mirrors than the 4 they do in the deal.

And 1 more chandelier.

And a whole bunch more pictures! 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.

So that's 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 extra things.

13 things times $15 each is 13 * 15 = $195.

So, add that to the $129... $129 + $195 = $324.00



$324.00 

"
"Okay, so Eva has $20.00. Anthony has $10.00 more than that, so he has $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so that's like... a little more than $10.00 extra.  

40% of $30.00 is $12.00.

So Roy has $30.00 + $12.00


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

Kagiyami lifts it 4 times higher than Saskay, and Saskay lifts it 12 times higher than Pompei. So Kagiyami lifts it 4 * 12 = 48 times higher than Pompei.

Naruto lifts it 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto lifts it 10 * 48 = 480 times higher than Pompei.

Pompei lifts it 1 inch, so Naruto lifts it 480 inches.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto lifts it 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"
"Well, he goes 8 miles every hour, right? So in 4 hours, that's 8 times 4, which is 32 miles. Then he goes for another 6 hours, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 miles.  

32 + 48 
80 

"
"Well, if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, so 54 hours.

Now, turtles are way slower than kangaroos. If a turtle is half as fast, it'd take twice as long. So one turtle would take 54 hours times 2, which is 108 hours.

And since we got four turtles, we gotta divide that time by four. 108 hours divided by 4 is 27 hours.

"
"Okay, so Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, who made 20. That means Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 40 x 2 = 80 dishes.

To find the total, we add up all the dishes: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"Okay, so Erika's new laptop is cheaper cuz she's trading in her old one.

It's $600 minus $200, so that's $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80, so that's $150 + $80 = $230.

She only needs $50 more, so she must have $230 - $50 = $180 in her purse.

"Okay, so Adam has big apples and little apples.  The big ones make more pieces. He cuts up a bunch of each. Then he eats some.  

Let's see... 3 big apples times 5 pieces each is 15 pieces.  And 5 little apples times 3 pieces each is 15 pieces too. So that's 30 pieces in all.

He ate 15, so... 30 minus 15 is 15.


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 5 liters from each cow, and he's got 3 cows, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 liters.

He wants 25 liters, so he needs 25 minus 15, which is 10 more liters.

Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 divided by 5, which is 2 more cows.

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much glue is gone from each stick, then add that up.

First stick: 12 millimeters - (1/6 * 12 millimeters) = 10 millimeters left

Second stick: 12 millimeters - (2/3 * 12 millimeters) = 4 millimeters left

Third stick: 12 millimeters - (1/2 * 12 millimeters) = 6 millimeters left

Now we add up what's left: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters

"Okay, so Gabriel wants to buy a car and a phone. That's gonna cost him a lot of money!

Let's see... the car is ten thousand dollars and the phone is eight hundred dollars.  That's a total of ten thousand eight hundred dollars.

He has five thousand dollars from work and two hundred dollars from his brother. That's five thousand two hundred dollars altogether.

So, if we take the total cost and subtract what he has, we'll know how much more he needs.

Ten thousand eight hundred minus five thousand two hundred... hmm... that's five thousand six hundred dollars.

"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes. He got twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Together they have 30 + 60 + 30 + 60 = 180 socks and dishes.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many shirts don't have buttons or collars.

Let's see... half of the white shirts have collars, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars.

That means 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts don't have collars.

20 floral shirts have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Now we gotta see how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars.

That's 30 - 20 = 10

"Okay, so you got 3 baskets of green food, that's 3 times $25, which is $75.

Then you got 3 baskets of red food, but they're $2 off each, so each one is $16.

"Okay, so they gotta clean half the rooms, which is 90 divided by 2, that's 45 rooms.

Then they gotta clean each room for 20 minutes, so that's 45 times 20, which is 900 minutes.

"Okay, so Claire gets one badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one badge every two months. Wendy gets three times as many as Claire, so she gets three badges a month.

In a year, Claire gets 12 badges. Amber gets 12 badges / 2 = 6 badges. Wendy gets 12 badges * 3 = 36 badges.

Wendy gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Okay, so Tobias ate a bunch of pizza.

First day he ate 60 pieces times 2/5, which is 24 pieces.

Then he ate 10 more pieces the next day.

Now we gotta figure out how much he ate on the third day.

He had 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

If he's makin' $9000 and wants to make $2000 profit, he musta spent $7000 on the chickens.


7000

"Micah and Mitchell sold the rest of the lemonade, so they sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses together.

They each sold half of that, so Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.

A manicure cost 1/4 of that, so that's $400 / 4 = $100.

A pedicure cost 3/4 of the manicure price, so that's $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


575 

"
"Okay, so Sarah's rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 a meter. That means she makes 20 times 2 dollars, which is 40 dollars.

Then she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.50 a meter.  She needs to figure out how much that will cost.

Let me see... 20 meters times $1.50... that's 30 dollars.

So she made 40 dollars and spent 30 dollars.  That means she has 40 minus 30 dollars left.

10 

"
"Well, if she's gonna be 18 in 10 years, that means she's 8 now.  

To be three times her age, she'd have to be 24.

That's 16 more years.

"
"Okay, let's see...

Bacon is $10 for 5 packs, so one pack is $2.

Chicken is twice the price of bacon, so each pack is $4.

Six packs of chicken cost $4 times 6, which is $24.

Strawberries are $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 times 3, which is $12.

Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they are $4 divided by 2, which is $2 each.

Seven packs of apples cost $2 times 7, which is $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of everything: $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $60.

If her budget is $65 and her groceries cost $60, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.


$5 

"
"Well, if the concert is twice as long as usual plus an extra 15 minutes, we gotta take the 15 minutes off first.

That leaves us with 50 minutes.

Then we gotta split that 50 minutes in half 'cause it's twice as long as usual.

50 / 2 = 25

"Argo gave away a whole bunch of toys! Let's see... 40 plus 80 plus 30... that's 150 toys.  

If he started with 200 and gave away 150...

50
"
"Okay, so they make a bunch on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then double it on Friday.  Let's see...

125 plus 125 is 250.

Then on Friday they make double that, so that's 250 times 2... which is 500.

So all together, that's 250 plus 500...

500 + 250 = 750

"
"Well, if he's got 50 microphones and 20% can't fit, that means 80% of them can.

Let's see... 80% of 50... that's 40 microphones.

And since he's pairing them up, that's 40 divided by 2.

20 

"
"Okay, so Jerry sees six birds in the bushes. Then he sees two-thirds of that, which is like cutting the six birds into three groups and taking two of them. That's four more birds.  And then there are three groups of eight birds, so that's three times eight, which is twenty-four birds.

Let's add them all up: six plus four plus twenty-four.

"Okay, so Joelle's daisies have way more petals than her orchids.

Let's see... 4 daisies times 10 petals each is 40 petals.

And her orchids have 5 orchids times 5 petals each, so that's 25 petals.

40 minus 25 is... 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has a lotta plants!

First, we gotta figure out how many are inside. One-fourth of 100 is 25, right?

That leaves 75 plants left over.

Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 50 plants.

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be the flowery ones.

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowery.

That's 25%.

"
"Well, a whatchamacallit is way faster than a thingamabob, eleven times faster! And the whirligig is even faster than that, five times faster than a thingamabob.

So if the whatchamacallit goes 121 meters per second, and that's eleven times faster than a thingamabob, then a thingamabob goes 121 divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.

Now, the whirligig is five times faster than a thingamabob, so it goes 11 times 5, which is 55 meters per second.


55 

"
"Let's see...

Salad is $6 and yogurt is half that, so yogurt is $3.

That means the carrots cost $11 - $6 - $3 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots, one carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1.


$1 

"
"Okay, so Mark makes more money now, that's good! He works a lot of hours.

Let's see... he makes $12 an hour now.  So in a day he makes 8 times 12, which is 96 dollars.

Then we gotta do 96 times 5 for the whole week.

96 times 5 is 480.

"
"Lemonade money is tricky.  Let's see... she made 80 bucks total.

Mowing Kamala's lawn three times as much as Joe's... and Alba's five times as much... that's a lot of mowing!

Joe paid her 6 dollars, so... hmm...

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn once. Then Kamala's three times, that's three times. And Alba's five times, that's five times.

That's a lot of lawns!

I dunno, I'm not good at math.

But if she made 80 dollars total, and Joe paid her 6...

80 - 6 = 74

"Okay, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Okay, so John makes $25 for every hour he rents his car. He rents it out for 3 hours each time, so that's 25 times 3, which is 75 dollars each time.

He rents it out 10 times a month, so he makes 75 times 10, which is 750 dollars a month.

His car payment is 500 dollars, so he makes 750 minus 500, which is 250 dollars profit.

"
"Martha has 7 notebooks now, and she had 2 before she bought more.

Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha had before, so he has 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

"Okay, so Jo needs more material for the small masks 'cause she makes more of those.  

Let's see... 20 small masks divided by 4 masks per 2 yards is 5 yards for the small ones.

For the big masks, 8 masks divided by 3 masks per 2.25 yards is... hmm... a little over 2 yards.

So, 5 yards plus a little over 2 yards... that's gotta be around 7 yards.

"Well, Deepa saw 9 movies times 3 viewings each, so that's a whole lotta movies! That's 27 movies in total.

She spent $216 on all those tickets.

"Well, Harold sleeps a whole lot!  That's a long time.  He works less than he sleeps, so let's see... 10 hours sleep minus 2 hours is 8 hours of work.  Then he walks his dog for an hour, so that's 8 plus 1, which is 9 hours.

24

"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He takes 3 blue boxes for fishin', so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left.

Now for the red boxes, he takes a third of them, which is 9 / 3 = 3 red boxes. That means he has 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.


4 + 6

"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives some to Jamie and Donald.  

First, let's see how many he gives to Jamie.  One-fifth of 30 is like splitting the marbles into 5 groups and taking one group. That's 30 divided by 5, which is 6 marbles for Jamie.

Then he gives 10 to Donald.

So, he gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many he has left, we subtract: 30 - 16 = 14

"Okay, so Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does less than 50 an hour, 10 less, so that's 40 packages an hour.

In a day, that's 40 times 8, which is 320 packages.

Now, 320 times 0.20 is... 64 dollars.

"
"Okay, so Benny throws two bologna at each red one and three at each yellow one. He used 58 bologna in all.  He threw at 20 red balloons, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 bologna.

That means he used 58 - 40 = 18 bologna on the yellow balloons.

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 bologna, there must be 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"
"Okay, so Bruce works a lot.

Tuesday: 5 hours

"Let's see... they bought a cake for $11 and balloons for... hmm, a dozen balloons is 12 balloons, and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 sets of balloons.  That means the balloons cost 6 * $0.5 = $3.

Then they bought ice cream for $7 each, and they got 2 tubs, so that's 2 * $7 = $14.

So all together they spent $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, they each had $28 / 2 = $14.

"Okay, so they sold 30 students times 10 lollipops each, that's 300 lollipops.

They sold them for 80 cents each and they cost 50 cents each, so they made 30 cents profit on each one.

300 lollipops times 30 cents profit each is... 9000 cents.

That's 90 dollars!

"Okay, lemme see...

Larry has 3 cats times 3 is 9 dogs.

He has 9 dogs minus 2 is 7 rabbits.

He has 7 rabbits times 3 is 21 fish.

"Let's see... half of 10,000 gallons is 5,000 gallons.

So they put 5,000 gallons in the tank.

If they use 500 gallons a day, after 6 days they'll have used 500 x 6 = 3,000 gallons.

That means they'll have 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left.

"
"Okay, so Colby has $150. He already spent some on movies and snacks. Let's see...

Friday tickets are $10, and he saw 5 of those already, so that's 5 times $10, which is $50.

Other day tickets are $7, and he saw 8 of those, so that's 8 times $7, which is $56.

Popcorn is $8, and he had 2 of those, so that's 2 times $8, which is $16.

Candy is $2, and he had 4 of those, so that's 4 times $2, which is $8.

Now let's add up all that spending: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

So he spent $130 already, leaving him with $150 - $130 = $20.

Tonight's ticket is $10, popcorn is $8, and candy is $2, so that's $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

That means he can see 1 more movie tonight.

"Okay, so he made a bunch of little cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins.  The big ones have lots of calories, but the little ones only have a third of those. Gotta do some math here...

Let's see... 600 calories in a big cinnamon roll, and the little ones have a third of that, so they have 200 calories each.

And the blueberry muffins, they have 450 calories big, so the little ones have 150 calories each.

He made 200 little cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 times 200 calories, which is 40,000 calories.

And 300 little blueberry muffins times 150 calories each is 45,000 calories.

Now we gotta add those together... 40,000 plus 45,000 is 85,000 calories.

85,000

"Let's see... she got a whole bunch of Junebugs!

Twice the amount from Monday is 39 times 2, which is 78.

So Tuesday and Wednesday she got 78 Junebugs each day.

That's a lot of Junebugs!

To find the average, we add up all the Junebugs and divide by the number of days.

39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

300 divided by 5 days is 60.

"Let's see...

Paul is older than John, and Peter is as old as Paul and John put together.  That means Peter is older than both of them.

If all three are 100 years old together, and Peter is the oldest, he must be more than half their age.

So Peter is probably around 50 or a little older.

"Well, the Widgeteer 3000 makes more widgets, that's for sure.  

Let's see... 60 widgets an hour is a lot more than 45. And it runs all day and night for a whole month!

That's a lot of widgets!

60 widgets an hour times 24 hours is 1440 widgets a day.

Then you times that by 30 days... that's 43,200 widgets!

The WidgetMaster 9000 only makes 45 times 24, which is 1080 a day.

And then times 30 days... that's 32,400 widgets.

So the Widgeteer makes 43,200 minus 32,400, which is 10,800 more widgets.

10,800 widgets times $6 each is... $64,800.

He wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so now he has 250 minus 100... that's 150 dollars left.

Those pencils cost 10 dollars each, and he buys 5, so that's 10 times 5... which is 50 dollars.

He has 150 dollars and spends 50 on pencils, so he has 150 minus 50... that's 100 dollars left.

Now he can buy pens! Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 divided by 25... which is 4 pens.

"Okay, so James got some CDs, but they were on sale. Then he sold some. Let's see...

He got 10 CDs at $15 each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150.

But they were 40% off, so we gotta figure out what 40% of 150 is.

That's like 150 divided by 10, which is 15, then times 4, which is 60.

So he saved 60 bucks.

That means he paid 150 minus 60, which is 90 for the CDs.

Then he sold 5 of them for 40 bucks total.

So he's out 90 minus 40, which is 50.

"Okay, so James swims 60% of 20 miles, which is 12 miles.

That takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

He rests for half that time, so 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

He has 8 miles left to swim, and now he's going 1 mile per hour.

That takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

So, the total time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Okay, so Sam had 70 loaves.

Seven times that is 7 times 70, which is 490.

"Okay, so Cayley sells some newspapers and gets paid a little extra for each one.

Let's see... 6 New York Times papers at $5 each is 6 times 5, which is 30 bucks. He gets 10% of that, so that's 30 times 0.10, which is 3 dollars.

Now the Wall Street Journal ones are trickier. 10 papers at $15 each is 10 times 15, which is 150 dollars. He gets 8% of that, so that's 150 times 0.08, which is 12 dollars.

So, in total, he makes 3 dollars plus 12 dollars, which is 15 dollars.

After that, we can take Bahati's score and subtract 20 to find Azibo's score.

Hmm, I don't know how many points Dinar scored though.  

 

"
"Well, if it's 100 pages per inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick, that means there's gotta be a whole lotta pages in there!

"
"Okay, so Vince staples real fast, 30 reports every 15 minutes.  That's a lot of staplin'!

Let's see... from 8 in the mornin' till 11 at night, that's a long time.  Gotta figure out how many 15 minute chunks are in that time.

* 8:00 to 12:00 is 4 hours, and that's 16 fifteen-minute chunks.
* 12:00 to 11:00 is another 11 hours, so that's 44 more chunks.

That's a total of 60 chunks!

So, 60 chunks times 30 reports each...

60 * 30 = 1800


1800 

"
"Well, she usually sleeps from 10pm to 6am. That's 8 hours.

8 hours is 480 minutes.

She woke up early to pee, so she slept 5 minutes less.

She also sleepwalked for a bit, but that don't count as sleepin'.

So, 480 minutes minus 5 minutes is 475 minutes.


475 

"
"Okay, so Jonathan has lots of cups, two dozen is like 2 times 12, so that's 24 cups.

He has less spoons, only 2/3 as many.  That means we gotta divide the cups by 3, which is 8, and then times that by 2, so 8 times 2 is 16 spoons.

But then he gives some away, 6 spoons. So he has 16 minus 6, which is 10 spoons left.

Now we add the cups and spoons he has left: 24 cups plus 10 spoons is 34.


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital has a thousand beds, and one-fifth are full. That means 1000 divided by 5 is 200 beds are full.

So there are 1000 minus 200, which is 800 empty beds.

Now, they get 50 new patients every day. Over two weeks, that's 50 times 14, which is 700 new patients.

That means there are 800 minus 700 empty beds, which is 100.


100 

"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  Seven are for work, so that leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails left.

Two-thirds of those are to family, so that's 9 x (2/3) = 6 emails to family.

That means 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left. Those are for her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

45 

"
"Well, Courtney said there were 48 people, but she counted too high. Kelly said it was 20% too many.  

So, we gotta figure out what 20% of 48 is.

That's like finding a tenth of 48 and then doubling it. A tenth of 48 is 4.8, and double that is 9.6.

So Courtney was off by 9.6 people.

Take that away from what Courtney said, and you get the real number.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have part of a person, we gotta round down.


38 

"
"Well, if Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice that, he musta had 4 balls.  Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason, so he only had 1 ball.

That's 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls in total.

"
"Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more, and then 8 more. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.

But they filled in 2, so there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as at the end of the first day, so there were 10 * 4 = 40 holes.

They needed to dig 40 - 29 = 11 more holes.


11 

"
"Well, if Amora and Lainey got 70 each, that's 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.

And Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

So altogether, they had 140 + 85 = 225 corn chips.

225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.  The tickets cost 50% more, so that's like half of the supply cost again.

Half of $400 is $200.

So the tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600.


600
"
"Okay, so Adelwolfe caught some Pokemon.  Stan caught way less than Adelwolfe, but more than Alex. Alex caught a few more than Stan.

Let's see...

* Stan has 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught.

Hmm, that's tricky.

* Alex has 5 more than Stan.

So Stan is in the middle.

* Together they caught 339.

That's a lot of Pokemon!

Let me think...

...

104 

"
"Well, if each show is 20 minutes long, and there's half as many shows as minutes in a show, that means there's 20 / 2 = 10 shows.

So he'll be watchin' 10 shows * 20 minutes a show = 200 minutes.

200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for a long time, then north a little bit, then south again.  

Let's see... 10 hours times 30 miles per hour is 300 miles south. Then 2 hours times 18 miles per hour is 36 miles north.  Then 5 hours times 22 miles per hour is 110 miles south.

So, 300 miles south minus 36 miles north plus 110 miles south...

300 - 36 + 110 = 374


374 

"
"Okay, so Greta had 12 brownies from her own batch. Then she got 6 more from work.  That's 18 brownies. Her friends brought 48 brownies. So now she has 66 brownies. They ate 18 brownies at the party.

66 - 18 = 48

"
"Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years younger than him, so she is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

"
"Okay, so let's see...

* Synthetic gut takes 15 minutes each, and he's got 3 of those. That's 15 times 3, which is 45 minutes.

* Polyester takes 22 minutes each, and he's got 5 of those. That's 22 times 5, which is 110 minutes.

* Hybrids take 18 minutes each, and he's got 4 of those. That's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes.

Now we gotta add all that time together: 45 plus 110 plus 72 is 227 minutes.


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, that's $600 times 2, which is $1200.

Then the other two phones are half price, so they're $600 divided by 2, which is $300 each.

So those two cost $300 times 2, which is $600.

Now we add the two prices together: $1200 plus $600 is $1800.


1800 

"
"Okay, so Zeke's team has more players.  

Zeke's team has 7 + 13 = 20 players.

Now we add Zeke's players and Carlton's players together.

20 + 13 = 33

"
"Okay, so he's got a fence that's 15 feet long on one side and 10 feet long on the other side. That's like a big rectangle!  He needs two slats for every foot, so we gotta add up all the feet and then times it by two.

15 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet

50 feet times 2 slats per foot = 100 slats

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington starts with 12 boxes. She gives away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She keeps 1/4 of those, which is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes.

That means she sells 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

She sells 6 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 120 oranges.

"Well, I heard the USA has a whole bunch of states, like, a lot!  More than 20 for sure.  If India has 4 more than half of that, they must have a good amount too.

"
"Let's see... he needs to buy a dictionary, a dinosaur book, and a cookbook. That's $18 plus $13 plus $8, which is $39.

He only has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

If he earns $5 each hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Let's see... Robert has a whole bunch of cherries, 30! And Richard has 10 less than him. So Richard has 20 cherries.

That leaves 10 cherries for Jerry.

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 gingerbread and 4 less apple pies than Sunday.  That means he sold 10 - 4 = 6 apple pies on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 gingerbread and 15 apple pies.

Now, let's figure out how much he made each day.

Saturday: 10 gingerbread * $6 = $60 from gingerbread and 6 apple pies * $15 = $90 from apple pies. That's $60 + $90 = $150 on Saturday.

Sunday: 15 gingerbread * $6 = $90 from gingerbread and 15 apple pies * $15 = $225 from apple pies. That's $90 + $225 = $315 on Sunday.

Finally, add up both days: $150 + $315 = $465


465 

"
"Let's see... she uses one ounce each hour, and she's outside for 4 hours a day. So that's 1 times 4, which is 4 ounces a day.

She's on vacation for 8 days, so she'll need 4 times 8, which is 32 ounces.

Each bottle has 8 ounces, so she'll need 32 divided by 8, which is 4 bottles.

"
"Okay, so the red car is cheaper.  It costs 40% less than the blue one, which is $100.  That means the red car is $60.

If you add the price of the blue car and the red car, you get the total cost.

160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is gonna be 24 soon. That's five years from now.

When he's 24, his dad will be twice his age, so his dad will be 48.

And Emil's brother will be half his age, so his brother will be 12.

Now, to find out how old they are now, we gotta subtract those five years.

So the dad is 43 now, and the brother is 7.

43 plus 7 is 50.

"Her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her 20 x 2 = 40 beads.

Altogether, she has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

"
"Okay, so Joe got a whole bunch of crawfish!

Let's see... he got 3 pounds on Thursday, and then 4 times that on Friday, so that's 3 times 4 which is 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he got half of what he got on Friday, so that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6 pounds.

Altogether, he has 3 plus 12 plus 6 pounds, which is 21 pounds.

Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 divided by 3, which is 7 servings.

"
"Okay, so first we gotta figure out how many kids play football. Twenty percent of thirty is... hmm...  Let's see, twenty is a fifth of a hundred, so twenty percent of thirty is six.

So six kids play football. That leaves twenty-four kids left.

Now, twenty-five percent of those twenty-four kids are cheerleaders or in band.  That's...  carry the one... six!

So six kids are cheerleaders or in band.

Altogether, that's six football players plus six cheerleaders and band kids, which makes twelve kids leaving early.

111 feet long flower bed.

1.5 feet between each plant.

17 plants already.

$6 per plant.

"Okay, so she needs 3 petunias times 5 baskets, that's 15 petunias.

And 2 sweet potato vines times 5 baskets is 10 vines.

15 petunias times $3.00 each is $45.00

10 vines times $2.50 each is $25.00

$45.00 plus $25.00 is $70.00

"
"Let's see... sunflowers take up a lot of soil, 4 sunflowers is 4 times 3 pounds, that's 12 pounds.

Carnations need a bit less, 10 carnations is 10 times 1.5 pounds, that's 15 pounds.

So far they used 12 plus 15 pounds, that's 27 pounds.

They started with 30 pounds and used 27, so they have 3 pounds left for roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses.

"
"Okay, so Jessica saves up a quarter of her money each month. That's like cuttin' a pizza into four slices and takin' one.

So she saves 2000 / 4 = $500.00 each month.

Now, each pair of shoes costs a whole lotta money, a thousand bucks!

So she can buy 500 / 1000 = half a pair of shoes each month.

In a year, that's 0.5 * 12 = 6 pairs of shoes.


6 

"
"Okay, so Emily peels 6 shrimp every minute.  That means to peel 90 shrimp, it'll take her 15 minutes (90 / 6 = 15).

Now, she cooks 30 shrimp every 10 minutes. So to cook 90 shrimp, that's 3 batches of 30.  That's 30 minutes of cookin' (3 x 10 = 30).

So, all together, it'll take her 45 minutes (15 + 30 = 45).

45 

"
"Okay, so it cooled down 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees cooler.

Then it cooled down 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees cooler.

That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.

But then it warmed up 2 degrees each hour for 2 hours, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees warmer.

So it ended up 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler.

"
"Let's see... he writes one check for electric, one for gas, and two for church every month.  That's four checks a month.

He writes a check to the pest and lawn people every three months, so that's four checks a year.

So, four checks a month times twelve months is forty-eight checks. Plus four more for the yard.

48 + 4 = 52

"
"Okay, so the first plane goes to Greece a lot, like most of the time.  The rest of the time it goes to France or Germany, but the same amount to each. The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less than the first plane.

Let's see... if the second plane flies 44 times and that's only half of what the first plane does, then the first plane flies 44 times 2, which is 88 times.

If the first plane goes to Greece 3/4 of the time, then it goes to Greece 88 times times 3/4, which is 66 times.

That means it goes to France and Germany a total of 88 times minus 66 times, which is 22 times.

Since it goes to France and Germany the same amount, it goes to France 22 times divided by 2, which is 11 times.



11 

"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote together, so that's 20 plus 40, which is 60 seconds.

Now, to find the total time, we add up all their howling times: 20 plus 40 plus 60 is 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 120 divided by 60, which is 2 minutes.


2 

"
"His dad gave him $6 times 2, which is $12.

That's $6 from his mom plus $12 from his dad, which is $18.

So Adam had to pay $30 - $18 = $12.

"
"Let's see... Helene is the oldest, and she's twice the average age of all of them.  If all their ages added up is 20, we gotta figure out what the average age is first.

20 divided by 4 kids is 5, so the average age is 5.

That means Helene is 5 times 2, which is 10 years old.

So Akbar is 3, Alessandro is 4, and Helene is 10.  That's 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.

Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

3 

"
"Okay, so Walter gets $500 plus $1500, that's $2000.

Then his friend gives him $200.

So that's $2200 total.

His lawyer gives three times that much.

So the lawyer gives $2200 times 3.

6600 

"
"Okay, so there were a lot of cookies! 100 guests times 15 cookies each is a whole lotta cookies.  

Let's see... half of them went to the church.  

If each person at the church got 15 cookies, we gotta figure out how many people that is.

...

50 

"
"Well, there are 2 grownups and 4 little ones, so that's 6 people in total.

Each grownup gets a slice twice as big as a kid's slice, so think of it like the grownups get 2 parts and the kids get 1 part each.

That means each grownup gets 2 parts and each kid gets 1 part, for a total of 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 parts.

So each grownup gets 2 out of 8 parts, which is like 25%.

"
"Okay, so Doc has to see nine folks in the hospital, and that takes 20 minutes each.  That's 9 times 20, which is 180 minutes.  

Then he's got ten appointments, and those are 30 minutes each. So that's 10 times 30, which is 300 minutes.

Let's see... 180 plus 300 is 480 minutes.  

Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 480 minutes is 480 divided by 60, which is 8 hours.

He's at the clinic for 9 hours total, and he's busy for 8 hours, so he has 9 minus 8, which is 1 hour left.


1 

"
"Okay, so she needs to bake it, let it cool, and then frost it.  That's a lot of time!

Let's see... 20 minutes to make, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours to cool, and 10 minutes to frost.

That's 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

180 minutes is 3 hours.

So she needs 3 hours to make the cake ready.

If she wants it ready at 5:00, she needs to start at 2:00.


2:00 

"
"Let's see... they sold a bunch of boxes together, and we know how many bars they sold in total.  If we figure out how many boxes they sold all together, we can divide the total bars by the number of boxes.

They sold 3 and a half plus 4 and a half boxes, so that's 8 boxes.

64 bars divided by 8 boxes is... 8 bars per box!

8 

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 every time they use the studio, and then $1.50 for each kid. They got 10 kids, so that's $1.50 times 10, which is $15.  So each time they have class, they make $25 + $15, which is $40.

They have class 3 times a week, so that's $40 times 3, which is $120 a week.

A month has about 4 weeks, so they make $120 times 4, which is $480.


480 

"
"Let's see... Peter has 64 chocolates and they're split into 4 boxes, so he must have 16 in each box. Martha has 56 chocolates in 7 boxes, so she has 8 in each box.

16 - 8 = 8

"
"Okay, so there's 50 porcupines in the park.  And 3/5 of them are girls.  That's like, 30 porcupines.

Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month. So in a year, that's 4 babies times 12 months, which is 48 babies per girl.

So 30 girls times 48 babies is... a lot of babies!

That's 1440 babies.

Now we gotta add that to the original 50 porcupines.

1440 plus 50 is 1490.


1490 

"
"Okay, so they said to multiply the size of the pool by 5.9 to know how much water it takes.  

First, we gotta figure out how big the pool is. That's like figuring out how much stuff can fit in a box. We multiply the length, width, and depth.

So, 14 feet times 25 feet times 4 feet... lemme see... that's 1400.

Now we gotta multiply that by 5.9 to see how many gallons that is.

1400 times 5.9 is 8260 gallons.

Now, they charge 10 cents for every gallon.

So, 8260 times 0.10 is... $826.


826 

"
"Okay, so they got 9 red sticks.  And 5 more blue than red, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

The yellow sticks are 3 less than the blue, so that's 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now we gotta add 'em all up: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

"
"Well, Matteo drove 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so he drove 55 times 4 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles every hour for 10 hours, so she drove 45 times 10 miles.

To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we gotta subtract how far Matteo drove from how far Shandy drove.

220 



"
"Okay, so half of the students are over 16, that's 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.

And one-fourth of them are boys, so that's 1500 / 4 = 375 boys.

That means there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500 students.

Half of them are boys, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 boys.

That means there are 1500 - 750 = 750 girls under 16.

So in total, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.


1875

"Okay, so Trey runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

"
"Okay, so Wanda filled a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 divided by 4, that's 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped three-quarters of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped 4500 times 3 divided by 4, which is 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped two-thirds of her first day's amount, so that's 4500 times 2 divided by 3, which is 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped one-third of her first day's amount, so that's 3375 divided by 3, which is 1125 gallons.

Let's add up all the water they pumped: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Now, subtract that from the tank's capacity to see how much is left: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.



6000 

"
"Well, lemme see... it's like this. The power bank was losin' juice faster at first, then slower.  Gotta figure out how much it lost each time, then add it up.

28% is what was left, so it lost the rest.

* First, it lost 9% an hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.
* Then it lost 7% an hour for 3 hours, so that's 7 * 3 = 21% gone.
* Altogether, it lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.

If 28% is left, and it lost 66%, then it started with 28% + 66% = 94%.

"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour plus $15 an hour in tips, so that's $25 an hour.

She needs 20% of $10,000 which is $2,000.

"Let's see... I know peaches and pears are 50 cents each, apples are 75 cents, and kiwis are a dollar.  Plums are 25 cents.

He bought 3 peaches, so that's 3 times 50 cents, which is $1.50.

He got 4 pears, so that's 4 times 50 cents, which is $2.00.

He got 2 kiwis, so that's 2 times a dollar, which is $2.00.

And he got 5 apples, so that's 5 times 75 cents, which is $3.75.

So far, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

He started with $10.00 and spent $9.25, so he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums are 25 cents each, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.

"Let's see... Anne had 15 packs and kept 2, so that leaves 13 packs for her friends.

Each pack has 60 sweets, so 13 packs have 13 times 60 sweets.

She gave them to 10 friends, so each friend got 780 divided by 10.

"Okay, so the carrots get more expensive each year.  

First year they go up by 5% of $120, that's like $6. So they cost $126.

Then the next year they go up another 5% of $126, which is a little more than $6.

And then the third year they go up again by 5% of the new price.

Let me see...  

$132.30

"
"Let's see... she put the same number of pictures in each album, so 72 pictures divided by 8 albums is 9 pictures per album.

She has 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, so that's 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

And 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.


27 + 18

"Well, if he reads 3 pages every 10 minutes, that means he reads 1 page every 3 and a third minutes.  

So, 18 pages would take him... hmm... 18 times 3 and a third minutes...

"
"Okay, so let's see...

We start with 100 guests. Some left early, some left late, and some new folks came in.

* 100 - 24 = 76 guests left after the early checkouts.
* Then 15 more left late, so 76 - 15 = 61 guests are left.
* Twice as many checked in as late checkouts, so 15 x 2 = 30 new guests.
* Now we have 61 + 30 = 91 guests.
* And 7 more came after dinner, so 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

"
"Okay, so John picked a bunch of bananas.

First, he got 4 on Wednesday. Then he got 6 more on Thursday.

On Friday, he picked three times the amount from Wednesday, so that's 4 times 3 which is 12 bananas.

Now we gotta add them all up: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.

That means there are 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.

Aries gets 75% of those right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions right.

The rest of the questions are 60 - 24 = 36 questions.

Those are split evenly between average and difficult, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

She gets half of those right, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 average right and 18 / 2 = 9 difficult right.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.


36 

"
"Let's see... she sells the big ones for three times the price of the little ones, and she sold twice as many little ones.  That means she made more money from the little ones, right?

If she sold a bunch of little ones for $4 each, and made $120 total, she musta sold a lot of 'em!

...

"
"Let's see... they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.

In a week, that's 11 x 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"
"Okay, so Suzanne sold cookies for a dollar each, so that's 80 times 1, which is 80 bucks.

Then she sold cupcakes for 4 dollars each, so that's 60 times 4, which is 240 dollars.

So all together she made 80 plus 240, which is 320 dollars.

She gave her sisters 10 dollars each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 dollars.

So she has 320 minus 20 dollars left.

300 

"
"Let's see... the twins found 30 eggs each, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Then there were 100 eggs total, and they found 60, so that leaves 100 - 60 = 40 eggs.

But 10 eggs weren't found, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"
"Okay, so one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines more than with an iron one.  He mines 50% more, so that's like half again as much.  

So, with a steel pickaxe, he mines 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds a day. Then half again is 24 / 2 = 12 pounds more.

So with a steel pickaxe, he mines 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, 40 dwarves each mine 36 pounds a day, so that's 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds a day.

In a month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.


43200 

"
"Well, if 2 sandwiches cost $3, then 4 sandwiches would cost $6, that's double.  So 8 sandwiches, which is double 4, would cost double $6.

"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000 but gets $1000 for his old one. That means he still owes $2000.

He has to pay 10% of that each month.

10% of $2000 is $200.

"
"Okay, so Sally had a lot of balloons!

First, some of the red ones popped. Forty percent of 25 is... hmm... that's like a quarter, so 25 divided by 4 is 6.25.  Since you can't have part of a balloon, let's say 6 red balloons popped.

Then she lost half her yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6.

So now she has less red balloons and less yellow balloons.

Then she found some blue balloons! She got to keep most of them, 75% of 8 is... well, 75 is three quarters, so three quarters of 8 is 6.

Now she has some red, some green, some yellow, and some blue balloons. Let's add them up!

25 - 6 = 19 red balloons
7 green balloons
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons
8 - 6 = 2 blue balloons

19 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 34 balloons

"Well, let's see. There's a good chance he won't have to do it if the substitute's there. And even if his regular teacher is there, she might give everyone more time. Plus, he could always try that dog ate my homework thing.

"
"Let's see... 6000 people can fit in the place, and 950 are for the kids graduating and 300 for the teachers.  So that's 950 plus 300, which is 1250 people already there.

That leaves 6000 minus 1250, which is 4750 seats left for everyone else.

If we split those seats equally between the 950 graduates, each graduate gets 4750 divided by 950.

"
"Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so that's 75 x 2 = 150 medium beans.

He eats 3 small beans for every 1 medium bean, so he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small beans.

450 

"
"Well, lemme see here... she works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 hours total.

She makes $15 a day, so over 3 days she makes 15 times 3, which is $45.

But she spends $3 each day on parking, so that's 3 times 3, which is $9 total for parking.

So she makes $45 but spends $9, leaving her with $36.

Now, to find out how much she makes per hour, we gotta divide the $36 by the 18 hours she worked.

36 divided by 18 is... 2.

"
"Let's see... he bought 3 books at 16 dollars each, so that's 3 times 16... which is 48 dollars.

Then he got 3 pencils at 6 dollars each, so that's 3 times 6... which is 18 dollars.

So the books cost 48 dollars and the pencils cost 18 dollars.  That means he spent 48 plus 18 dollars in total.

48 + 18

"
"Okay, so Richard's driveway is 24 feet and he puts a soda every 3 feet.  That means there's gonna be 24 divided by 3, which is 8 sodas.

He takes 5 seconds to get to each one, so it'll take him 8 times 5 seconds.

"
"Let's see... two boxes times forty apples in each box is eighty apples.

Then eighty apples divided by eight apples in each pack is ten packs.

"
"Okay, so Parmesan is fancy cheese, costs more. Mozzarella is cheaper.  Let's see...

Two pounds of Parmesan is 2 times $11, so that's $22.

Three pounds of mozzarella is 3 times $6, so that's $18.

All together, that's $22 plus $18, which is $40.

If she starts with $50 and spends $40, she has $50 minus $40 left.

"
"Well, let's see. He gets 50,000 dollars a year in loans, and he's in school for 4 years, so that's 50,000 times 4, which is 200,000 dollars in loans.

He made 25,000 dollars a year before college, and he was in school for 4 years, so he missed out on 25,000 times 4, which is 100,000 dollars.

That means he owes 200,000 plus 100,000, which is 300,000 dollars.

His new job pays three times what his old job paid, so he makes 25,000 times 3, which is 75,000 dollars a year.

To earn 300,000 dollars, it would take him 300,000 divided by 75,000, which is 4 years.

"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet by 8 feet. He wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider, so that means each piece needs to be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we gotta multiply the length and width of one piece: 8 feet times 10 feet.

10 * 8 = 80


80
"
"Okay, lemme see...

* Monday they delivered 425 letters.
* Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount. One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 divided by 5, which is 85.  So Tuesday they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.
* Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. Twice the amount from Tuesday is 102 x 2 = 204.  So Wednesday they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now to find the total, we add up the letters from each day: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736


736 

"
"Okay, so let's see... 10 folks want the chicken salad at $6.50 each... that's 10 times 6.50... hmm...  

And then 6 people want pasta salad at $6 each... so that's 6 times 6...

Now we gotta add those two amounts together.

...

$91 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

He lost 5 bucks on the first race.

Then he won more on the second race. Twice what he lost is 5 times 2, which is 10.  He won 1 more than that, so he won 11 bucks.

But then he lost again on the third race. He lost 1.5 times what he won, so that's 11 times 1.5, which is 16.50.

So, he lost 5, then won 11, then lost 16.50.

Let me add up all the losses: 5 + 16.50 = 21.50

Now I gotta figure out the average.  I think that means adding up all the money and dividing by the number of races.

21.50 / 3 = 7.17



7.17 

"
"Let's see... 26 countries times 5 cities each... that's 130 cities.

And each city has 1000 people, so... 130 times 1000...

"Xavier grew 3 inches, so now he's 4 feet and 3 inches tall.  That's the same as 48 inches plus 3 inches, which is 51 inches.

Cole grew 2 inches, so now he's 50 inches plus 2 inches, which is 52 inches.

52 inches minus 51 inches is 1 inch.

"
"Let's see... they split the money up, right? The second guy got more than the first, and the third got double what the second got.  

Hmm, that's tricky.

Let's say the first guy got, like, $X. Then the second guy got $X plus $80. And the third guy got double the second guy, so that's like $X plus $80, then times 2.

All that adds up to $1920.

...

I dunno, math ain't my strong suit.

$320 

"
"Well, lemme see... they worked 3/8ths of a day, and there's 8 hours in a day, so that's 3 hours each day.

Then they worked for 3 weeks, and there's 7 days in a week, so that's 21 days total.

So, 3 hours a day times 21 days is 63 hours.


63 

"
"Let's see...  He got more balls in the first set than the second, and the third set was half of the second.  That means the second set musta been a lot of balls.

If he got 19 in total, and the third was half the second, then the second and third together were like 19 split in half, which is 9 and a half.

So the second set was 9 and a half balls.

The first set was 4 more than that, so it was 9 and a half plus 4... which is 13 and a half.

"
"Well, that there car loses a lot of its value each year.  21% is a heap!

Let's see... 2007 to 2010 is three years.

So, first year it loses 21% of 20000, that's...  *counts on fingers* ... 4200 bucks.

So, it's worth 15800 after the first year.

Then it loses another 21% of that... *counts again* ... that's 3318 less.

So now it's worth 12482.

One more year, another 21% off... *struggles with the numbers* ... that's 2621 less.

So, in 2010, the car is worth... 9861.

"
"Okay, so half of the books are in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

And 10% are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.

That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books that are in English or German.

So there must be 50 - 30 = 20 books in Spanish.

"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 folks on the train. Then 20 more get on, so that's 120 + 20 = 140.

Then 50 get off, so now there's 140 - 50 = 90.

But then twice the number who got off get on, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 more people. Now there's 90 + 100 = 190.

Finally, 80 get off, leaving 190 - 80 = 110.

"Okay, let's see...

The shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.

The shoes were $48 / 2 = $24.

The socks were $8 - $2 = $6.

"
"Okay, so you got a big floor, 200 squares.  And each tile is one foot by one foot, so that's one square each.  You need 200 tiles then.

"Okay, so his insurance went up by 60% of $120.  That's like 60 cents outta every dollar.

So 60% of 120 is... lemme see... 60 outta 100 times 120...  

That's 72 dollars more.

So now his insurance is 120 plus 72, which is 192 dollars a month.

A year has 12 months, so 192 times 12 is...

"Okay, so Greg washes 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet every week. His washer can only do 2 twin sheets at once and 1 king sheet at once.  

Let's see... he has to do 2 loads for the twin sheets (4 divided by 2 is 2) and 1 load for the king sheet. So that's 3 loads every week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads a week times 52 weeks...

3 * 52 = 156


156 

"
"Well, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

"Okay, so Leo got 50 stickers last year, and this year he got twice that, so that's 50 times 2 which is 100 stickers.

He had 100 stickers before, plus the 50 from last year, plus the 100 from this year.

That's 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers.

"Let's see... if Betsy took longer than Donovan, and together it was 98 minutes... hmm...

Betsy took 18 more minutes than Donovan, so if we take away those extra minutes, it's like they both took the same amount of time.

98 minutes - 18 minutes = 80 minutes

So, if we split that time in half, that's how long Donovan took.

80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes

Now, we add back those extra 18 minutes Betsy took.

40 minutes + 18 minutes = 58 minutes

"
"Okay, so let's see...

The visit cost $300 an hour, and she was there for half an hour, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.

She needs 30 pills at $4 each, so that's 30 * $4 = $120.

Parking is $6 an hour, and she has to pay for 2 hours, so that's $6 * 2 = $12.

Now we add it all up: $150 + $120 + $12 + $200 = $482

"
"Okay, so James gets a lotta emails, like 80 every day.  But some of them he don't gotta answer, like 20 outta every 100.  So that means he answers 80 outta every 100.

He answers 80 - 16 = 64 emails a day.

In a week, that's 64 x 5 = 320 emails.


320 

"
"Let's see...

Tuesday had twice as many as Monday, so that's 32 times 2, which is 64.

Wednesday had three times as many as Monday, so that's 32 times 3, which is 96.

"Okay, so the glee club ate a lotta pizza!  Let's see... 70% of 20 pizzas is... hmm... that's like 14 pizzas.

The football team got twice as many as the glee club, so they got 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of those, which is...  32 pizzas.

So, the glee club has 6 pizzas left (20 - 14 = 6) and the football team has 8 left (40 - 32 = 8).

That's 14 pizzas left in total.

"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. That means he's sending out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

Now, the small coupons cost 5 cents each, so those cost 700 * $0.05 = $35.

The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so those cost 1400 * $0.15 = $210.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small and big coupons: $35 + $210 = $245.

"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter per dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

The butter is $4.00 a pound, but there's a deal! Buy one, get one half off. So, he's really only paying for 3 pounds at full price.

3 pounds times $4.00 a pound is $12.00.

"Let's see... Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family = 45 people.

But 4 can't come, so that's 45 - 4 = 41 people coming.

"Okay, so the first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.

That means the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day together.

Mr. Robles has enough bananas to feed all three monkeys for a week, so that's 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas a day.

So the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.

"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses.  A dozen is 12, so she's got 3 extra roses.

Let's see... 3 roses is 3 times $2, so that's $6.

A dozen roses is $15, so all together the roses cost $15 + $6, which is $21.

She has five $5 bills, so that's $25.

$25 - $21 is $4.

There are 4 quarters in every dollar, so she gets $4 times 4, which is 16 quarters.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
Burgers: 9 burgers * $11 each = $99.00

"Okay, so the first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20.  The second train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.  The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves right away, so the fourth train comes 20 minutes later, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

"Let's see... she saves 10 toothpicks a week, and she's been doin' that for 12 weeks. So that's 10 times 12, which is 120 toothpicks.

She needs 200, so she still needs 200 minus 120, which is 80 more toothpicks.

If she saves 10 a week, she'll need 80 divided by 10, which is 8 more weeks.

"
"Okay, so Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000. That's like 3 quarters of the price.

Then he sold it for 120% of what he paid. That's like 1 and a fifth times what he paid.

Let me see... 75% of $2000 is $1500.

And 120% of $1500 is $1800.

Now, to figure out the discount his friend got, we gotta see how much less $1800 is than $2000.

That's $200.

So the discount is $200 off the original price.

To find the percentage, we gotta divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

$200 divided by $2000 is 0.1.

0.1 times 100 is 10%.

"Okay, so Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. That's 10 times 4, which is 40 bananas.

If she bought them one by one, it would cost 40 times $0.80, which is $32.00.

But she bought them in bunches for $3.00 each, so that's 10 times $3.00, which is $30.00.

"Well, Harry gets more fence than Sam, so Sam gets less.  

If Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, that means Sam gets 60 less feet than Harry.

Let's see... 100 feet total, and Harry gets more...

Hmm, that's a tough one.

"
"Well, if it grows 8 inches in 4 years, that's like 2 inches every year.

So in 13 years, it'd grow 26 inches.

"
"Okay, so half of the bikes sold were Trekking, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

BMX bikes were 15% of the total, so that's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

That means he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Trekking bikes earned him 150 * $450 = $67500.

BMX bikes earned him 45 * ($500 / 2) = $11250.

MTB bikes earned him 105 * $500 = $52500.

In total, he earned $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $131250.

131250 

"
"Well, the farmer makes 5 bales every hour, so in 6 hours he makes 5 times 6, which is 30 bales.

The truck takes away 3 bales every hour, so in 6 hours it takes 3 times 6, which is 18 bales.

That means there's 30 minus 18 bales left.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has 6 classes plus 2 more, that's 8 classes.

Each class is 40 minutes, so that's 8 times 40, which is 320 minutes a day.

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 times 5, which is 1600 minutes.

On the weekend, he studies for 1600 divided by 16, which is 100 minutes each day.

That's another 100 plus 100, which is 200 minutes.

So in total, he studies 1600 plus 200, which is 1800 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he studies 1800 divided by 60, which is 30 hours.

"
"Okay, so Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, which is 24 feet times 3, so that's 72 feet up.

Then it bounces up to 2/3rds of that, so we gotta do 72 times 2, then divide by 3.

That's 144 divided by 3.

48 



"
"Okay, so the second child is 6 feet plus 2 inches, which is 74 inches.

The third child is 74 inches minus 5 inches, which is 69 inches.

The fourth child is 69 inches plus 3 inches, which is 72 inches. 


72
"
"Well, they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, so they sold 200 bags.

If they sell each bag for $5, then they made 200 times $5.

200 * 5 = 1000


1000
"
"Well, the Allosaurus ate what was left, so before them the velociraptors musta had double that.

That's 270 times 2, which is 540.

And before the velociraptors, the T-Rex ate half, so there musta been double that too.

So 540 times 2 is... 1080!


1080 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much paint Tony needs.

Let's see... the big walls are 10 times 8, that's 80 square feet each.  He's got two of those, so that's 80 times 2, which is 160 square feet.

The little walls are 5 times 8, so that's 40 square feet each. He's got two of those too, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80 square feet.

Altogether, that's 160 plus 80, which is 240 square feet.

Now, each gallon covers 20 square feet, so he needs 240 divided by 20, which is 12 gallons of paint.

If each gallon costs $12, then 12 gallons will cost 12 times 12, which is $144.

"
"Well, Ellen shook up 3 sodas, right? And her brother took one of them.  That leaves 2 shaken sodas.

There's still a bunch of unshaken ones too, but we gotta figure out the chance of her friend grabbin' one of the bad ones.

So, it's 2 shaken sodas out of... lemme see... 11 total sodas left.

2 out of 11... hmm...

"
"Well, one train is goin' twice as fast as the other one. So in one hour, they'd be 60 miles apart, right?

Cause one's goin' 60 miles and the other's goin' 30.

So in three hours, they'd be three times that far apart.

180 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people an hour and works 3 hours a day. That's 2 times 3, which is 6 people a day.

Now, let's see how many days he works. March has 31 days, and then there's 19 days in April, so that's 31 plus 19, which is 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, so we gotta figure out what 20% of 50 is.  That's 50 times 0.20, which is 10 days off.

So he works 50 minus 10 days, which is 40 days.

Finally, he helps 6 people a day, and he works 40 days, so he helps 6 times 40 people.

6 * 40 = 240


240
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

Buses hold lotsa folks, way more than cars.  

Let's see, 12 buses times 35 people each... that's a lotta people!  

And 20 cars times 3 people... that's not as many.

Gotta add 'em all up to see how many folks were at the weddin'.

...

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

The big slide is longer, so it takes longer to go down.

The big slide is 300 feet and you go 60 feet every minute. So that's 300 divided by 60... which is 5 minutes.

The smaller slide is 240 feet and you go 80 feet every minute. So that's 240 divided by 80... which is 3 minutes.

5 minutes minus 3 minutes is... 2 minutes.


2 

"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a half hour lunch every day. That's 30 minutes.

He also takes two 15 minute breaks, so that's 15 plus 15, which is 30 minutes of breaks.

So every day he takes 30 minutes for lunch plus 30 minutes for breaks, for a total of 60 minutes.

That's one hour each day.

Over five days, that's 1 hour times 5 days, which is 5 hours.

"
"Micah ran 8 times 3.5 which is 28 miles.

That means Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card.

Then she took back something that cost $15.00, so now it's $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

The frying pan was $20.00 but 20% off, so that's $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off.

So the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were $30.00 but 10% off, so that's $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off.

So the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now we add up everything: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00



113.00
"
"Okay, so some jellyfish are big and some are small. The big ones can change color, but the little ones stay blue.  Six big ones changed color, and that's a third of all the big ones.

Let's see... if 6 is a third, then there must be 6 times 3, which is 18 big jellyfish.

And if 18 are big, then there are 18 times 5, which is 90 jellyfish in all.


90 

"
"Okay, so Ben is twice as old as Chris, who is 4. That means Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Caroline is three times older than Ben, who is 8. So Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

"
"Well, Lauren wants to live on 40% of her salary when she retires, so that's $100,000 times 0.40, which is $40,000 a year.

She needs to save enough to live on that for 20 years, so that's $40,000 times 20, which is $800,000.

She saves 20% of her paycheck, which is $100,000 times 0.20, or $20,000 a year.

To save $800,000, she needs to work for $800,000 divided by $20,000, which is 40 years.

"
"Okay, so Marty's got a big ol' piece of ribbon, right? He cuts it into four pieces, so each piece is gonna be 100 divided by 4. That's 25 centimeters each.

Then he cuts each of those pieces into five smaller pieces. So we gotta take 25 and divide it by 5.

That's 5 centimeters.


5
"
"Well, if 40% of the school is boys, that means the other 60% must be girls, right?

So, if 40% is 240 boys, then 10% is 240 divided by 4, which is 60.

That means 60% is 60 times 6, which is 360 girls.

360

"Okay, so she bought stuff and then got money off.  

Let's see... 19 plus 26 is 45. Then take away 7...

45 - 7 = 38

"
"Hmm, let's see...

We gotta add up all the heel heights and then divide by the number of ladies wearin' heels.

So, that's 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18 inches total.

And there are six ladies with heels.

18 divided by 6 is... 3.

"
"Well, she wants to walk 9,300 miles in a month, that's a lot! And she wants to walk 125 miles twice a day, so that's 250 miles a day.

Let's see... 

30 days in June times 250 miles a day is 7,500 miles.

That's less than 9,300 miles.

Hmm, so she needs to walk more each day.

9,300 miles minus 7,500 miles is 1,800 miles.

1,800 miles divided by 30 days is 60 miles.


60 

"
"Let's see...

Red balls: 3 balls * $9/ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5/ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3/ball = $75

Now we add all that up: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

"
"Let's see... Pierre wants a quarter, that's like cutting the apples into four parts and takin' one.  Paul wants a third, so that's like cuttin' them into three parts and takin' one.

That's a lot of cuttin'!

12 divided by 4 is 3 for Pierre.

12 divided by 3 is 4 for Paul.

So together they take 3 + 4 = 7 kilograms.

That leaves 12 - 7 = 5 kilograms for Jacques.

"Okay, so Raymond starts with $21. Then he gets more money, so we add that to what he started with: $21 + $11 = $32.

Now he buys stuff, so we take that away: $32 - $5 = $27.

He buys more stuff: $27 - $19 = $8


8 

"
"Let's see... Anna started with $16 and spent $4, so she had $12 left.  She has $2 left now, so she spent $10 on books.

"Well, if it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that's a lot of blinkin'!  

To figure out how long it takes for 459 blinks, we gotta see how many blinks happen in one minute. Then we can figure out how many minutes it takes for 459 blinks.

Let's see... 255 blinks divided by 5 minutes... that's 51 blinks every minute!

Now, if it blinks 51 times every minute, we gotta see how many minutes it takes for 459 blinks.

459 blinks divided by 51 blinks per minute... that's 9 minutes!

"Let's see... I gotta count all the fishies!

He starts with 4 boy guppies and 7 girl guppies, that's 11 guppies. Then he gets 2 more boy guppies and 1 more girl guppy, so now he has 13 guppies.

He starts with 3 boy goldfish and 5 girl goldfish, that's 8 goldfish. Then he gets 2 more boy goldfish and 3 more girl goldfish, so now he has 11 goldfish.

That's 24 fishies in all!

Now, let's see... 7 girl guppies + 5 girl goldfish + 3 more girl goldfish = 15 girl fishies.

And 4 boy guppies + 3 boy goldfish + 2 more boy guppies + 2 more boy goldfish = 11 boy fishies.

15 girl fishies - 11 boy fishies = 4 more girl fishies.

"Well, he drives there and back, so that's double the distance.

To find the distance one way, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

So, distance one way is 70 mph x 2 hours = 140 miles.

Since he drives there and back, the total distance for one visit is 140 miles x 2 = 280 miles.

He visits twice a month, so he drives 280 miles x 2 = 560 miles a month.

560

"
"Let's see...

Two workers make 6 toys an hour, so that's 2 workers * 6 toys/worker = 12 toys an hour.

Another two workers make 4 toys an hour each, so that's 2 workers * 4 toys/worker = 8 toys an hour.

Together, those four workers make 12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys an hour.

They work for 10 hours, so they make 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys.

They needed to make 400 toys and only made 200, so they were short 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys.

They needed 20 more toys to finish the order, so they were short 200 toys - 20 toys = 180 toys.

That means the fifth worker made 180 toys in 10 hours, which is 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour. 


18 

"
"Okay, so Kory's dog is 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that, so it's 60 divided by 4, which is 15 pounds. His other dog is half the weight of Kory's, so that's 60 divided by 2, which is 30 pounds.  

So, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight, we add Elijah's dogs' weight to Kory's dog's weight: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Okay, so Kris got 9 stickers and gave 7 away, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before givin' some to Rob.

That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers.

Luis used half his stickers, so he had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers before givin' some to Kris.

Seth gave half his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers at the start.

"
"Okay, so he has 3 big bags times 10 ounces each, that's 30 ounces total.

Then he has 30 ounces times 30 M&Ms per ounce, so that's 900 M&Ms.

"
"Okay, so the second fastest car is 5 times faster than a normal car, which goes 120 miles per hour. That means the second fastest car goes 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than that, so it goes 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"Let's see... Camden and Sarah did 30 eggs together, and Camden did 12 more than Sarah.  So Sarah musta done 30 - 12 = 18 eggs.

That means Camden did 12 + 18 = 30 eggs.

Arnold and Madeline did the rest, so they did 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together.

Since they both did the same amount, they each did 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

So Camden did 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold.

17 

"
"Okay, so Nik has lots of crayons. He puts 8 crayons in each box, and each crayon weighs the same as one of them boxes.  

Let's see... 200 crayons divided by 8 crayons per box is 25 boxes.

That's a lot of boxes!  

So, 25 boxes times 8 ounces per box is 200 ounces.

And 200 ounces divided by 16 ounces per pound is 12.5 pounds.

That's 80 feet times 80 percent, which is... hmm... 64 feet.

He makes 4-foot logs, so that's 64 divided by 4, which is 16 logs.

Each log gives him 5 planks, so that's 16 times 5, which is 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.20, so he makes 80 times $1.20...

"Well, Grandma walks slower on the beach, so she spends more time there. If she walks for 40 minutes on the beach, and that's 2 miles, then she walks 20 minutes per mile on the beach.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so she walks 10 minutes per mile there.

So, the sidewalk takes her 10 minutes.

That means her whole walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes.

"Well, let's see. Jane saves 4 dollars every week.  She's been doin' that for 8 weeks, so that's 4 times 8, which is 32 dollars.

She wants to have 60 dollars, so she needs 60 minus 32, which is 28 more dollars.

If she saves 4 dollars each week, she'll need 28 divided by 4, which is 7 more weeks.

"Okay, so we gotta add up all the birdies.

First, the three trees with seven birdies each: 3 trees * 7 birdies/tree = 21 birdies

Then the two trees with four birdies each: 2 trees * 4 birdies/tree = 8 birdies

And lastly, the one tree with three birdies: 3 birdies

Now we add all those up: 21 birdies + 8 birdies + 3 birdies = 32 birdies

Milkie Cows brings 20 cows a day, so in three weeks (21 days) they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens a day, so in three weeks they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

That's a lot of animals!

"Okay, lemme see...

So Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, for 18 scoops, Gomer would need 18 / 2 = 9 sets of potatoes.

That means Gomer ate 9 * 3 = 27 potatoes.

"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for a month, that's 3 times 30, which is 90 eggs.

Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 plus 150, which is 240 eggs.

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, so we gotta see how many dozens are in 240.

That's 240 divided by 12, which is 20.

"
"Okay, so there are more women than men on the bus.  

If we think of the ratio like parts of a pie, there are 5 parts men and 9 parts women, making a total of 14 parts.

That means each ""part"" of the pie is 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers per part.

So there were 9 parts women * 6 passengers per part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets every day.

Let's see... he makes more from bouquets, so he probably sells a lot of those.

He sells a lot of sunflowers in bouquets, so I guess he sells a whole bunch of sunflowers in total.

...

After 3 days, Faraday sold 150 sunflowers.

"Okay, so Adam buys rocks for 5 bucks a pop and sells 'em for 7. That's a 2 dollar profit per rock, right?

He's got a hundred bucks, so he can buy 20 rocks.

If he sells 60% of them, that's 12 rocks.

So he makes 12 rocks times 2 dollars profit per rock, which is 24 dollars.

But he spent 100 dollars to start, so he loses 76 dollars.

"Let's see... Jim got 27, and that's 5 more than Carlos. So Carlos got 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Carlos got twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey got 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Altogether they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

If they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than the first song. That means it's 5 minutes plus 60% of 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is (60/100) * 5 = 3 minutes.

So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Linus buys phones for $20 each and sells them for double. That means he makes $20 profit on each phone.

He bought 2 phones on Monday and 4 on Tuesday, so that's 6 phones total.

He makes $20 profit per phone, and he sold 6 phones, so he made 20 x 6 = $120 profit.

"
"Okay, so Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 6 feet tall. Carl's cane is half his height, so his cane is 3 feet long.

"Well, lemme see...

If one bottle gives 20% of the energy a person needs, then one person would need 5 bottles to get all their energy for the day, right?

So for 2300 people, that's 2300 times 5, which is 11,500 bottles.

They make 4200 now, so they need to make 11,500 minus 4200 more.

11500

"
"Okay, so Carla has eight babies, right? And three-quarters wear purple, so that's six babies. One-quarter wear blue, so that's two babies.

Now, one-third of the purple babies wear bows, so that's two babies. And all the blue babies wear bows, so that's two more.

That means four babies wear bows in total.

Out of those four, two are purple.

So, it's like a fifty-fifty chance a baby with a bow is wearing purple.

"
"Let's see... they got a bunch of reports on Monday and Tuesday, then some more on Thursday and Friday.  If we add those together, that's how many they got on those four days.

Then we can take that number away from the total for the whole week to see how many they got on Wednesday.

1907 + 2136 = 4043

5168 - 4043 = 1125


1125 

"
"Okay, so Abraham starts with 80 square meters. He sells half, which is 40 square meters, for $50. Then he sells another quarter, which is 20 square meters, for $30. That leaves him with 20 square meters left.

He sells the last 20 square meters for $3 each, so that's 20 times 3, which is $60.

Now we add up all the money: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140


140 

"
"Okay, so Haley is 26. Half of Haley's age is 26 divided by 2, which is 13. Geb is 10 less than that, so Geb is 13 minus 10.

"
"Well, if he uses two masks each time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, that's two times three, which is six masks a day.

Then, over two days, he'd use six times two, which is twelve masks.

"
"Okay, so Cole hid a whole bunch of eggs.  Lamar found some, and Stacy found more than Lamar. Charlie found some too, and Mei found less than Charlie.

Let's see... 3 dozen eggs is like 3 times 12, which is 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5, and Stacy found twice that, so she found 5 times 2, which is 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 minus 2, which is 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 divided by 2, which is 4 eggs.

Altogether, they found 5 plus 10 plus 8 plus 4, which is 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 minus 27, which is 9 eggs still hidden.

"
"Okay, so John goes to two places with 200 apartments each. That's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last place is 60% bigger than those two, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.

That means the last place has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he goes to 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

He goes to each place 3 times a week, so that's 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He makes $0.40 for each collection, so he makes 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.00 a week.


1248.00 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

A 6-year-old tree makes 50 times 3, which is 150 fruits.

A 7-year-old tree makes 50 times 7, which is 350 fruits.

An 8-year-old tree makes less than a 10-year-old tree, and a 10-year-old tree makes 50 times 20, which is 1000 fruits.

So an 8-year-old tree makes 1000 minus 200, which is 800 fruits.

Now, let's add all the fruits together: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350

"
"Rissa got 3 times more than Ronnie, so she got 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.

They gave the same amount to their sister, so Rissa had 4/5 of 15 left, which is (4/5) * 15 = 12 dollars.

That means Rissa gave 15 - 12 = 3 dollars to her sister.

Ronnie also gave 3 dollars to his sister, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... half the paint is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow.

That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the other colors.

Since there's the same amount of red, white, and purple, they each get 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"
"Okay, so one bedroom is 20 feet times 12 feet, which is 240 square feet.

The living room is 5 times that, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.

Tom has 4 bedrooms, so they take up 240 times 4, which is 960 square feet.

Now we add up the bedrooms and the living room: 960 plus 1200 is 2160.

Finally, we add the rest of the house: 2160 plus 1000 is 3160.


3160
"
"Well, on Tuesday she'd see 3 times 2, which is 6 clouds.

Then on Wednesday, she'd see 6 times 2, which is 12 clouds.

Thursday would be 12 times 2, so that's 24 clouds.

And on Friday, she'd see 24 times 2, which is 48 clouds.

So, to find the total, we gotta add up all the clouds she saw each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"
"Hmm, 20% more pods means there's more in the box.  Gotta figure out how many more... 20% of 100 is... lemme see... 20 outta every 100, so that's 20 more pods.

So the big box has 100 plus 20, which is 120 pods.

If each pod does one load and the box costs the same, then you get 120 loads for $12.

That means for every dollar you get 120 divided by 12, which is 10 loads.


10 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

He starts with 1000 dollars and each bill is 20 dollars, so that's 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of those to pay a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

He triples his money, so he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Each of those bills is worth 20 dollars, so he has 60 * 20 = 1200 dollars.

Now he changes them to 5 dollar bills.  That's 1200 / 5 = 240 bills.

"
"Team B scored 2 less goals than team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals they scored in the first half, so they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

In total, team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in the match.

Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in the match.

Together, they scored 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"
"Well, he started with 5 inches of chalk and used up 45% of it, so that's... hmm... 5 times 0.45...  let me see... that's 2.25 inches gone.

That leaves him with 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

He needs to stop using it when it gets to 2 inches, so he has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches to use up.

He uses 20% each day, so that's 0.20 times the length of the chalk.

So, 0.75 divided by 0.20 is... 3.75.

He can use it for 3 whole days.

"
"Let's see...

One-third of the girls is 12 / 3 = 4 girls on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys is 12 / 4 = 3 boys on varsity.

That's 4 + 3 = 7 students on varsity.

There are 12 + 12 = 24 students total.

So, 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Okay, so the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth capped.

That means the dentist fixed a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

Now, to find the percentage, we gotta do some dividin'. 15 teeth fixed outta 30 total teeth is 15/30, which is 0.5.

Multiply that by 100 to get the percentage: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

"Well, lemme see... Mr. Marcellus bought a whole lotta milk, 4000 gallons!  But some of it went bad, 2 outta every 5 gallons. That's a lot of spoiled milk!

So, first we gotta figure out how much milk went bad.  Two-fifths of 4000... hmm... that's like cutting the milk into 5 piles and taking 2 of them.

Let's see... 4000 divided by 5 is 800. And then 800 times 2 is 1600 gallons of milk went bad.

Now, each gallon cost $3.50, so we gotta multiply that by the bad milk. 1600 times $3.50...  

That's a lot of numbers!

1600 * 3.50 = 5600

"Let's see... he's got $27,000 and three schools. So each school gets $9,000, right?

Now, he can get 100 books for $500.  So if he has $9,000, how many sets of 100 books can he buy?

Hmm... $9,000 divided by $500 is 18.

So he can buy 18 sets of 100 books for each school.

That means each school gets 1800 books!

1800

"Let's see... 850 kilos of coal, and each bag has 50 kilos. So he needs 850 divided by 50 bags, which is 17 bags.

If each bag costs $18, then 17 bags will cost 17 times $18.

17 * 18 = 306

"
"Let's see... 6 friends times 6 slices of cheese is 36 slices. And 6 friends times 4 slices of pepperoni is 24 slices.

So that's 36 cheese slices and 24 pepperoni slices.

Now, 36 cheese slices divided by 12 slices per cheese pizza is 3 cheese pizzas.

And 24 pepperoni slices divided by 8 slices per pepperoni pizza is 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"Let's see... Sam ran 3 miles three times, so that's 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

"Well, Jay makes snowballs pretty fast, but they melt quick too!  

Let's see... he makes 20 in a whole hour, that's like 60 minutes. So every 15 minutes he makes a bunch, but then some melt.

Hmm, gotta figure out how many melt in an hour... 60 minutes divided by 15 is 4, so 2 melt every 15 minutes means 8 melt in an hour.

So he makes 20 but loses 8, that's 12 more snowballs every hour.

To get to 60, he needs 40 more (60 - 20 = 40).

If he gets 12 more every hour, it'll take him a little over 3 hours.

"
"Well, if John is 28 now and Digimon came out 20 years ago, that means John was 8 years old when Digimon first came out.

If John was twice as old as Jim then, that means Jim was half John's age.

"Okay, so they used less bandages on the second day.  

They used half a pack on the third day, that's 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

They had 78 left and used 25, so before the third day they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

They ordered two packs on the third day, that's 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.

So before ordering more on the third day they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages.

They used 38 on the first day and ordered 50, so they started with 3 + 38 = 41 bandages.

"Let's see... she works 7.5 hours a day, and she works 6 days a week. So that's 7.5 times 6, which is 45 hours a week.

Then we gotta multiply that by how many weeks are in April, which is 4. So that's 45 times 4, which is 180 hours.

Now, she makes $1.50 for every hour she works, so we multiply 180 by 1.50. That's 270.

And don't forget, she gets an extra $10 for coming to work every day!

So, 270 plus 10 is...

* Twice the 40 folks came later, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80.
* And then 3 times the first 50 folks came, so that's 50 times 3, which is 150.

"Okay, so John gets 10 bottles of scotch for 600 bucks. That means each bottle costs 60 bucks.

Now, he gets twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 bottles.

Cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle costs 60 plus half of 60, which is 30. So cognac costs 90 bucks a bottle.

He buys 20 bottles of cognac at 90 bucks a pop, so that's 20 times 90, which is 1800 bucks.

All together, he spends 600 on scotch plus 1800 on cognac, for a total of 2400 bucks.

"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 times 2 which is 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The next day he planted 10 more White Oak, so that's 20 plus 10, which is 30 White Oak trees.

For the Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, so that's 40 divided by 4 which is 10 more trees.  He planted 40 plus 10, which is 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine + 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 140 trees

"Okay, so first we gotta figure out how many fish have red stripes.  

One-third of 66 is like splittin' it into three equal groups. So, 66 divided by 3 is 22 fish with red stripes.

That leaves 66 minus 22, which is 44 fish without red stripes.

Now, 5 out of every 11 of those fish have blue stripes.  So, we gotta do 44 divided by 11, which is 4. Then we multiply that by 5, 'cause 5 out of 11 have blue stripes. That's 20 fish with blue stripes.

So, 22 fish with red stripes plus 20 fish with blue stripes makes a total of...

"Let's see... Amy had two palettes with four colors each, so that's two times four, which is eight colors.

Then she had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's three times six, which is eighteen colors.

That's eight plus eighteen, which is twenty-six colors in total.

Her sister took one palette, so that's four less colors.

So she had twenty-six minus four, which is twenty-two colors.

Then she used half the colors from one makeup set, which is six divided by two, or three colors.

So she has twenty-two minus three, which is nineteen colors left.

Now, he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  

60% of $100,000...

"Hmm, so Trinity buys magazines for $72 and sells them for more.  

Let's see... 11/8 is bigger than 1, so she's sellin' them for more than she paid.

If she sells them for 11/8 of what she paid, that means she sells them for 11/8 times $72.

Gotta multiply those together... 11 times 72 is 792, and 8 times 72 is 576.

So 792 divided by 576 is...  $1.375.

That means she sells each magazine for $1.375.

Now to find her profit, we gotta subtract what she paid from what she sells them for.

$1.375 minus $1.00... that's $0.375 profit per magazine.

"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier takes out a lotta water.

Low setting is 1 liter a day. Medium is double that, so 2 liters a day. High is double medium, so that's 4 liters a day.

He ran it on low for 3 days, so that's 1 liter a day times 3 days, which is 3 liters.

Then medium for 3 days, so that's 2 liters a day times 3 days, which is 6 liters.

Finally, high for 5 days, so that's 4 liters a day times 5 days, which is 20 liters.

Now we add it all up: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

"Okay, so John's classes are smaller than Ali's. Ali's class can hold 120 kids. John's classes are 1/8 the size of that, so each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 kids.

Since John has two classes, they can hold 15 * 2 = 30 kids.

That means both schools can hold 120 + 30 = 150 kids.

"Okay, so Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2%.  That's like 2 dollars for every 100 dollars he borrowed.

So the interest is $300 times 2%, which is $6.

That means he owes $306 total.

He's already paid $25 a month for 11 months, so that's $25 times 11, which is $275.

So, in the twelfth month, he needs to pay $306 minus the $275 he already paid.

Now, thirty percent of those are red... so that's 432 times 0.30... which is 129.6.

Then at the next stop, 3/4 of the 40 people got on, so that's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.

Now there's 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

At the third stop, the number of people doubled, so now there's 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"Well, lemme see... Pauline goes three times a year, and it costs two dollars each time. So that's three times two, which is six dollars a year.

She goes for five years, so that's six times five, which is thirty dollars.

She goes for three more years, so that's eighteen times three, which is fifty-four dollars.

In total, she spent thirty plus fifty-four dollars.

"Well, lemme see here...

They got 10 kids in each grade, but only 8 can go in the room at once. So they gotta do it in groups.

There's 4 grades, so that's 10 kids times 4 grades, which is 40 kids total.

If 8 kids go at a time, that's 40 kids divided by 8 kids per group, which is 5 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes, so 5 groups times 45 minutes is... 225 minutes.

225 



"
"Let's see... John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 times 20, which is 80 dollars.

He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 dollars.

To find the total, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: 80 plus 20 is 100 dollars.


100 

"
"Let's see... If we cut the board into two pieces, and one piece is four times longer than the other, that means we gotta split it into five parts.

Think of it like this:

* One part is the short piece.
* Four parts make up the long piece.

So, each part is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The long piece is made of four parts, so it's 8 feet/part * 4 parts = 32 feet long.

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

10 

"
"Let's see... five windows times 35 inches each... that's 175 inches.  And he needs twice that much...

175 * 2 = 350 

350
"
"Okay, so you gotta pay more at first, then it gets cheaper.

First 16 minutes cost 16 times 25 cents, which is 4 bucks.

The rest of the call is 36 minus 16, so that's 20 minutes.

Those 20 minutes cost 20 times 20 cents, which is 4 bucks.

So the whole call costs 4 plus 4 bucks.

"
"Twice the rain from Monday is 2 inches times 2, which is 4 inches.

One more inch than that is 4 inches plus 1 inch, which is 5 inches.


5 

"
"Let's see... she needs enough for everyone to have two treats, so that's five times two, which is ten treats.

If she made two less brownies than three times the cupcakes, that means the brownies are like the cupcakes plus two more cupcakes.

So, ten treats minus the extra two from the brownies is eight treats.

That means she made eight cupcakes.

8 

"
"Okay, so a manicure and pedicure together cost $35 + $40 = $75.

That's before the discount.  20% of $75 is $15, so the discount is $15.

That means the manicure and pedicure together cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, she wants nail art on all 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3, so that's 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the nail art cost to the manicure and pedicure cost: $60 + $30 = $90.



90
"
"Okay, so she gets 3 magazines times 12 issues each, that's 36 magazines.

Then she gets 6 more from one magazine.

The last one is tricky. 6 times 4 is 24.

So that's 36 + 6 + 24.

36 + 6 + 24 = 66


66
"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings, and that's 12 less than Shelley.  So Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

31 

"
"Okay, so it went up by 80% of 40 bucks, so that's like 40 times 0.8, which is 32 bucks more.

So in December it cost 40 plus 32, which is 72 bucks.

Then it went down by half, so that's 72 divided by 2, which is 36 bucks.


36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson. That's 4 lessons times $80, which is $320.

Now for the veteran lessons. He takes 25% off his normal price, so that's $80 times 0.25, which is $20 off.  That means he charges $80 - $20 = $60 for each veteran lesson.

Two lessons at $60 each is $60 times 2, which is $120.

Finally, we add up the money from the regular lessons and the veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.


$440 

"
"Gotta add up all the numbers then divide by how many there are.

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

There are 9 numbers.

630 / 9 = 70


70
"
"Eve started with 20 pomelos and now has 1/4 of that left.  That means she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left.

So she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

"
"Okay, so Walter ate some apples, then gave some to his sister.  Let's see...

He ate 2/5 of 60 apples, which is like saying (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.

That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

His sister got 25% of those, so she got (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

That means Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

He sold those for $3 each, so he made 27 * $3 = $81.


81 

"
"If 9 novels is three quarters of the novels she wrote this year, that means she wrote a whole year's worth of novels plus another quarter this year.

So, to find out how many she wrote this year, we gotta figure out what one whole is.

If 9 is three quarters, then one quarter is 9 divided by 3.

9 divided by 3 is 3.

That means she wrote a whole year's worth, which is 3 times 4, or 12 novels.

12 

"
"Well, if he drives for 3 whole days, that's like 3 times 24 hours, which is 72 hours.

Then you gotta multiply that by his speed, 50 km per hour. So, 72 times 50 is 3600 km.

Now, to find the percentage, you divide the distance he drove, 3600 km, by the total distance, 6000 km, and multiply by 100.

That's 3600 divided by 6000, times 100, which is 60%.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times that, so he used 6 times 5 which is 30 grapes. That's a lot of grapes!

The pies used 12 grapes each and there were 4 pies, so that's 12 times 4 which is 48 grapes.

So in total, there were 6 + 30 + 48 grapes.


6 + 30 + 48

"Well, if 13 teachers were sick, that means they weren't at school.  So you gotta take the total number of teachers and subtract the sick ones. Then you add in the substitute teachers.

"
"Okay, so Bud buys pasta for a dollar.  He spends three dollars on cheddar, and twice that on gruyere, so that's six dollars.  That's a total of seven dollars each time he makes it.

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he makes it 52 times.

7 dollars times 52 weeks is... hmm... let me see...

364 



"
"Okay, so they gotta clean 80 rooms in 5 days. That's 16 rooms a day.

Each room takes 15 minutes, so that's 16 times 15, which is 240 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is 4 hours.

They work 8 hours a day, so they spend 4 out of 8 hours cleaning.

That's half their day.

50 



"
"Okay, so the middle shelves hold 10 books each, and there are two of them, so that's 10 + 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, so it holds 10 x 2 = 20 books.

The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Altogether, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Let's see... five dozens of eggs is like five times twelve, so that's sixty eggs.

She spent 5 times $2.40, which is $12.00 on the eggs.

She sells three eggs for a dollar, so she can sell sixty eggs for twenty dollars.

That means she makes $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00 profit.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Skyler has a whole bunch of hats! Half of them are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that aren't red.

Three-fifths of those are blue, so that's 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

That means there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Okay, so the jerky is on sale for $3.00 less, so it costs $15.00.

Then you gotta divide the price by how many sticks there are.

"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the questions right on both tests.

Let's see, she got 60% right on the first test, which is 70 questions times 60%, that's 42 questions.

Now she needs to figure out how many questions she needs to get right in total.  

If she needs to get 70% right on both tests, and there are 70 + 40 = 110 questions total, she needs to get 110 times 70% which is 77 questions right.

So, she already got 42 right, so she needs 77 - 42 = 35 more questions right.

"Let's see... she makes a bunch of strawberry ones, and then way more blueberry ones.

"
"Let's see... she plays 40 games a year and scores 21 points each game. So that's 40 times 21 points, which is 840 points every year.

She's been playing for four years, so we gotta multiply that by 4.

840 times 4 is... 3360

"
"He dropped half of his marbles, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3, so he was missing 5 - 3 = 2 marbles.

He had 3 marbles and got rid of 1, so he has 3 - 1 = 2 marbles left.


2 

"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  For every two people that come in, he sells one car. So he needs 15 cars times 2 people = 30 people to come in.

Now, for every 25 calls, one person comes in. So he needs to make 30 people times 25 calls = 750 calls.


750 

"
"Let's see...

We got one flashlight for each person, so that's 4 flashlights.

Then we got two flashlights for each room, and there's 8 rooms, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16 flashlights.

That's a lot of flashlights!

Now for the candles... half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 rooms.

So that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 medium candles.

Altogether, that's 16 small candles plus 20 medium candles, which is 36 candles.

So, we got 4 flashlights plus 16 flashlights, which is 20 flashlights.

And we got 36 candles.

20 + 36 = 56

"Okay, so the first side takes 5 minutes.

The second and third sides each take 10 minutes (twice as long as the first).

The last two sides each take 2.5 minutes (half as long as the first).

"
"Okay, so there's half as many robots as helmets, which is 20 helmets / 2 = 10 robots.

And there's half as many helmets as footballs, so there's 20 helmets * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total, we add them all up: 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 items.

70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That means he can do 6 hours times 60 minutes an hour, which is 360 minutes of work a day.  Then we gotta see how many 15 minute calls fit in 360 minutes.  That's 360 divided by 15, which is 24 calls a day.

Now, he works 5 days a week, so he does 24 calls a day times 5 days, which is 120 calls.

"Well, the new varnish takes 5 more minutes to dry than the old one.

So for 6 paintings, that's 5 minutes extra per painting times 6 paintings.

5 * 6 = 30

"Okay, so some plants need a half cup, some need a whole cup, and some need a quarter cup.

Let's see... 4 plants times half a cup is 2 cups.

8 plants times 1 cup is 8 cups.

That's 10 cups already.

Now we got 20 plants total, and 4 plus 8 is 12. So 20 minus 12 is 8 plants left.

Those 8 plants need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 times 0.25 which is 2 cups.

So, 10 plus 2 is 12 cups.


12 

"
"Okay, so Phineas has to go 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, he hops 20 yards every minute, so that'll take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

In the water, he swims 10 yards every minute, so that'll take him 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

So, in total, it'll take him 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

15 

"
"Well, lemme see... he needs 56 sticks and each box has 8.  So that's 56 divided by 8... which is 7 boxes.

If each box is $2.00, then 7 boxes would be 7 times 2...

7 * 2 = 14

"Well, the other phones cost half as much as the main one, so they each cost $10.

There are four extra phones, so that's $10 x 4 = $40.

"
"Let's see... 5 blouses times $5.00 is $25.00.  The skirt is $6.00.  And the pants are $8.00 times 2, so that's $16.00.  So each week she spends $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00.

Now for 5 weeks, it's $47.00 times 5.

235.00

"Well, if he's 2.5 times faster, that means he can talk 150 times 2.5 which is 375 words a minute!

That's mighty fast!

So, he's gotta say 10 pages times 450 words per page, which is 4500 words total.

Now, if he says 375 words every minute, we gotta see how many minutes it takes to say 4500 words.

4500 divided by 375 is 12.

375 



"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day.

Then 50 + 20 = 70 people on the second day.

The third day had twice the people from the second day, so 70 x 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500

"Okay, so Tim needs 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and that's 4 cups of lemon juice.  That means he needs 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Now, Allen wants one gallon that's extra tart, so that's like needing 2 cups of lemon juice for just that one gallon.  That's 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 more lemons.

So, in total, Tim needs 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

36 

"
"Okay, so we got them German Shepherds eatin' 5 big ol' kilograms each, and them Bulldogs eatin' 3.

That's 3 Shepherds times 5 kilograms, which is 15 kilograms.

And 2 Bulldogs times 3 kilograms, that's 6 kilograms.

So, all together that's 15 plus 6, which is 21 kilograms a day.

Now, for a whole week, we gotta multiply that by 7 days.

21 times 7 is... 147!

"
"Let's see... 10 animals with 2 legs each is 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.

80 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so that's 4 times 2 which is 8 yellow blocks.

That means there are 4 plus 8, which is 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.

20 

"
"Well, he drove west for 5 hours at 18 mph, so that's 5 times 18, which is 90 miles.

Then he drove east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so that's 8 times 18, which is 144 miles.

Since he drove further east than west, he's gotta be further east from his house.

So, 144 minus 90 is...

54 

"
"Okay, so Gary's boat lost 30% of its value the first year. That's like 9000 times 0.30 which is 2700 dollars less it's worth.

So after the first year it's worth 9000 - 2700 = 6300 dollars.

The second year it loses another 30%, so that's 6300 times 0.30 which is 1890 dollars less.

Now it's worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410 dollars.

The third year it loses 20%, so that's 4410 times 0.20 which is 882 dollars less.

That means after three years it's worth 4410 - 882 = 3528 dollars. 


3528 

"
"Okay, so there's 54 red candies and twice that many orange, so that's 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies.

Then there's half as many yellow as red, so that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies in total.

If there's 232 candies all together, then there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

43 

"
"Okay, so Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80.  That's 3 times $80, which is $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 times 0.10, which is $8.

She took the bus 7 times, so that's 7 times $8, which is $56.

To find the total cost, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost: $240 + $56 = $296.

"
"Well, Dallas had some marbles and then lost some.  We gotta figure out how many he had before he lost some.

He had 21 marbles and lost 4, so he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before.

Mazie gave out 52 marbles total, and Dallas got 25, so Darla got 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"Okay, so the car is heavy, and he's got stuff and kids in it too.  Gotta add all that up first.

1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 75 pounds (kid 1) + 75 pounds (kid 2) = 1600 pounds total

"Okay, so Avery needs 12 place settings.  Each one has a big plate, a little plate, and a bowl.

The big plates cost 6 bucks each, so 12 plates cost 6 times 12, which is 72 dollars.

The little plates cost 4 bucks each, so 12 of them cost 4 times 12, which is 48 dollars.

The bowls cost 5 bucks each, so 12 bowls cost 5 times 12, which is 60 dollars.

Now we gotta add all that up: 72 + 48 + 60 = 180 dollars.


180

"Let's see... five pigs eatin' four pounds twice a day... that's eight pounds a day per pig.

So all five pigs eat 40 pounds a day.

In a week, that's 40 pounds a day times seven days... that's 280 pounds.

If he started with 300 pounds and they ate 280 pounds...

300 - 280 = 20

"
"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people times 2 hot dogs each. That's 40 hot dogs.

He already has 4, so he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Each pack has 6, so he needs 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so 6 packs will cost 6 * $2 = $12. 


$12
"
"Okay, so Frances makes money from sellin' cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so that's 20 times 2, which is $40.

Then she sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so that's 40 times 1, which is $40.

So she makes $40 + $40 = $80 from sellin' stuff.

But she spends money on trays too. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so that's 5 times 4, which is $20.

So she has $80 - $20 = $60 left.


60 

"
"Okay, so there were 5 kids at first. Then each kid got a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.

Then on the third street, each kid got 2 more friends. So that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids.

But then the first 5 kids left, so we gotta take 5 away from 20.

20 minus 5 is 15.

"Let's see... a quarter is worth 25 cents.  A nickel is worth 5 cents, and he has two of them, so that's 10 cents.  A dime is worth 10 cents, and he has 7 of them, so that's 70 cents.

25 + 10 + 70 = 105

"
"Let's see...  

The older brother is twice as old as the younger one, so he's 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

All the sisters are 16, so that's 16 * 3 = 48 years for all of them.

Now, let's add up all their ages: 24 + 12 + 48 = 84

"Okay, so she meditates twice a day for 15 minutes each time. That's 15 + 15 = 30 minutes a day.

And she does yoga for an hour, which is 60 minutes, 5 days a week.

So that's 30 minutes of meditation + 60 minutes of yoga = 90 minutes a day.

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so in a week she does 90 minutes a day * 7 days = 630 minutes.

Over 4 weeks, that's 630 minutes a week * 4 weeks = 2520 minutes.

"A dozen has 12 things in it, so a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more than 36 seeds, which is 36 / 2 = 18 more seeds.

So a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Altogether, there are 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

90 

"
"Okay, so Timothy has three times the pens George has. That's 18 times 3, which is 54 pens.

Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 divided by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

"
"Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne is 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall.

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before summer she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall.

67 

"
"Let's see... they make 5000 bars a day, and they sell 'em for 2 bucks each. So that's 5000 times 2, which is 10,000 dollars a day.

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, that's 14 days.

So, 10,000 dollars a day times 14 days...

140,000 



"
"Okay, so Jake gets two shirts. One shirt is full price, so that's $8. The other shirt is half off, so that's $8 / 2 = $4.

The shoes are $40, but they're 40% off, so that's $40 * 0.40 = $16 off. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

So, the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12.

All together, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.

36 

"
"Let's see... Ryan gets $6 a week for 3 weeks, so that's 6 times 3 which is 18 dollars.

Then he buys ice cream for himself and 3 friends, that's 4 people in total. Each cone costs $1.25, so that's 4 times $1.25 which is $5.

He started with $18 and spent $5, so he has $18 minus $5 which is $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 divided by $6.50 which is 2 tickets.

"
"Let's see... Ellen spent a hundred bucks on leggings and five on a picture thing. That's a hundred and five. Lani got some sunglasses for thirty dollars and two of them bathrobes, which cost a hundred each. So that's two hundred for the robes. Thirty plus two hundred is two hundred and thirty.

Now we gotta add Ellen's stuff and Lani's stuff together. A hundred and five plus two hundred and thirty is...

328 

"
"Okay, so Tim needs stuff to make his mix. Passion fruit is $6 a pound and he uses 2 pounds, so that's 6 times 2 which is $12.  Jackfruit is $8 a pound and he uses 1.5 pounds, so that's 8 times 1.5 which is $12.  Honey is $10 a pound and he uses 2 pounds, so that's 10 times 2 which is $20.

So, all the stuff to make one jar costs 12 plus 12 plus 20 which is $44.

He sells each jar for $50 and it costs $44 to make, so he makes $50 minus $44 which is $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 times 10 which is $60.


60 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much money Justin has.

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 32 quarters is 32 times 25, which is 800 cents.
* Dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 95 dimes is 95 times 10, which is 950 cents.
* Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 120 nickels is 120 times 5, which is 600 cents.
* Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 750 pennies is just 750 cents.

Now we add up all the cents: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents.

There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide 3100 by 100: 3100 divided by 100 is 31.

"
"Okay, so Janet buys ice cream for $3.50. Then two movie tickets cost $7.50 each, so that's $7.50 times 2, which is $15.  And the bracelet is $8.50.

Let's add all that up: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Now we gotta see how much money she has left. Her parents gave her $40 and she spent $27, so we do $40 - $27.

"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week.

He makes 3 cars a day times $4 a car, so that's $12 a day.

He works 5 days a week times $12 a day, so that's $60 a week.

Two weeks is double a week, so he makes $60 times 2, which is $120.


120 

"
"Okay, let's see...

He starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies.

He eats one of each, so that's 9-1=8 oatmeal, 4-1=3 chocolate chip, and 5-1=4 sugar cookies.

Then he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, so 8-2=6 oatmeal cookies left.

He gives away 2 sugar cookies, so 4-2=2 sugar cookies left.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, so that's 6+4=10 oatmeal, 3+4=7 chocolate chip, and 2+4=6 sugar cookies.

Let's add them all up: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23


23 

"
"Let's see... half of 12 is 6.

So he'd sell 6 for $5 each, that's 6 times 5, which is 30 dollars.

Then he'd sell the other 6 for $7 each, so that's 6 times 7, which is 42 dollars.

30 plus 42 is...

72


72
"
"Okay, so the dog digs a lot of holes! Let's see...

He digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 times 14... which is 84 holes.

Then every day Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more. So that means Nate really fills 9 minus 6, which is 3 holes a day.

To fill 84 holes at 3 holes a day, that's 84 divided by 3... which is 28 days.

There are 7 days in a week, so 28 days is 28 divided by 7... which is 4 weeks.

"
"Well, if Butler High School gets 3/4 the students Norman High School does, that means they get less.  

To find out how many less, we gotta do some figurin'.

Three-quarters of 4000 is... lemme see... 3 times 4000 is 12000, and then we divide that by 4...

That's 3000 students at Butler High.

Now we gotta see the difference. 4000 minus 3000...

1000


1000
"
"Let's see... they made a bunch of cookies, huh?  

7995 total cookies minus the rainbow and oatmeal ones... that's gotta be the chocolate chip ones!

"
"Igor messed up a bit! He only got 8 test tubes 'cause that's half of 16. And he got 16 Petri dishes 'cause that's 2 more than 14. So that's 8 plus 16 plus 7 beakers, which is 31 things. But he only put 29 on the bench, so he lost 2 beakers.


2 

"
"Let's see... he's got 4 tables times 4 legs each, that's 16 legs.

And each leg needs 2 screws, so that's 16 times 2, which is 32 screws.

He started with 40 screws and needs 32, so he'll have 8 left over.

"
"Well, if there's twice as many eggs in the second basket, that's 10 times 2, which is 20 eggs.

So, you got 10 plus 20...

20 

"
"Okay, so Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300. So Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180


2180 

"
"Well, if Aaron's twice as fast as Vanessa, but she runs twice as far, that means they both take the same amount of time.

16 

"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he's got 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 times 200 feet of line, which is 600 feet.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 minus 6 feet.

594 

"
"Okay, so they get 6 people each night, and those people each get 2 meals at $5 a piece.  That's 6 times 2 times $5, which is $60.  Then they get a $5 bottle of wine, so that's $60 plus $5, which is $65.

They make $65 each night, and they're open 2 nights a week, so that's $65 times 2, which is $130.


130 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He made 25% more money than he spent, right? So first gotta figure out how much extra he made.

That's 80 bucks times 25%, which is... lemme see... 20 bucks!

So he made 80 plus 20, that's 100 bucks total.

Now he sold 50 watermelons, so each one cost... 100 divided by 50...

"
"Dora is gonna be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now.

James is twice as old as Dora, so he's 18.

John was 19 when James was born, so John is 37 now.

John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so the youngest son is 5 now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8.

8
"
"Well, there's 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, so she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange every 4 minutes, so she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

5 

"
"Okay, so the radiator was 80% off, so that means he saved 400 * 0.80 = $320.

That means the radiator cost him 400 - 320 = $80.

The mechanic cost him 3 * 50 = $150.

So in total he paid 80 + 150 = $230.

230 

"
"Let's see... chickens got two legs, cows got four.  

If all the animals were chickens, that'd be 20 times 2, which is 40 legs.

That's not enough legs, so gotta be some cows.

Each cow is two extra legs, so we need 30 more legs.

That's 30 divided by 2, which is 15 cows.

So, if there's 15 cows, there's 5 chickens.

5 

"
"Let's see... they got 7 pizzas and 4 friends want to share.  That's a lotta pizza!

Each pizza has 8 slices, so they got 7 times 8 slices, which is 56 slices.

If they split it evenly, each friend gets 56 slices divided by 4 friends.

56 / 4 = 14
