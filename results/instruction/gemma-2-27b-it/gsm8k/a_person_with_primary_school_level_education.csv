"First, we need to figure out how much the repairs increased the house's value.

We do that by multiplying the original price by the percentage increase: $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000

That means the repairs added $120,000 to the house's value.

Now we add that to the original price to find the final value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Finally, we subtract the total cost (buying price plus repairs) from the final value to find the profit: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000

"Okay, so every other glass is cheaper. That means half of the glasses will cost $5 and the other half will cost 60% of $5.

Let's figure out what 60% of $5 is:

60/100 * $5 = $3

So, half of the glasses cost $5 and half cost $3.

Kylar is buying 16 glasses, so that's 8 glasses at each price.

8 glasses * $5/glass = $40

8 glasses * $3/glass = $24

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know Jerry gets 42 eggs every day.

Let's say Jerry has ""R"" red chickens and ""W"" white chickens.

We know W = R + 2 (because he has two more white chickens than red ones).

Red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so they lay 3R eggs a day.

White chickens lay 5 eggs each, so they lay 5W eggs a day.

All together, that's 3R + 5W eggs a day.

We also know that 3R + 5W = 42

Now we can use the fact that W = R + 2 to solve for R.

Let's put (R + 2) in for W in our equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Now we can solve for R:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

8R + 10 = 42

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about the leaks:** Both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in water between them is changing because of the leaks.

* **The difference:**  Since the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago and now has four times as much, that means it lost less water than the small pool in those 4 minutes.

* **Figure out the lost water:** The big pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

* **The small pool lost more:** Since the big pool now has four times as much water, the small pool must have lost more than 16 gallons.

* **Let's try some numbers:** If the small pool started with 16 gallons, it would be empty now.  If it started with 20 gallons, it would have 4 gallons left.

* **Check if it works:** If the small pool started with 20 gallons and lost 16 gallons, the big pool would have started with 40 gallons and lost 16 gallons, leaving it with 24 gallons. That's four times the amount in the small pool!

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'x' be the number of players on defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many players on offense as defense, so there are 2 * x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as defense, so there are x / 2 players on special teams.

* **Total:** The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Now we can solve for x:

* **Combine like terms:** 3.5x = 105

"Let's figure this out!

First, the vaccines cost 2 x $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so let's say the total bill is ""x"".  We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check: $40 + 0.60x = x

Let's solve for x:

* Subtract 0.60x from both sides: $40 = 0.40x
* Divide both sides by 0.40: $100 = x

So the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 and the bill is $100, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

Since we only have 54 students, we need to find the difference: 108 students - 54 students = 54 more students.

Since each group has 9 students, we need 54 students / 9 students per group = 6 more groups.

"Let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how many enemies and berries each girl got. We don't know how many Emma got, so let's say she jumped on 'x' enemies and collected 'y' berries.

Ava jumped on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumped on x + 8 enemies.

Ava also collected 3 more berries than Emma, so she collected y + 3 berries.

Now let's calculate their points from enemies:

* Emma: x enemies * 10 points/enemy = 10x points
* Ava: (x + 8) enemies * 10 points/enemy = 10x + 80 points

Let's calculate their points from berries:

* Emma: y berries * 5 points/berry = 5y points
* Ava: (y + 3) berries * 5 points/berry = 5y + 15 points

Emma finished the level with some time left, let's say 't' seconds. Ava finished 4 seconds slower, so she finished with t - 4 seconds.

Let's calculate their points from the timer:

* Emma: t seconds * 30 points/second = 30t points
* Ava: (t - 4) seconds * 30 points/second = 30t - 120 points

To find the difference in their scores, we need to add up all their points and then subtract Ava's total from Emma's total.

Emma's total score: 10x + 5y + 30t
Ava's total score: 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 = 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

First, the four students drank a total of 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

Then, the 16 students drank a total of 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

That means all the students drank 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Since there were 10 quarts left, there were 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts at the beginning.

There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so there were 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons.

And she has way more pictures than the package includes! She has 20 pictures and the package only includes 10, so she needs 10 extra pictures installed (20 - 10 = 10).

"Let's try to figure this out!

We know that Sofie has more books than Anne, and Anne has fewer books than Fawn. That means Fawn has the most books.

Let's use letters to help us:

*  F = Fawn's books
*  A = Anne's books
*  S = Sofie's books

We know:

* S + A + F = 85 (They have 85 books together)
* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Let's put the information about Anne and Sofie into the first equation:

(F - 12) + 25 + (F - 12) + F = 85

Now let's combine the F's:

3F + 1 = 85

Let's get rid of the 1:

3F = 84

So, (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x = 100

Combining like terms: 4x + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4x = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: x = 20

Now we know John is 20 years old.

Peter's age is 2x + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, so it cooled it by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
* **High setting:** It cooled the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, so it cooled it by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
* **Total cooling:** In total, the air conditioner cooled the room by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Warming up:** The room warmed up 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.
* **Final temperature:** The room ended up 18 degrees cooler minus 4 degrees warmer, for a total of 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler.

"Let's figure this out step by step!

* **Plane 1:** The first plane flies to Greece most of the time, which is three-quarters of its flights. That means it flies to other places for the other quarter.

* **Splitting the rest:**  The flights that aren't to Greece are split between France and Germany. So, each of those gets half of that quarter.

* **Plane 2:** The second plane only flies to Poland, and it does that 44 times a day. That's only half the number of flights the first plane takes.

* **Plane 1's total flights:** Since the second plane's 44 flights are half of the first plane's, the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 flights.

* **Flights to other places:** The first plane flies to places other than Greece for 88 / 4 = 22 flights.

* **Flights to France:** Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

* **Total howl time:** All three wolves howl for a total of 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

* **Let's use letters:**

   *  Let 'x' be the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
   *  The first set had 'x + 4' balls.
   *  The third set had 'x / 2' balls.

* **Total balls:** x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

* **Combine like terms:** (2.5x) + 4 = 19

* **Subtract 4 from both sides:** 2.5x = 15

* **Divide both sides by 2.5:** x = 6

* **First set balls:** x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"If 40% of the school is boys, that means 100% - 40% = 60% are girls.

To find out how many students are in the whole school, we can set up a proportion:

40% / 240 boys = 100% / x students

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

40% * x = 240 boys * 100%

Divide both sides by 40% to isolate x:

x = (240 boys * 100%) / 40%

x = 600 students

Since 60% of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls:

600 students * 60% = 360 girls

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

* **Blue rope:** The blue rope is shorter than the yellow rope by 7 centimeters.

* **Red rope:** The red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.

* **Total length:** All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To find the length of the red rope, we need to figure out the length of the blue rope first. Then we can find the length of the red rope.

Let's use ""x"" to represent the length of the yellow rope.

* Blue rope: x - 7
* Red rope: 4 * (x - 7)

Now we know:

* Yellow rope + Blue rope + Red rope = 37
* x + (x - 7) + 4 * (x - 7) = 37

Let's solve for x:

* x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

Now we can find the length of the blue rope:

* Blue rope = x - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

* **Amount given away by Rissa:** Rissa gave away (1/5) * $15 = $3.
* **Ronnie's money after giving some away:** Since they gave the same amount, Ronnie also gave away $3.
* **Ronnie's money left:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's figure this out step by step!

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals they scored in the first half, so they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

In total, team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in the match.

Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in the match.

Adding the goals for both teams, the total number of goals in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Figure out how much chalk is left:** If the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, he has 100% - 45% = 55% left.
* **Calculate the length of the remaining chalk:** 55% of 5 inches is (55/100) * 5 inches = 2.75 inches.
* **Determine how many days the chalk will last:** The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, and he needs to use it until it's less than 2 inches.  

Since he has 2.75 inches left, he can use it for a few more days.

Let's see:

* Day 1: Uses 20% of 2.75 inches, which is (20/100) * 2.75 inches = 0.55 inches.  He has 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches left.
* Day 2: Uses 20% of 2.2 inches, which is (20/100) * 2.2 inches = 0.44 inches. He has 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches left.
* Day 3: Uses 20% of 1.76 inches, which is (20/100) * 1.76 inches = 0.35 inches. He has 1.76 - 0.35 = 1.41 inches left.
* Day 4: Uses 20% of 1.41 inches, which is (20/100) * 1.41 inches = 0.28 inches. He has 1.41 - 0.28 = 1.13 inches left.
* Day 5: Uses 20% of 1.13 inches, which is (20/100) * 1.13 inches = 0.23 inches. He has 1.13 - 0.23 = 0.9 inches left.
* Day 6: Uses 20% of 0.9 inches, which is (20/100) * 0.9 inches = 0.18 inches. He has 0.9 - 0.18 = 0.72 inches left.
* Day 7: Uses 20% of 0.72 inches, which is (20/100) * 0.72 inches = 0.14 inches. He has 0.72 - 0.14 = 0.58 inches left.

* **Step 1: Calculate the new cost per visit:**

   The cost increased by 150%, so the increase is $2 * 1.50 = $3.
   The new cost per visit is $2 + $3 = $5.

* **Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**

   Pauline visited 3 times a year for 5 years, so she made 3 * 5 = 15 visits.
   The total cost for the first 5 years is 15 * $2 = $30.

* **Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**

   She visited 3 times a year for 3 years, making 3 * 3 = 9 visits.
   The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 * $5 = $45.

"Let's figure out how much money Frances makes first.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so she makes 20 * $2 = $40 from cupcakes.

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so she makes 40 * $1 = $40 from cookies.

That means she makes a total of $40 + $40 = $80 from selling cupcakes and cookies.

Now let's see how much she spends.

She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so she spends 5 * $4 = $20 on trays.

Finally, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract her spending from her earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Street 2:** Each of the 5 children brings a friend, so there are 5 + 5 = 10 children.
* **Street 3:** Each of the 10 children brings 2 more friends, so there are 10 + (10 * 2) = 30 children.
* **Leaving:** The original 5 children leave, so there are 30 - 5 = 25 children left.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.
* Let's say there are 'c' chickens and 'w' cows.

We know:

* c + w = 20 (total animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Now we can use some guessing and checking.

Let's try if there are 10 chickens:

* That would be 10 * 2 = 20 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 20 = 50 legs for the cows.
* 50 legs / 4 legs per cow = 12.5 cows.  We can't have half a cow!

Let's try if there are 12 chickens:

* That would be 12 * 2 = 24 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 24 = 46 legs for the cows.
* 46 legs / 4 legs per cow = 11.5 cows. Still not a whole number!

Let's try if there are 14 chickens:

* That would be 14 * 2 = 28 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 28 = 42 legs for the cows.
* 42 legs / 4 legs per cow = 10.5 cows. Nope!

Let's try if there are 16 chickens:

* That would be 16 * 2 = 32 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 32 = 38 legs for the cows.
* 38 legs / 4 legs per cow = 9.5 cows. Not quite!

Let's try if there are 18 chickens:

* That would be 18 * 2 = 36 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 36 = 34 legs for the cows.
* 34 legs / 4 legs per cow = 8.5 cows.  

18 chickens is too many!

Let's try if there are 8 chickens:

* That would be 8 * 2 = 16 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 16 = 54 legs for the cows.
* 54 legs / 4 legs per cow = 13.5 cows. Nope!

Let's try if there are 6 chickens:

* That would be 6 * 2 = 12 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 12 = 58 legs for the cows.
* 58 legs / 4 legs per cow = 14.5 cows. Not a whole number!

Let's try if there are 4 chickens:

* That would be 4 * 2 = 8 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 8 = 62 legs for the cows.
* 62 legs / 4 legs per cow = 15.5 cows. Nope!

Let's try if there are 2 chickens:

* That would be 2 * 2 = 4 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 4 = 66 legs for the cows.
* 66 legs / 4 legs per cow = 16.5 cows. Not a whole number!

Let's try if there are 0 chickens:

* That would be 0 * 2 = 0 legs from chickens.
* That leaves 70 - 0 = 70 legs for the cows.
* 70 legs / 4 legs per cow = 17.5 cows. Nope!
