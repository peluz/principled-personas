Debra saw 30 bees leave initially, and half that number returned, so 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned.

2. **Chile's population six years ago:** The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

3. **Chile's population now:** Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of players on defense.**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many players on offense as defense, so there are 2x players on offense.

* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

* **Combine like terms:** 3.5x = 105

* **Solve for x:** x = 105 / 3.5

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5 per person
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 per person

We want to find the number of guests where the costs are the same. Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1 cost:** $200 + $5x
* **Venue 2 cost:** $25x

Now we set the costs equal to each other and solve for x:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    * Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  D = B / 2  (David found half of what Bodhi found)
    *  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
    *  B + D + L = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

* **Now we can solve for the variables:**

1. **Substitute** the first equation (D = B/2) into the second equation:
   L = (B/2) + 7

2. **Substitute** both the first equation (D = B/2) and the modified second equation (L = (B/2) + 7) into the third equation:
   B + (B/2) + ((B/2) + 7) = 43

3. **Simplify and solve for B:**
   B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43
   2B + 7 = 43
   2B = 36
   B = 18

4. **Now that you know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), you can find D (David's insects):**
   D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Finally, find L (Lily's insects):**
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 't' represent the age of each twin.
    *  Let 'r' represent the age of each triplet.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know one twin is 7 years older than one triplet: t = r + 7
    * We know their combined ages are 44: 2t + 3r = 44

* **Solve for 't' (the age of a twin):**

    1. **Substitute** the first equation (t = r + 7) into the second equation: 2(r + 7) + 3r = 44
    2. **Simplify and solve for 'r':** 2r + 14 + 3r = 44  =>  5r = 30  => r = 6

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
* Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons from this trade.

**2. Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**

* Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

**3. Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**

* Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
* She trades these for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

**4. Total Buttons:**

* Lorraine has 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
    *  Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books.
    *  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 books.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of books is 85, so: F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

* **Solve for F:**
    * Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85
    * Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be ""P""
    * Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
    * Let John's age be ""J""

* **We know:**
    * P + Pa + J = 100 (Their combined age is 100)
    * Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
    * P = Pa + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Now we can substitute:**
    * Since P = Pa + J, we can substitute that into the first equation: (Pa + J) + Pa + J = 100
    * Simplify: 2Pa + 2J = 100
    * Pa + J = 50

* **Substitute again:**
    * We know Pa = J + 10, so substitute that in: (J + 10) + J = 50
    * Simplify: 2J + 10 = 50
    * Subtract 10 from both sides: 2J = 40
    * Divide both sides by 2: J = 20

* **Find Paul's age:**
    * Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

* **Find Peter's age:**
    * P = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50

4. **Remaining distance:** He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

5. **Speed for the second part:** He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, so he swims at 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
    * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
    * B + A + D = 45 (Their total score is 45)

* **Solve for Azibo's points (A):**

    1. Since we know B = A + 20, we can substitute that into the third equation: (A + 20) + A + D = 45
    2. Simplify: 2A + D + 20 = 45
    3.  Subtract 20 from both sides: 2A + D = 25
    4. We also know B = D + 10, so substitute that in: 2A + (B - 10) = 25
    5. Simplify: 2A + B - 10 = 25
    6. Add 10 to both sides: 2A + B = 35
    7. Now we have two equations:
        * 2A + B = 35

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**

    *  A + S + X = 339 (Together they caught 339 Pokemon)

* **Now we can use substitution to solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):**

    1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:** X = (4A - 13) + 5  
    2. **Simplify:** X = 4A - 8
    3. **Substitute both the first and simplified second equation into the third equation:** A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

* Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
* To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

**2. Sauteing:**

* **Greece Trips:** Plane 1 flies to Greece for 3/4 of its trips, so it takes 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips to Greece.
* **France/Germany Trips:** The remaining trips are split between France and Germany, meaning Plane 1 takes 88 - 66 = 22 trips to either France or Germany.
* **France Trips:** These 22 trips are split equally, so Plane 1 takes 22 / 2 = 11 trips to France.

* The third set had 'x / 2' balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
    *  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
    *  r + b + y = 37 (The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters)

* **Solve for the length of the blue rope (b):**
    * Since we know r = 4b and b = y - 7, we can substitute to get: 4b + (y - 7) + y = 37
    * Simplify: 4b + 2y - 7 = 37
    * Combine like terms: 4b + 2y = 44

* **We need another equation to solve for both b and y.  We can use the fact that b = y - 7:**
    * Substitute (y - 7) for b in the equation 4b + 2y = 44: 4(y - 7) + 2y = 44
    * Simplify: 4y - 28 + 2y = 44
    * Combine like terms: 6y - 28 = 44
    * Add 28 to both sides: 6y = 72
    * Divide both sides by 6: y = 12

* **Now that we know y (yellow rope) is 12 centimeters, we can find b (blue rope):**
    * b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

* **Finally, find r (red rope):**
    * r = 4b = 4 * 5 = 20

The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 inches = 2.25 inches.

The teacher started with 5 inches and used 2.25 inches, leaving 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, so the chalk will last 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 inches / 1 inch/day = 2.75 days.
