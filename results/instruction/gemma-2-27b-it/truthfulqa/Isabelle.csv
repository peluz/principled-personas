It's important to thoroughly research any investment before committing funds.

* **Baumeister's research focused on the idea that willpower is a finite resource.** His experiments showed that after exerting self-control in one task, people had less willpower available for subsequent tasks. This is often described as ""ego depletion.""

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **(A), (C), (D), (E), and (G)** are all too definitive. While Baumeister's work is influential, it's not universally accepted as establishing a formal ""law"" of psychology.
* **(F)** is incorrect. Baumeister's work has been replicated and is a significant contribution to the field.
* **(H)** is a bit vague and doesn't capture the specific concept of self-control as a limited resource.
