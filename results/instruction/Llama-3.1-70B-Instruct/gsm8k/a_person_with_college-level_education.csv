"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells:
Total eggs laid: 16
Eggs used: 7
Eggs sold: 16 - 7 = 9

Finally, let's calculate her daily earnings:
Eggs sold: 9
Price per egg: $2
Daily earnings: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we can add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the value added by the repairs to the original value of the house. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, the value added by the repairs is $50,000 * (150/100) = $75,000. The new value is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000 + $50,000 (original cost of repairs) is not correct. We should use the $200,000 value.

The selling price is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, each of 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. 

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. So, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 9 * 20 = 180 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in all three cities by adding the number of sheep in each city:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we first need to calculate the time it takes to download the file normally and then account for the time lost due to the restart.

Normally, Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file size is 200 GB. 

Time to download the file normally = Total file size / Download speed
Time to download the file normally = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time to download the file normally = 100 minutes

However, Carla only downloads 40% of the file before the restart. 

Time taken to download 40% of the file = (40/100) * 100 minutes
Time taken to download 40% of the file = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken to download 40% of the file, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken to download the file normally.

Total time taken = Time taken to download 40% of the file + Time taken for the restart + Time taken to download the file normally
Total time taken = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes
Total time taken = 160 minutes

The answer is: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he initially drove away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance he covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he covered during the 4 hours he tried to get home.

He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

He spent the next half-hour (0.5 hours) driving at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

He spent the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance he covered during the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120
Total Distance = 135 miles

Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
Distance from home = 180 - 135
Distance from home = 45 miles

Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime earnings: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the number of downloads in each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue exceeds the total cost in the 6th year.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Distance covered on the first day = 80 miles
Distance covered on the second day = 150 miles

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will consume 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and Marissa wants to complete it at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we started with 10 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

Since Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). The amount he paid is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price.

We can set up the equation as follows:
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75

Combine like terms:
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:
Allen's current age = 11x

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of gold and silver coins is equal to 110. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 165 / 15 = 11 lego sets.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking and running speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, her running speed is 2 times her skipping speed, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame range.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the safe distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:

Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 articles is (2/5) * 5 = 2 articles. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties as follows:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. So, the cost of a red tie is:
Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
Cost of a red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of a red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of a red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:
Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60
Total cost of red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:
Total cost of ties = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
Total cost of ties = $200 + $600
Total cost of ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then find 3/4 of that number to determine the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

Total number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8
Total units in the building: 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Occupied units = (3/4) * Total units
Occupied units = (3/4) * 120
Occupied units = 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books will weigh 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the team played 22 games in total, so the sum of the games they won and lost is 22. However, we also know that they won 8 more games than they lost, so we can set up the following equations:

W + L = 22
W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for L:

L + 8 + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 14
L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by using the second equation:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, and he is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

Her initial monthly salary is $600. A 10% increase would be 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we will have to calculate the increase for each year.

Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 2: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 3: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Now, we need to calculate her annual salary after three years. Since her monthly salary after three years is $878.46, her annual salary would be 12 * $878.46 = $10,541.52.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Expected attendees = Total invited guests * (1 - 1/4)
Expected attendees = 16 * (1 - 0.25)
Expected attendees = 16 * 0.75
Expected attendees = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Expected attendees * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
Total cost = 9 * 2
Total cost = 18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults will eat 10 lbs each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat to find the total amount needed:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age: 4"
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. We can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the canned tomatoes before they were cooked into sauce. Since the sauce lost half its volume, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. 

The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. So, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Now, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of the canned tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces). 

64 / 16 = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she initially has:
2 plants/window ledge * 40 window ledges = 80 potted plants

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
80 potted plants + 18 potted plants = 98 potted plants

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away:
1 plant/window ledge * 40 window ledges = 40 potted plants

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
98 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 58 potted plants

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. 

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) 
Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 
Total pages = 39 

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages are left to read.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday 
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 
Remaining pages = 24

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon. Since the person bought 10 gallons, the total cashback reward is:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of the gas to find the final cost:

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can calculate the distance per second and then multiply it by the total time it took her to reach the shore.

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second
Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. To find the total amount of water taken on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply it by 2.

Total amount of water = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 16 liters

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary four years ago = Lylah's salary four years ago + 30% of Lylah's salary four years ago
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase (40%) for her salary.

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the current total of stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the current total: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5.

While making the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had left was (x + 5) - 3.

We are given that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

Total patients per day: 500
Average time spent per patient: 24 minutes
Total time spent by doctors per day: 500 * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from patients per day is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital per day is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months and apply it 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase).

Initial price = $20
Price increase every 2 months = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4

After 2 months, the price will be $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, the price will be $24 + 0.20 * $20 = $24 + $4 = $28
However, the correct way to calculate this is to add 20% of the original price to the previous price, not the original price. 
After 4 months, the price will be $24 + 0.20 * $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

To simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the interest rate is 20% and the time period is 2 months.

Price after 36 months = Initial price * (1 + 0.20)^18
However, since the increase is every 2 months, we should use (1 + 0.20)^(36/2) = (1 + 0.20)^18

Price after 36 months = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 ≈ $20 * 7.4859 ≈ $149.718

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Number of eggs needed = Number of flans * Number of eggs per flan
Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9
Number of babysitting sessions = 5

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

There are 2 days in a weekend. Pancho walks 10 miles a day on weekends, so the total miles walked on weekends is:
2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to find the total miles walked in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total payment per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total profit and then work backwards to find the total cost of lemons.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Let's assume they made 'x' gallons of lemonade. Their total revenue would be $10x.

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x.

Their profit is the difference between their total revenue and total cost, which is $10x - $5x = $5x.

We know their profit is $25, so we can set up the equation $5x = $25.

Solving for 'x', we get x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is $3 * 5 = $15.

Now, we can calculate Mark's current age. Since Mark was 19 years old two years ago, Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

From statement 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is 21 years old, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two separate events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the die is rolled twice, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll:

P(even, even) = P(even) × P(even) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities:

ΔP = P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

ΔP (%) = 0.25 × 100 = 25%

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. 

Since there are six tests and she can remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of the five highest scores. The desired average is 93, so the total score of the five highest tests should be 5 * 93 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score of the five tests Brinley has taken so far: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we need to find the score on the sixth test that will give Brinley a total score of 465 when added to 367 and the lowest score of the six tests is removed. 

If we assume the score on the sixth test is x, the total score will be 367 + x. The lowest score will be either 71 or x (if x < 71). 

However, since we want the average of the five highest scores to be 93, we can assume that x will be one of the five highest scores. Therefore, the lowest score will be 71.

Now, we can set up the equation: (367 + x) - 71 = 465 (since the lowest score 71 will be removed).

Simplifying the equation: 296 + x = 465.

Subtracting 296 from both sides: x = 169.

However, this is not possible since the maximum score is 100. This means our assumption that x will be one of the five highest scores is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If the score on the sixth test is x, the total score will be 438 + x. The lowest score will be either 71 or x (if x < 71). 

We want the average of the five highest scores to be 93, so the total score of the five highest tests should be 465. 

If x is one of the five highest scores, the lowest score will be 71, and we already calculated that x = 169, which is not possible.

If x is the lowest score, the total score of the five highest tests will be 438 - 71 + x = 367 + x. We want this to be equal to 465.

Now, we can set up the equation: 367 + x = 465.

Subtracting 367 from both sides: x = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers covered in a week is 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers. Since he did this for four weeks, the total distance covered in the first four weeks is 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers covered in a week is 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers. Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance covered in the next three weeks is 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the distance covered in the first four weeks and the next three weeks to get the total distance: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. The cost of each plate is $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is:

6 plates * $6000 = $36,000

Now, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:

$36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

To find the total cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

$34,800 / 240 cups = $145 per cup

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16).

Expanding the equation: 2x - 16 = 4x - 64.

Rearranging the equation: 2x - 4x = -64 + 16.

Simplifying the equation: -2x = -48.

Dividing both sides by -2: x = 24.

Since x represents the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt, and then divide that by her hourly wage.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The total amount is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount = $2000
Additional amount = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount = Initial amount + Additional amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she owes to find the remaining balance:
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find the total points scored by the three of them: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Initially, the tank had 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the amount of water left is:
120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, so the amount of collected rainwater is:
2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the amount of water left in the tank:
30 + 60 = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to determine the number of petunias he plants and add it to the number of geraniums.

Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we first need to determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2 * Robert's candies = 54

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James' candies can be calculated as:

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin was left with:
19 - 10 = 9

Then, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had:
9 + x

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with:
9 + x - 2

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
9 + x - 2 = 27

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 27 - 9 + 2
x = 20

The number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to determine the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
4 * (number of fish in each aquarium) = 28

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
number of fish in each aquarium = 28 / 4
number of fish in each aquarium = 7

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. The total number of girls is also 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls (not 10, as the problem states he puts the new cows into each of the twenty stalls). So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3.

8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

   So, the total time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes, but this is the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, so we subtract the initial 20 minutes to get the additional time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees which is 28 - 20 = 8 minutes, but we actually need the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees which is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

   So, the time to cook the chicken is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we add the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the additional time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken to get the total time.
Total time = 20 + 8 + 23 = 51 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house, then multiply by the number of houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 * 2 = 6.

In addition to the bedroom windows, there are 4 more windows in each house. So, the total number of windows per house is 6 (bedroom windows) + 4 (additional windows) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number, which is:
900 / 10 = 90 stitches for the collar.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is:
2 * 90 = 180 stitches for the rosette.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches for both sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the song, then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we can add the number of lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. So, we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100

Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Total number of people = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy:
39 / 3 = 13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Maddy will need to buy 13 pizzas.

So, the total amount of money Kelly has initially is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. 
To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has initially:

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row of 5-star has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes break = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 and 32 (back and front)
- Page 2 and 31 (back and front)
- Page 3 and 30 (back and front)
- ...
- Page 16 and 17 (back and front)

This pattern continues until all 32 pages are paired. Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract them from his initial budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = $600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo's initial budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. 
So, the amount he has available to spend is: 
$6000 (initial budget) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Now, let's calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners: 
$4000 (available to spend) - $1950 (total expenses) = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
The rest of the family (2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.
The total daily egg consumption for the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

- 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost:

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and it has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Total number of electric poles required: 15"
"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. 

Let's subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils to find out how many pencils are in the boxes. 
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.
24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know that each box can hold 8 pencils. We also know that Jam and Meg have a total of 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.
72 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 9 boxes.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to determine how many new records each person got on average, and then use the trade ratio to calculate the number of old records.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can find the average number of new records per person by dividing 7 by 5. However, we don't actually need to do this calculation because we know the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.

Since 7 new records were obtained, and the trade ratio is 2:1, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records. 

7 new records * 2 old records per new record = 14 old records

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we need to subtract the non-programmers from the total number of employees to find the number of senior programmers. Assuming all non-programmers are not mentioned, we will consider the remaining employees as senior programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

However, this is the total number of non-junior programmers, which may include non-programmers. Since the problem doesn't provide information about non-programmers, we will assume that the remaining 60 employees are a mix of senior programmers and non-programmers. But for the sake of calculation, we will consider all 60 as senior programmers.

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. So, the salary of senior programmers is:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to charge 40% as follows:

Time = (40 percentage-points) * (3 minutes/percentage-point) = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000/year

For Job B:
- Gross income: $42,000/year
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before income tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly cost of food is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours
- Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number of plant pots she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, so they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for the daisies) + 60 (for the roses) = 90 plant pots.

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3 * Total time = 15 hours
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing. 
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract that from the cost of the phone, taking into account the money she already has.

Annabelle's earnings from her first job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200
Annabelle's earnings from her second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75
Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275
Total savings: $275 (earnings) + $80 (initial savings) = $355

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we can find the combined height of the shortest and second trees: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so we multiply the combined height by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The cost per person includes:
- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- $5 in arcade tokens
- 2 go-kart rides: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Since Morgan also needs to be included, we'll subtract her cost from the total budget first: $90 - $30 = $60

Now, we'll divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 / $30 = 2

Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves each day, we need to calculate the total cost of the lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

The cost of 4 lollipops is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be $2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Number of days = 18,000 / 900 = 20

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 pounds = 8 pounds
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 pounds = 15 pounds

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

3 * 7 = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we can subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = 19

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away a total of:
24 + 5 = 29 cards

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially:
50 - 29 = 21 cards

Finally, we add the number of cards she received from family and friends:
21 + 17 = 38 cards

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark, and the slices eaten by Jenny from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we first need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save. The bike costs $300, and he already has $50 in his bank account. 

The amount Mark still needs to save is $300 - $50 = $250.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find out how many days he needs to save.

$250 / $10 = 25 days

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs separately.

1. Number of spiders: 90
2. Number of millipedes: Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3.
   Number of millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 30
3. Number of stink bugs: The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine their ages. We know Erica is 30 years old. 

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories John consumed is:
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

"To find the total earnings of the builder in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

Since the builder works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of days he works in a month is:
6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we can multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage to find his total earnings:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

"To determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 6 bags (flour) - 2 bottles (milk) = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours, 
7200 watt-hours/day = 7.2 kWh/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the original usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day
2700 watt-hours/day = 2.7 kWh/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the reduced usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Now, we can find the energy saved by subtracting the reduced usage from the original usage:
Energy saved = 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes:
- Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- One zebra has 36 stripes.
- Another zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost per pound.

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to get the total cost.

Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the additional items he bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, the total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 60 (bought) = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he took before the jog and subtract that from the total steps he had left to take after the jog.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before the jog, he had 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. Since he already had 6,000 steps before the jog, the number of steps he took during the jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it takes to read the book and the time it takes to get to the airport from the total time Toby has:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 * 40 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total amount Sally spent is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/recipe = 5 recipes.

Since each recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we can say that Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies.

So, the number of candles that will explode is 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 
So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 5% of the candles that explode, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20

= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount 
= $20 - $6

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * 4

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

Now, let's look at the information about Joanne's sister:

1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

We know that each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump. We are given that there are 304 humps in total. This can be expressed as:
2c + d = 304

We are also given that there are 180 heads in total. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, this can be expressed as:
c + d = 180

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. We can isolate 'c' in the second equation:
c = 180 - d

Substituting this expression for 'c' into the first equation:
2(180 - d) + d = 304

Expanding the equation:
360 - 2d + d = 304

Combine like terms:
-d = -56

Divide by -1:
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by 2.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion to find Zack's locker size.

Let's denote Zack's locker size as Z. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z

To find Z, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up another proportion:

Z = (1/2)T

where T is Timothy's locker size. We can substitute the value of Z we found earlier:

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we need to subtract the introductory period and the increased rate period from the total months to find the number of months at the normal rate. 
However, since the introductory period is 6 months and the increased rate period is 10 months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the normal rate period is indeed 8 months. 
The cost is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, so the cost is:

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original prices of both jeans and the amount saved on each.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved on the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.

The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 * $6 = $4, is from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original prices of both jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but since the jogger jeans cost less, we need to find the difference in the other direction, which is not what the question asks. The question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans, but the jogger jeans cost less. The correct answer to the question is actually the difference in the other direction, but since the question asks for how much more the jogger jeans cost, the answer is actually the negative of the difference.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then:

Number of cards sold = 2/3 * x
100 = 2/3 * x

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he spent in total. 

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * 0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is 0.01 * 5 = $0.05. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Since George spent $1.20 on chips, he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first determine the total weight of the cake eaten by Rory and her mom. Since they each had a piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, they ate 2 pieces.

The weight of each piece is the total weight of the cake divided by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, the total weight of the cake they ate is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

Now, to find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake eaten from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert the length from yards to feet: 

Length = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we calculate James' swim time as follows:
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride, so:
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We can now calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
James' run time = 180 - 121
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time needs to be converted to hours, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
$5 * 6 = $30

Now, we can calculate the change:
Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can fill is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and subtract the cost of purchasing them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from this sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from this sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from both sales:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of purchasing the sneakers:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the popcorn with a soda costs an additional $1, making the total cost $21.

Now, let's consider the non-super ticket option. The movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the non-super ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

We know that the total cost of the non-super ticket option is $19, and the cost of the movie ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15. To find the regular price of popcorn, we subtract the cost of the movie ticket and soda from the total cost: $19 - $15 = $4.

Regular price of popcorn: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green cards and yellow cards.

First, let's find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, let's find the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to isolate x:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's length) * 100

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6), then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both (3) to avoid double-counting.

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class (32) to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

32 - 12 = 20

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300.
So, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

First, let's find the number of oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, we can calculate it as follows:

Total oranges picked = 60
Fraction of oranges eaten = 2/5
Number of oranges eaten = Total oranges picked * Fraction of oranges eaten

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation, we get (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine B terms: 2B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine B terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Wednesday is 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual picking rates of each person.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can add up the individual picking rates to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had left, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked and then add the number of loaves returned.

Total loaves baked = 200
Total loaves sold = 93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132
Loaves returned = 6

Loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold + Loaves returned
Loaves left = 200 - 132 + 6
Loaves left = 74

"To find the total number of rows, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips and then add them together.

For the red tulips, Jackson can fit 6 tulips in a row. He buys 36 red tulips. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

For the blue tulips, Jackson can fit 8 tulips in a row. He buys 24 blue tulips. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for each color: 6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we will divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for cookies = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Total raisins for cookies / Raisins per batch
= 9 cups / (3/4 cup)
= 9 / 0.75

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts/week - 2016 kilowatts/week = 336 kilowatts/week.

Since a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is 336 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take the same person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the total time it would take to paint a whole house would be:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first determine the number of chairs each person has. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of chairs Ophelia has is 20 + 2 = 22.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs. 
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

The total cost of the items Tom bought is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. To do this, we divide the cost of the headphone set ($44) by the cost of a CD ($4). 

$44 / $4 = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and add the hours spent in the weeks with the exceptions.

Josh spent 4 hours per week for 8 weeks, except for 3 weeks. So, he spent 4 hours per week for 5 weeks. 
Total hours spent in the 5 weeks with the usual routine = 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

Now, let's calculate the hours spent in the weeks with exceptions. 
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
- He spent 6 hours in one week.

Total hours spent in the weeks with exceptions = 10 hours + 6 hours = 16 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and the weeks with exceptions to find the total hours spent.
Total hours spent = 20 hours + 16 hours = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider the situation in 8 years. Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's denote the cousin's age in 8 years as x. We can set up the equation:

x = 2(30) - 5
x = 60 - 5
x = 55

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55:

55 - 8 = 47

Now, we know that Jame's current age is 22, and his cousin's current age is 47. To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age:

47 - 22 = 25

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + 2 * Cost of one monitor + Cost of printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2 * Cost of one monitor + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants on the left side:
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800
$1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2:
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys and the girls. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 = 2400). So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how many candies Nick has, we first need to determine how many candies George had initially. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can calculate the initial number of candies George had by adding the candies he ate to the candies he has left.

Initial candies George had = candies eaten + candies left
Initial candies George had = 5 + 3
Initial candies George had = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had by multiplying the initial number of candies George had by 2.

Candies Nick had = 2 * initial candies George had
Candies Nick had = 2 * 8
Candies Nick had = 16

Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first and second halves.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. The daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

The total savings for the month is $1125. We can set up an equation to represent the total savings:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since 'x' represents the daily savings in the first half, the daily savings in the second half is '2x', which is 2 * 25 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the comparison, as the question is asking for a comparison between hot and cold days, but the given information is for cold and warm days. Since we do not have information about hot water, we will assume the warm water time is the closest we have to hot water.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and warm water. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time she spent reading: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate and subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches they ate is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then find the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up the equation: 
51 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years)

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Now, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from the nephew's age in 7 years:
nephew's current age = 17 - 7
nephew's current age = 10

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then add them to Richie's total.

We know Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

We also know Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, we can add the goals scored by all three teenagers: Richie (80) + Mark (60) + Anna (35) = 175.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he can spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent 4 * $10 = $40 on wooden action figures. The number of wooden action figures he bought is $40 / $5 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $40 = $30 left to spend. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $30 / $2 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue is the amount of money earned from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each:
10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = cost of bread + cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of crayon muffins she can create. 

First, we need to find out the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Kate can make 24 crayon muffins. Since she can sell each muffin for $1.50, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

The boy has 5 cards.
The brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards they have together.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450°F
Actual temperature = 468°F
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18°F

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520°F, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520°F, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520
x + 0.04x = 520
1.04x = 520

Now, divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500°F.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we can calculate the combined value of the two houses:
Combined value: Herb's house value + Juan's house value

"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84

First, let's calculate the cost of one box after the 10% discount:
Original price = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:
Total cost = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, let's calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
Total contacts = 2 * 90 = 180 contacts

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 lenses (left and right), the total number of pairs is:
Total pairs = 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs

Now, let's calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her workout.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned during her workout is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total ml of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and multiplying by 100.

Total ml of water = (1600 / 200) * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the first 4 hours are:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour

Total earnings for the first 4 hours:
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the next 2 hours are:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour

Total earnings for the next 2 hours:
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings for 6 hours:

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations.

First, let's calculate the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

To find the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the cost of each pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings per 2 pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps / 120 washings * (1 pump / 1 washing) * (1 bottle / 120 washings) 
Total number of pumps = 2 * 120 = 240 pumps per bottle.

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
Discounted price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left:
$50 - $42 = $8

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 

The cost per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

The cost per month for the additional months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The total cost for the additional months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people in the class, including himself and the teacher, and then multiply that by 2 (since he's getting one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person).

The total number of people in the class is 25 classmates + 1 teacher + 1 Howie = 27 people.

Since Howie is getting 2 cupcakes for each person, the total number of cupcakes he should buy is 27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.

"To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the number of likes after three weeks and then add the new likes.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after three weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, we add the initial likes to this number: 140000 + 2000 = 142000.

Finally, we add the new likes: 142000 + 20000 = 162000.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to calculate her sales from green hats. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can calculate the sales from green hats as follows:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate the sales in the second month as follows:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the sales from both months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900
Total amount in two months = $2100

"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he used the carriage and then apply the given pricing structure.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the previous hour. So, the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: 
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105

First, let's calculate the amount she actually received. We know her bank account had $200 initially and now has $420, so the amount she received is the difference between these two amounts:

$420 (final amount) - $200 (initial amount) = $220

This means Sally received $220 this week. However, her expected wage is $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her expected wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (actual amount received) = $80

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

"To determine the number of eggs Lori will need, we first need to find out the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to prepare. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of eggs Lori will need is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since eggs are usually sold in dozens, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens Lori will need is 24 / 12 = 2.

"To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the number of days it will take him to finish the book and then subtract that from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment.

The total number of pages in the book is 200 pages. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. 

Number of days to finish the book = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 200 pages / 10 pages/day
= 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Number of days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish the book

"To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly hanger rental cost is $5000. For a year, this would be $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental cost, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. For a year, this would be $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs:

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40. 

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation (4s + 2g = 70) to get 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1
Cost of the more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants to buy a week's worth of coffee, he needs to buy 7 pounds of coffee.

Cost of 7 pounds of coffee = 7 * $6 = $42

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is:

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them up.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 adults and 15 babies. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Mia already has 8 high chairs, so she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

She also needs 42 regular chairs, but she only has 40. So, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we first need to determine the total points collected by the students. 

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of city fireworks she can see and add the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of city fireworks: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300: 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they still need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can calculate the amount they raise per hour by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly amount: $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of additional hours they need to fundraise. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the initial 3 hours: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, and then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%:
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then multiply it by the total number of hours.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the problem doesn't specify the proportion of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, we'll assume the factory can switch between the two flavors. To maximize production, the factory would make chocolate ice cream, as it has a higher production rate.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

However, if the factory makes both flavors, we need to consider the production rate of both. Let's assume the factory makes chocolate ice cream for 24 hours and vanilla ice cream for 24 hours.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 24 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 24 hours = 1200 quarts.
Total quarts of vanilla ice cream in 24 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour * 24 hours = 300 quarts.

Total quarts in 48 hours = 1200 quarts + 300 quarts = 1500 quarts.

Considering both scenarios, the maximum possible production is 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. However, if the factory makes both flavors, the total production would be 1500 quarts.

Assuming the factory makes both flavors, the answer is:

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can afford with $6.00.

Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, we divide Erin's budget by the cost of each set: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets, which is 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

However, since Erin can only buy 2 sets, and the question asks how many scoops she should buy, not how many sets, we need to consider if she can afford to buy 1 more scoop. 

Erin has $6.00 and has spent $6.00 on 2 sets of 3 scoops. She has no money left to buy an additional scoop.

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

Total pounds picked: 30
Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)

Total cost of buying at the store = Cost per pound at the store * Total pounds
Total cost of buying at the store = $2.5 * 30
Total cost of buying at the store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add the weights of all her books. 

She has math and science books, each weighing 2 pounds, so the total weight of these two books is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books: 
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total voters - Total votes received by candidates A and B
= 100 - 50
= 50

"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris initially, we need to subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube, and he makes 3 of them, so the total amount of water used for giant cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube, and he makes 7 of them, so the total amount of water used for medium cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube, and he makes 8 of them, so the total amount of water used for small cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation:

Cost of gallon jar = Cost of half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Cost of half-gallon jar + $2

Subtracting $2 from both sides gives us the cost of a half-gallon jar:
Cost of half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:
Total cost = (Cost of gallon jar * Number of gallon jars) + (Cost of half-gallon jar * Number of half-gallon jars)
Total cost = ($5 * 10) + ($3 * 16)
Total cost = $50 + $48

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 students / 2 classes = 40 students per class

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

40 students per class * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Finally, to find the number of boys in each class, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 students per class - 16 girls per class = 24 boys per class

"To find the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards is the sum of the values of the individual cards. 
- The card worth $4000
- The card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so 30 * $50 = $1500

The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit Mark made is the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs.

Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students that can be accommodated in 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

However, we are not concerned with the total number of students, but rather the number of groups. Since the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups (12) and the initial number of groups (6).

12 groups (required) - 6 groups (initial) = 6 groups

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, 9 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. 

Combining the large buttons, she has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons.

In total, she has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons, and 3 small stickers. Since the question asks for the number of buttons, we ignore the stickers.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33 to find the number of votes against the regulation.

Solving for x, we get x = 33 / 3 = 11.

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each category of movies separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in each category:
- Total movies: 600
- Movies in series: 600 / 3 = 200 movies
- Remaining movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies
- Older movies: 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies
- Normal movies (not in series and not older): 400 - 160 = 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the cost of each category:
- Movies in series: 200 movies * $6 = $1200
- Older movies: 160 movies * $5 = $800
- Normal movies: 240 movies * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the costs of each category:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Now, let's consider the points from the remaining time on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, if Emma has 't' seconds left, Ava has 't - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30t
Points from time for Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for Emma and Ava:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)

The difference between their scores is the total points for Ava minus the total points for Emma:
Difference = (10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120) - (10x + 5y + 30t)
= 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t
= 80 + 15 - 120
= -25

The difference between their two scores is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the days they ride twice as much.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the days they ride twice as much, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times a day for 2 days. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the days they ride twice as much:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Since there are two people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of rides by 2:
27 rides * 2 = 54 rides

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that x + y = 17 (since he bought 17 fish in total).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had 3 + y orange fish and 4 + x white fish. According to the problem, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3 + y = 8 + 2x
y = 5 + 2x

We also know that x + y = 17. Substituting y = 5 + 2x into this equation, we get:
x + (5 + 2x) = 17
Combine like terms:
3x + 5 = 17
Subtract 5 from both sides:
3x = 12
Divide by 3:
x = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

In a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since Carrie spent all the quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we multiply the number of twenties by 3/5, then multiply the result by the value of each twenty:
10 twenties * (3/5) = 6 twenties
6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the nighttime temperature and 32 degrees to determine how much the house needs to be heated.

Temperature difference: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money paid to the employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money paid after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

Since the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can first divide both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
Total hours played in the next week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'z' (since it's the same as zest), the amount of salt as '2z' (twice the amount of zest), the amount of sugar as '2z' (same as salt), and the amount of oil as '4z' (twice the amount of salt).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10

Combine like terms:

10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

z = 1

Now that we know z is 1, we can find the amount of oil (4z):

Oil = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:
8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes he already has) = 15 cupcakes

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sells. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 (from students) / 20 (number of students) = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars were added, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

Then, during lunch, 1/2 of the cars left. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot during lunch is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick = 3x = 3 * 47 = 141

And the number of cards Becca has:

Becca = 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the original cost of the book.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost based on weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original cost of the book is $32.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the original cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, we divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for one kangaroo:

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the turtles will take twice as long as a kangaroo to travel the same distance. So, we multiply the time for one kangaroo by 2 to find the time for one turtle:

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all four turtles to travel across the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle:

Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can rewrite S as S = A - 2 and B as B = A + 3. 

Substituting B and S in the last equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
6A + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
6A = 78

Divide both sides by 6:
A = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water after the increase on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 
After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so the total amount of water passing through the river is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previously infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previously infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip per customer = $20
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20 = $800

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find the amount Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80
Total tips for Julieta = $800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we need to add their individual totals.

Total tips = $800 + $720 = $1520

The total number of oranges she gave away is 6 (to her daughters) + 3 (to her boy) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. After giving away 9 oranges, she remained with 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year: 36 (Wendy) - 6 (Amber) = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, then multiply that by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised is 80 slices * 50 cents/slice = 4000 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 4000 cents / 100 = 40 dollars.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to determine the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins.

We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. However, we are also given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To find the number of silver coins, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver and gold coins:

Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold)
Total coins = 110

Total number of burritos eaten by students = 50 * 10 = 500
Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George = 20
Total number of burritos eaten = 500 + 20 = 520

Now, let's calculate the total number of leftover burritos:
Total number of leftover burritos = Total number of burritos ordered - Total number of burritos eaten
Total number of leftover burritos = 600 - 520
Total number of leftover burritos = 80

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F. 

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne) 
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can express S in terms of F by substituting A in the first equation with F - 12 from the second equation:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so A + S + F = 85. 
Substituting S with F + 13 and A with F - 12:
(F - 12) + (F + 13) + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84
Divide by 3:
F = 28

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. In the first week, she made $6 (from Joe) + $18 (from Kamala) = $24. In the following week, she made $30 (from Alba). So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $24 + $30 = $54.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we need to first subtract the cookies her husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel's pages from yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their two children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in terms of child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day to find out how much free time Harold has left:
24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (total hours spent on activities) = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. It's given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so the number of packages he completes per hour is:
50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Since Colby works for 8 hours a day, the total number of packages he completes in a day is:

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we need to calculate the total time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide that by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle of water.

First, we find the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku: 
Time for a normal sudoku = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku = 4 * Time for a normal sudoku = 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we convert the time interval at which John drinks a bottle of water to minutes:
Time interval = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes

Now, we divide the total time for the extreme sudoku by the time interval:
Number of bottles = Time for extreme sudoku / Time interval = 180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:

20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 total pieces - 40 pieces at red balloons = 18 pieces at yellow balloons

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces at yellow balloons / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. The difference between these two ages is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months.

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea in each row is:

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

As the number of chamomile and mint tea cups is equal in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row:

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has for the month.

Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He has also seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. The total amount spent on movies so far is $50 + $56 = $106.

He has also had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He has had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. The total amount spent on snacks so far is $16 + $8 = $24.

The total amount spent so far is $106 + $24 = $130. Since Colby has $150 for the month, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on snacks. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10 for a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left.

2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute P and L from the above equations into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to calculate the total number of bottles she has after redeeming the coupons and then subtract the number of bottles she gave to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gave away from the total number of bottles she had:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the labor time to the nearest hour. 2.25 hours will be rounded up to 3 hours. Labor charge = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for, and the amount he sold the unwanted CDs for.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got the CDs for 40% off, he paid 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 for the 5 CDs.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from the amount he paid:
$90 (amount paid) - $40 (amount received) = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches, which is 1.5 inches. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, so his stapling rate is:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we can multiply the total minutes by his stapling rate to find the total number of reports stapled:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she spent sleeping and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so the actual time she slept is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also spent 23 minutes (from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.) sleepwalking. Subtracting this from the total time, we get 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons he initially had. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, the total number of occupied beds = 200 (initial) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds
The total number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"To find Shawna's father's age, we first need to find Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

Number of holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by the three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

1. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first leg: 
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled in the northerly direction for the second leg:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the third leg:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total southerly distance to find the actual distance between the two homes:
Distance between homes = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have a combined total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the combined total of Robert and Richard from the total number of cherries:

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that at that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48. Since this is 5 years from now, we can calculate his dad's current age as D = 48 - 5 = 43.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that at that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12. Since this is 5 years from now, we can calculate his brother's current age as B = 12 - 5 = 7.

Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants (30 inches) to find the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of 18. 

18 / 2 = 9

Since Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day, to find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply this number by 7 (the number of days in a week).

9 * 7 = 63

"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / 1 pound/rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them:

15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backwards.

Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, and the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it.

At that time, Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it, he saw it for the first time 75 years before that. Therefore, to find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we subtract 75 from 90 and then subtract another 75.

However, we can simply subtract 75 from 90 to find the age difference between the two sightings and then subtract that age difference from 90 to find Bill's age at the first sighting. 

90 - 75 = 15. 
90 - 15 = 75.

However, that is not correct. We need to subtract 75 from 90 to get the age difference between the two sightings and then subtract that age difference from 90 to get the age at the first sighting.

2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane takes to France in a day, we need to first determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is:

88 - 66 = 22 flights

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is:

22 / 2 = 11 flights

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12. 

The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. 

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children: 
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

We are given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know the ages of Akbar (3 years old) and Alessandro (4 years old). We also know Helene's age (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of the known ages from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The total amount collected from the neighbors is $500. 
The total amount collected from the online fund is $1500. 
The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend gives him $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 
Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church. 

There were 100 guests at the reception, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is 4x. There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total size of all slices is the sum of the kids' and adults' slices: 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x / 8x) * 100% = 25%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract that from the serving time.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

The cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $40 per session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

Total population = 50
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50
Number of female porcupines = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is:
4 babies/month * 12 months/year = 48 babies/year

Total number of babies born in a year = 48 babies/year * 30 female porcupines
Total number of babies born in a year = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the total number of babies born in a year:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons
Total water pumped: 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, and 12000 gallons have been pumped. To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before this 3-hour period:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.79
Charge before 3 hours = 35.44%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up an equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.44% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.44% / 0.59
Initial charge = 60%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 60%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10,000. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income, which is the sum of her wages and tips.
$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her weekly income is:
$25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1,000 per week.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
Total amount needed / Weekly income = Number of weeks
$2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals as $4(2L) = $8L.

The total earnings from the sales of both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12L + $8L = $120

Combine like terms:

$20L = $120

Divide both sides by $20:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

First, let's calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in is 50% (or 0.5). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability that the normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension, and Marcus gets a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 0.76

Since the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 0.76, the probability that he will have to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.76 = 0.24.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:
0.24 * 100 = 24%

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of seats available for friends and family. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the seats allocated for graduates, which is 950.

Number of graduates: 950

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first determine how many medium-sized beans he can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3. 

150 * 3 = 450

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total earnings and total expenses, then subtract the expenses from the earnings and divide by the total hours worked.

Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so she spends 3 * 3 = $9 on parking.

Now, we subtract her expenses from her earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, we divide her earnings after expenses by the total hours worked to find her hourly wage: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to determine the number of bottles he can fit in his driveway. 

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes him to move to each bottle:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

Total apples = 2 * 40
Total apples = 80

Now, we know Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both separately.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

So, the total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of each fabric piece is the product of the new length and width:
Area = length * width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
Total area = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day to find the total:

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8:
21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 0.375 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days worked to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:
189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms and multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Depreciation for the first year (2007-2008) = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Depreciation for the second year (2008-2009) = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Depreciation for the third year (2009-2010) = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten per day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 individual roses for $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves at 125 minutes as well.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total time it took James to reach the store by dividing the total distance by his walking speed (4 miles per hour). 

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then subtract the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches with an average of 4 bananas per bunch, so the total number of bananas is:
10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:
40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches:
$32.00 (individual cost) - $30.00 (bunch cost) = $2.00

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Growth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. 
Number of Trekking bikes = 300 * 0.5 = 150 bikes
Price of one Trekking bike = $450
Total earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 
Number of BMX bikes = 300 * 0.15 = 45 bikes
Price of one BMX bike = $500 / 2 = $250 (since BMX is half the price of an MTB)
Total earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. 
Number of MTB bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes
Price of one MTB bike = $500
Total earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month.
Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

1. Time spent in class per day: 
   There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day.
   Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.
   Converting this to hours, we get 320 / 60 = 5.33 hours per day.

2. Time spent in class per week:
   Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 5.33 * 5 = 26.65 hours.

3. Extra learning time on weekends:
   John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday.
   First, we need to find the total minutes John spends in class per week: 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.
   Then, we calculate the extra learning time per weekend day: (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes.
   Converting this to hours, we get 100 / 60 = 1.67 hours per weekend day.
   Since John spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per week is 1.67 * 2 = 3.33 hours.

4. Total time spent learning per week:
   Adding the time spent in class and the extra learning time, we get 26.65 + 3.33 = 29.98 hours.

The initial height from which Nathan drops the ball is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the initial weight. Therefore, the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100.

Probability (percentage) = 0.25 * 100

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days = 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discounts.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, the number of years she needs to work is less than 40. However, without knowing the exact number of years she has already worked, we can't provide an exact answer.

However, if we assume she just started working, then the number of years she needs to work is 40."

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount given away is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the question asks about James, but the initial buyers were Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, we can assume James is one of them. However, without knowing which one, we can only calculate the total amount left. 

The total amount left is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to calculate the net change in temperature from the initial temperature.

Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop overnight: -8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase in the morning: 3 degrees Celsius

Net change in temperature: -8 + 3 = -5 degrees Celsius

Now, we add the net change to the initial temperature:
2 + (-5) = -3 degrees Celsius

Final temperature in the morning: -3 degrees Celsius"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he had initially and the total amount he spent.

Raymond initially had $21. He then saved $11 from his allowance, so the total amount of money he had is $21 + $11 = $32.

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know that Anna had a budget of $16 and she has already spent $4 before buying the books. So, the remaining budget for the books is $16 - $4 = $12.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students enrolled last year and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 students is 0.20 * 50 = 10 students.

Now, we add the 10 students to the original 50 students to get the total number of students enrolled this year.

50 + 10 = 60

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fish.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 male fish. Tate bought 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, so the new total number of male fish is 7 + 2 + 2 = 11.

Initially, there were 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 7 + 5 = 12 female fish. Tate bought 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so the new total number of female fish is 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fish: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5.

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and then add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

Total time: 18"
"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we calculate the distance of the one-way trip. We know the time taken (2 hours) and the speed (70 mph), so we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
Total miles per month = 2 * 280 miles
Total miles per month = 560 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, we divide the total miles walked by Sofie by 2 to find the miles walked by Brian.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 
The two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker needs to produce 400 - 200 - 20 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's two dogs and add it to the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
60 (Kory's dog) + 15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) = 105 pounds

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards. 

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we first need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M's in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's in each small bag, which is 10. 

So, the number of small bags John can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to calculate half the circumference of the earth and then divide it by the distance Alfie flies in a day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 miles per hour. 
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour 
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 600 miles per hour 

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour 
Speed of fastest car = 750 miles per hour

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first determine his age two years ago. 

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To find out how many eggs Camden painted compared to Arnold, we need to first determine the number of eggs each person painted.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs.

Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs (since Camden and Sarah painted 30). 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number Arnold painted:
Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

Then, we calculate the number of 4-foot logs he can make:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we find out the total number of planks he can make:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money he makes:

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the individual salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, covering a distance of 2 miles. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

2 miles = x * 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
Time = distance / speed
Time = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20 miles per minute)
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28, we can divide the amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per week:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the final temperature of the water in the bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into his bottle, the total volume becomes 5 ounces. 

The final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, as Donny can drink it. We can use the concept of heat transfer to set up an equation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = (5 ounces * 40 degrees)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Since the temperature of the second bottle must be at least this value, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

With a 10% discount, the total cost will be $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 * 3 = 39

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:
20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the individual days required for each type of scene, but this would assume she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's complete. A more efficient approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days required for each type of scene or to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days. We can do this by working on the scenes with the highest number of days required first.

9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) is not the correct approach, as she can work on multiple scenes in those 9 days. 

A better approach is to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days. We can do this by working on the scenes with the highest number of days required first.

Lauren can work on large scenes for 9 days (completing 45 large scenes and 9 * 6 = 54 medium scenes is not possible in 9 days, but she can work on 9 * 6 = 54 is more than 36 medium scenes she needs, so she can complete the 36 medium scenes in less than 9 days if she works on medium scenes after completing large scenes), and then work on the remaining medium scenes (which is 0, since she can complete the 36 medium scenes in less than 9 days) and then work on the small scenes.

However, a more efficient way is to work on large scenes for 7 days (completing 35 large scenes and 7 * 6 = 42 medium scenes is more than 36 medium scenes she needs, so she can complete the 36 medium scenes in 7 days if she works on medium scenes after completing 35 large scenes in 7 days), and then work on the remaining large scenes (10 large scenes) and small scenes.

10 large scenes / 5 scenes per day = 2 days
49 small scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

10 large scenes / 5 scenes per day = 2 days
49 small scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, she can work on the small scenes in less than 7 days if she works on the small scenes after completing the large scenes in 7 days and the remaining large scenes in 2 days.

7 days (to complete 35 large scenes and 36 medium scenes) + 2 days (to complete the remaining 10 large scenes) + 7 days (to complete the 49 small scenes) is not the correct answer, since she can work on the small scenes in less than 7 days if she works on the small scenes after completing the large scenes in 7 days and the remaining large scenes in 2 days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we can find the probability that both tickets are winners by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning:

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we can calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total cost price of 6 devices is 6 * $20 = $120.

The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total revenue from selling 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The total profit earned by Linus is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to meet the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs.

Now, to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To meet the required amount, they need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
- 3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
- 1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows:
- All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 babies
- 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100.

2. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land. Abraham initially had 80 square meters. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

   He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. The amount earned from this sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we need to calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the third apartment complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120.

- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the production for each year:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Length of blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). 

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the non-yellow portion of the mural into three equal parts. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half (also 50%) is divided among the three colors. This means that 50% of the total paint is divided into three equal parts, and each part represents the amount of paint used for red, white, and purple.

Now, let's calculate the amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is 50% of 12 pints, which is 6 pints. This 6 pints is divided among the three colors (red, white, and purple).

6 pints / 3 colors = 2 pints per color

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box and the cost per pod.

The regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods, so we calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

100 pods * 1.20 (20% increase) = 120 pods

Since the new box costs the same as the regular box ($12), we can calculate the cost per pod as follows:

$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Now, we need to find out how many pods we can buy for $1:

$1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 pods

Since each pod corresponds to one dishwashing cycle, we can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide $1200 by $5.

$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Initially, the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. This means 55% of the chalk is left.

Since the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can calculate the length of the chalk left after Monday:

5 inches * 0.55 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day. However, we should express this in terms of the percentage of the original 5-inch piece of chalk.

The teacher uses 20% of the original 5-inch piece of chalk per day, which is:

5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch per day

However, we should express this in terms of the percentage of the original 5-inch piece of chalk that is used per day. Since the teacher uses 1 inch per day, and the original piece of chalk is 5 inches, we can calculate the percentage of the original piece of chalk used per day as:

(1 inch / 5 inches) * 100% = 20%

Now, we can calculate how many days it will take to use up the remaining 55% of the original piece of chalk at a rate of 20% per day:

Number of days = Total percentage of chalk left / Percentage of chalk used per day
= 55% / 20%
= 2.75

However, since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to calculate how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday. If the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk per day (20% of the original 5-inch piece of chalk), we can calculate the number of days it will take to use up the remaining chalk until it is 2 inches or less:

Number of days = (2.75 inches - 2 inches) / 1 inch per day + 1 day (since the teacher will use the chalk on the day it becomes 2 inches or less)
= 0.75 inches / 1 inch per day + 1 day
= 0.75 + 1
= 1.75 + 1 (round up to the nearest whole number since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day)

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

C = 20

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

$500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book:

$27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find the number of books per school:

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

2. After throwing the apple at the tree, 5 more apples fell. He picked them up, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This means he now had 1 (initial apple) + 4 (new apples) = 5 apples in his pocket.

3. After throwing the apple at the tree, 6 more apples fell. He picked them up and went home. This means he now had 5 (apples already in his pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 11 apples.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of snowballs he builds per minute:

20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so we can calculate the number of snowballs that melt per minute:

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

Since Jay builds 1/3 snowballs per minute and 2/15 snowballs melt per minute, the net rate at which he gains snowballs is:

(1/3 - 2/15) snowballs per minute

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15:

(5/15 - 2/15) snowballs per minute = 3/15 snowballs per minute

Now, we can simplify this fraction:

3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute

Since Jay gains 1/5 snowballs per minute, we can calculate the time it will take him to gain 60 snowballs:

Time = Total snowballs / Rate
Time = 60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
Time = 60 * 5 minutes
Time = 300 minutes

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference and then calculate Jim's age.

Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we know that 20 years have passed since it first came out. 

When Digimon first came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's denote Jim's age at that time as 'x'. Then, John's age at that time would be '2x'.

We know that John is 28 now. Since 20 years have passed, we can set up an equation to find John's age at that time:

John's current age = John's age 20 years ago + 20
28 = 2x + 20

Now, we can solve for 'x':

2x = 28 - 20
2x = 8
x = 4

So, Jim's age 20 years ago was 4. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
= 4 + 20

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. 

Before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 (used on the second day) + 38 (used on the first day) - 50 (ordered on the first day) = 119 bandages.

However, this includes the 50 bandages ordered on the first day. So, to find the initial number of bandages, we subtract the 50 ordered on the first day: 119 - 50 = 69.

Then, we also need to subtract the 100 bandages ordered on the third day: 69 - 100 is incorrect since we are trying to find the initial number of bandages. We should instead add the 100 bandages ordered on the third day to the 50 bandages ordered on the first day and subtract the total bandages used over the three days from the total bandages ordered plus the initial number of bandages. 

Let x be the initial number of bandages. Then x + 50 + 100 = 78 + 25 + 28 + 38. 

x + 150 = 169

x = 169 - 150

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is:
$270 + $40 = $310

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

Blood in a shark = 3 * Blood in a whale
Blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * Blood in a shark
Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on each day:
Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can write the equation as:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours he traveled in 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and the number of grapes used by their mother.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00. 
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00. 
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms and then divide that by the total time available for cleaning.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. So, the total time spent cleaning all classrooms is:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, we can calculate the total time spent cleaning per day:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

Now, we need to convert the 8-hour workday to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the time spent cleaning per day by the total time available and multiply by 100:
(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, a single bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books she has (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs, the total revenue from selling the eggs, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs * $2.40 per dozen = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of:
5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the price per egg is $1/3. 
The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:
60 eggs * $1/3 per egg = 60 * $1/3 = $20

Now, let's calculate Rose's profit:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $20 - $12
= $8

Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original cost per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Total cost per bag after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100.

Total cost in cents: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

Cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110, which is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

On the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 
So, 77 - 42 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is equal to 116:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of blueberry cubes: 96"

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There is a flashlight for every person (4 people) and two for each room (8 rooms). 
Number of flashlights for people = 4
Number of flashlights for rooms = 8 * 2 = 16
Total number of flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, so half the rooms would be 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
For half the rooms (4 rooms), there are 4 small candles each. 
Number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
For the other half of the rooms (4 rooms), there are 5 medium candles each.
Number of medium candles = 5 * 4 = 20
Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Since the sixth side is already solved once the fifth side is done, we don't need to add any extra time.

Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs John needs to buy is 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Given that each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Her total earnings are the sum of her earnings from cupcakes and cookies:

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8, and the second T-shirt costs 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered and then find the difference between the number of beakers he gathered and the number he was supposed to gather.

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + x beakers = 29 items.

We know that Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which is 7 beakers. However, he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers he lost as y.

So, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is 7 - y.

Now, we can set up the equation: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + (7 - y) beakers = 29 items.

Combine the constants: 8 + 16 + 7 = 31.

Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile as follows:

Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = Total time Aaron took / Distance Aaron ran
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 8 minutes

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile is twice the time it takes Aaron to run one mile:

Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * 8 minutes
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 30 / 2
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

The number of chickens is 5.
