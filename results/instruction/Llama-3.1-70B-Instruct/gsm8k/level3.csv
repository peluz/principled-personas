"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to first determine the number of eggs she sells. 

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid by the ducks: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, we multiply the amount of blue fiber by 1/2.

Amount of blue fiber: 2 bolts
Amount of white fiber: 2 * 1/2 = 2 * 0.5 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts.

Total bolts = Amount of blue fiber + Amount of white fiber
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

"To calculate the profit, we first need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 
New value = Original value + (150% of Original value) 
New value = $80,000 + $120,000 
New value = $200,000

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost price for Josh is the original value plus the repair cost.
Total cost price = Original value + Repair cost 
Total cost price = $80,000 + $50,000 
Total cost price = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit made by Josh.
Profit = New value - Total cost price 
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

First, we multiply the number of sprints he runs per session (3) by the number of sessions per week (3). 
3 sprints/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 sprints/week

Now, we multiply the total number of sprints per week (9) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters).
9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed her chickens need in a day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day and there are 3 meals, the total amount of feed needed per chicken per day is indeed 3 cups. 

Since there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the discount on every second glass. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since the discount applies to every second glass, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

- 8 glasses at full price ($5 each): 8 * $5 = $40
- 8 glasses at 60% of the price ($3 each): 8 * $3 = $24

Total cost = $40 + $24 = $64

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To calculate the total download time, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla already downloaded 80 GB before the restart, so she doesn't need to download that part again. But since she has to restart from the beginning, we can't subtract the already downloaded part. We can only add the time it took to download the 80 GB before the restart and the time for the restart itself to the total download time of the file.

The total time is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he was initially away from home.

Initially, John drove 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was away from home is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours:
- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.
- He spent the next half-hour (0.5 hours) driving at 30 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled during the 4 hours is:
15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he traveled from the distance he was initially away from home:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime hours.

Regular hours: 40 hours
Regular hourly rate: $10
Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime rate: 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
Overtime pay: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month separately.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. 
So, the number of downloads in the second month = 3 * 60 = 180.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. 
To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
30% of 180 = (30/100) * 180 = 0.3 * 180 = 54.
So, the number of downloads in the third month = 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads over the three months by adding the downloads for each month.
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 
6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together:

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. 

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons: 
7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Now, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree: 
$3/year

The net annual revenue is the difference between the annual revenue and the annual cost: 
$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year

Since the initial cost of planting the tree is $90, we need to divide this by the net annual revenue to find the break-even point: 
$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years

However, this is the point where Carlos will break even, not start earning money. To start earning money, he needs to wait for one more year. 

So, the number of years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree is 12 + 1 = 13 years.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

She then sold 2 more to the red house. Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. So, she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance: 
20% * 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students after contemporary dance enrollment: 
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 
25% * 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Remaining students after jazz dance enrollment (enrolled in hip-hop dance): 
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day (westward) and the distance covered on the second day (northward), then add them together.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 
On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northward.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can simply add the distances to find the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days. 

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we started with 10 liters, but spilled 1 liter. So, the amount of orange drink left is 10 - 1 = 9 liters. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

Years ago son was born = Raymond's current age - age when son was born
Years ago son was born = 37 - 23
Years ago son was born = 14

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can express this as 0.75x = 19.50.

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75.

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of the second and third friends.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. 
Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 
20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 
20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses of all three friends: 80, 60, and 100.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling the lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling the lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - (165 / 15) = 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets less than he had.

2 lego sets were not sold, so he still has 2 lego sets.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2.

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends:

Time running = 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours
Time walking = 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours

Distance running = Running speed * Time running
Distance running = 6 * 2
Distance running = 12 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time walking
Distance walking = 1.5 * 4

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Distance without gemstone = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find the distance outside of the dragon's flames where Polly can still hit the dragon. To do this, we subtract the dragon's flame distance from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone.

Distance outside of flames = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's flame distance

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones initially set out. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:
5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:
40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total Revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. For every 10 candles, Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.

Total Cost = Number of pounds of beeswax * Cost per pound
Since 10 candles require 1 pound of beeswax, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax.
Total Cost = 2 * $10.00
Total Cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit.

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net Profit = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the number of hours it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased as 'x'. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing 'x' more, she had 80 + x Post-it notes. She then used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is (80 + x) - 220. We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Combine like terms:
-140 + x = 23

Add 140 to both sides:
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4. 

Number of occupied units = 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units

Eggs produced per week = 252 * 7 
Eggs produced per week = 1764 

Now, let's convert the total number of eggs produced per week to dozens. 
1 dozen = 12 eggs 
Eggs produced per week in dozens = 1764 / 12 
Eggs produced per week in dozens = 147

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight.

Weight of comic books removed = 30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to get 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the weight he needs to remove by the weight of each toy.

Number of toys to remove = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15

"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) or tied (if any) should be equal to 22.

However, since the problem doesn't mention any drawn or tied games, we can assume that the team either won or lost each game. Therefore, the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22.

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as:

W = L + 8

We can now set up a system of linear equations:

W + L = 22
W = L + 8

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting L into the equation W = L + 8:

W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase. 
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
Her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.

However, this 10% increase is applied every year for the next three years. 
After the first year, her monthly salary will be $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $726.
After the second year, her monthly salary will be $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $798.6.
After the third year, her monthly salary will be $798.6 + 0.1 * $798.6 = $878.46.

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary.
Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the expected number of attendees by 0.75.

Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the total gift bags by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. 
20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.

Children eat half as much as adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad each. 
There are 5 children, so 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad for the children.

Now, we add the amount of potato salad for the adults and children together: 
200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information given to set up a system of linear equations. 

Let's denote Amy's age as A, Jackson's age as J, Corey's age as C, and James' age as M (which we already know is 10).

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. M = C - 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
4. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)

We can substitute the value of M from equation 4 into equation 3 to find C:
10 = C - 1
C = 11

Now that we know Corey's age, we can use equation 2 to find Amy's age:
A = C - 2
A = 11 - 2
A = 9

Now that we know Amy's age, we can use equation 1 to find Jackson's age:
A = J + 5
9 = J + 5
J = 4

Jackson's age is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Gerald's original time for running the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time can be found by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, we need to find Gerald's improved time after a 10% improvement in his speed. A 10% improvement means that his new time will be 90% of his original time (100% - 10% = 90%). 

Gerald's improved time = 90% of Gerald's original time
Gerald's improved time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's improved time = 36 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We are given the following information:
1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats: R = D + C - 12
2. There are two cats for every dog: C = 2D
3. The number of dogs is 60: D = 60

We can start by substituting the value of D into the second equation to find the number of cats:
C = 2D
C = 2(60)
C = 120

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find the number of rabbits:
R = D + C - 12
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

Now that we have the values for D, C, and R, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total pets = D + C + R
Total pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total pets = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80. 

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys, which is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. The number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout, which is 120 - 80 = 40.

Harry slept 9 hours. 
2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 
9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of canned tomatoes she started with. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce must have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (because 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we know that each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we can divide the total ounces of canned tomatoes (64) by the ounces per can (16). This gives us 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes. This gives us 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. We subtract these 5 cars from the original 30 cars to find out how many cars actually drove through the traffic jam. 

30 (original cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 25 cars

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the 20 cars from the 25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

25 (cars that drove through the traffic jam) - 20 (cars in the remaining 15 minutes) = 5 cars

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also has a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends, but since he has soda on one of the weekend dinner, we subtract 1 glass of water from the weekend total, making it 7 - 1 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week: 20 + 6 = 26.

Inner width = 6 - 2 * 1 = 4 inches

Inner height = Outer height - 2 * Wall thickness
Inner height = 4 - 2 * 1 = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total inner volume = Inner volume * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the original cost (100% original + 50% increase). 
The selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Since the ratio is in terms of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up the following equation:

20x = 120

where x is the value of one part.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's initial salary, then calculate Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

Adrien's initial salary was $40000. Since Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Adrien's initial salary was $40000. Four years later, his salary had increased by 40%, so we can calculate his new salary:

Adrien's new salary = $40000 + 40% of $40000
Adrien's new salary = $40000 + 0.4 * $40000
Adrien's new salary = $40000 + $16000
Adrien's new salary = $56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume the same percentage increase for Lylah. However, we are not given the percentage increase for Lylah. We can only assume that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initially and 40% higher than his previous salary. We cannot assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. However, we can calculate the percentage increase for Lylah that would keep the 30% difference between their salaries.

Let's assume Lylah's new salary is x. Since Adrien's new salary is $56000 and it is 30% higher than Lylah's new salary, we can set up the equation:

$56000 = x + 30% of x
$56000 = x + 0.3x
$56000 = 1.3x
x = $56000 / 1.3
x = $43077 (approximately)

However, this is not the correct way to calculate Lylah's new salary. We should calculate the percentage increase for Lylah that would keep the 30% difference between their salaries. 

Let's assume Lylah's new salary is x. Since Adrien's new salary is $56000 and it is 30% higher than Lylah's new salary, we can set up the equation:

$56000 = x + 30% of x
$56000 = x + 0.3x
$56000 = 1.3x
x = $56000 / 1.3
x = $43077 (approximately)

However, we can calculate Lylah's new salary by using the initial salary and the percentage increase that would keep the 30% difference between their salaries.

Lylah's initial salary was $30769. We can calculate the percentage increase for Lylah that would keep the 30% difference between their salaries.

Let's assume the percentage increase for Lylah is y. We can set up the equation:

$56000 = $30769 * (1 + y) * 1.3
$56000 = $30769 * (1 + y) * 1.3
$56000 / $30769 = (1 + y) * 1.3
1.816 = (1 + y) * 1.3
1.816 / 1.3 = 1 + y
1.398 = 1 + y
y = 1.398 - 1
y = 0.398 or 39.8%

Lylah's new salary = $30769 + 39.8% of $30769
Lylah's new salary = $30769 + 0.398 * $30769
Lylah's new salary = $30769 + $12251
Lylah's new salary = $43020

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56000 + $43020
Total salary = $99020

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week. 

Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 
Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her run into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. To find one-third of 60, we can divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.

30 - 20 = 10

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, the total number of spoons she had when setting the table is the sum of the spoons in her package and her husband's package, minus the 3 spoons she used.

We can write this as an equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine the constants: x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10."

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

Let's start by finding the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is:

Watermelon cost = 3 * Pepper cost
Watermelon cost = 3 * $15
Watermelon cost = $45

Next, we'll find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, the cost of an orange is:

Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
Orange cost = $45 - $5
Orange cost = $40

Now that we have the cost of each item, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

Total cost = (4 * Watermelon cost) + (20 * Pepper cost) + (10 * Orange cost)
Total cost = (4 * $45) + (20 * $15) + (10 * $40)
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to get the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28

2 bags of chips for $1.50 each = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee:
Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. 
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200. 
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the non-food cost:

Kim has 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of each pack of cloths is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92, and profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. So, the profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is (1/2) * 30 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive flew from the hive and left. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours but hadn't already returned. 
In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 returned in the next 6 hours. So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned yet.
Then, in the next 6 hours, 60 more bees left the hive. 
So, the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours but hadn't already returned is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

First, we know that after the ants took one french fry, there were 5 left. So before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then, the raccoon took 2/3x fries, and 1/3x fries remained. We know that 1/3x = 6. To find x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 6 * 3 = 18.

So, before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons. So, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

This is the number of fries after Dave ate 14. To find the initial number of fries, we add the 14 that Dave ate: 34 + 14 = 48.

17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet

Now, we need to find two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday:
Two-thirds of 24 feet = (2/3) * 24 feet = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin separately and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the number of 2-month periods and then apply the compound interest formula.

36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

The interest rate per period is 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.

The formula for compound interest is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

However, in this case, the interest rate is a percentage of the original price, not the current price. So, we need to adjust the formula to A = P * (1 + r)^n, where r is the interest rate as a decimal, but the interest is added to the original price, not the current price.

A = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 is incorrect, instead we should calculate the interest for each period and add it to the original price.

A = 20 + (20 * 0.20) * (1 + 1)^17

   = 20 + 4 * 131072

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and add them up.

We know that one red car costs $4, so the total cost of 5 red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

We also know that one action figure costs $5, so the total cost of 3 action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: 
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment per month. 

Minimum payment per month for student loans: $300
Minimum payment per month for credit card: $200
Minimum payment per month for mortgage: $500

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment per month.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment per month to get the new monthly payment.

New monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the total yearly payment, we multiply the new monthly payment by 12.

Total yearly payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine how many gallons of lemonade they made. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

They made a total profit of $25. Since the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons they made is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 5 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 5 * $3 = $15.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is (1/4) * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is (1/3) * 6000 = 2000$.

Total expenses so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

Remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is (1/2) * 2500 = 1250$.

Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so total given to family: 200 + 700 = 900$.

Remaining amount after giving to family: 1250 - 900 = 350$.

"To find the total number of crabs, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has. 

We know Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate the total hours he worked and multiply it by his hourly wage.

In the first week, Lloyd worked 5 hours, and in the second week, he worked 8 hours. So, the total hours he worked is:
5 hours + 8 hours = 13 hours

Now, we multiply the total hours by his hourly wage:
13 hours * $10/hour = $130

$130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80 
= 3 * 20 
= 60

Since the total number of students who voted is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of students who voted - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'w', the number of red roses as 'r', and the number of pink calla lilies as 'p'.

We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so we can write an equation:
r = 4w

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations:
p = 5w
200 = 5w

Now, we can solve for 'w' using the second equation:
w = 200 / 5
w = 40

Now that we know 'w', we can find 'r' using the first equation:
r = 4w
r = 4 * 40
r = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. 

Since two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's denote Mark's age two years ago as M. We know that half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. 

The equation becomes: M = 14 + 5
M = 19

This is Mark's age two years ago. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to M: 
Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark. To find Jean's age, we add 2 years to Mark's current age: 
Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we multiply the time taken by each member (55 seconds) by the number of members (4). 

Total time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we calculate the time taken by each member:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the total time taken by the well-rounded team from the total time taken by the less well-rounded team:
Difference in time = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

However, the question asks for how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is actually the slower team in this case, we need to find the difference between the less well-rounded team and the well-rounded team.

"To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
Probability = 3 / 6
Probability = 0.5

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability percentage = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Now, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. 

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for the first roll and 3 favorable outcomes for the second roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities:

Probability = (3/6) * (3/6)
Probability = (1/2) * (1/2)
Probability = 1/4
Probability = 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability percentage = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

Now, let's calculate the difference in percentages:

Difference in percentage = Probability percentage of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability percentage of rolling two even numbers in a row
Difference in percentage = 50% - 25%
Difference in percentage = 25%

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked and add that to the number of apples her mom picked.

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20): 10 + 20 = 30.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to first find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters, then subtract that from the total number of pieces of straw distributed. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3x. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 18x + 50.

We are also given that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. 

The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160, so we can set up the equation:

18x + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine the constants on the left side:

18x + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18x = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 5

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The principal amount (P) is $100, the monthly interest rate (r) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (t) is 3 months.

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = P * r * t

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost price per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost first. 

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. 
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find the total amount of insects the ducks need per week, we multiply the amount of insects one duck needs per week by the number of ducks. 

3.5 pounds/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total amount of insects the ducks need per week by 7 to find the amount they need per day.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net gain in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total number of trees Tom has planted is 10 * 10 = 100 trees, and the total number of trees he has chopped down is 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The net gain in trees after 10 years is 100 - 20 = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To find the number of white flamingos, we need to calculate one third of the original 18 flamingos. 

One third of 18 is 18 / 3 = 6. 

So, the neighbors took back 6 flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out on Sue's front yard. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of flamingos on Sunday morning before noon. 

Initially, there were 18 flamingos. 6 of them were taken back and painted white, so the number of pink flamingos left was 18 - 6 = 12. 

Then, 6 white flamingos were added to the yard, and 18 more pink flamingos were added. 

So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30. 

The total number of white flamingos is 6. 

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total pounds of carrots used will be 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds.

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find the pounds of carrots that will not be used.

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to her initial collection.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add the cards she collected each month to her initial collection: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and the rate he is paid by each publisher.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B is also x.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

So Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Now, we can calculate Mark's total earnings for the week:

Earnings from Publisher A = 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents
Earnings from Publisher B = 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
= 2500 cents + 5000 cents
= 7500 cents

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon, so the total number of pails he gets every day is:
5 (morning) + 6 (afternoon) = 11 pails

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total number of liters of water he gets every day is:
11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

"To calculate John's total annual salary, we first need to calculate his annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary before the raise is:

$2000/week * 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

Next, we need to calculate the 5% raise. A 5% raise means his new salary will be 105% of his old salary. 

$104,000/year * 1.05 = $109,200/year

However, since he got the award on the first day of the year, he will only receive the raise for the rest of the year, not the entire year. To calculate the amount he will receive from the raise, we need to calculate the amount he would have made in a year without the raise, and subtract that from the amount he will make with the raise.

Since he got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive 51 weeks of his old salary and 1 week of his new salary. 

$2000/week * 51 weeks = $102,000
$2000/week * 1.05 * 1 week = $2100
$102,000 + $2100 = $104,100

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the amount he will receive from the raise. We should calculate the amount he will receive from the raise by calculating the difference between his new salary and his old salary for the rest of the year.

$2000/week * 1.05 = $2100/week
$2100/week - $2000/week = $100/week
$100/week * 51 weeks = $5100

Now we can calculate his total annual salary by adding the amount he would have made in a year without the raise, the amount he will receive from the raise, and the one-time bonus.

$104,000 + $5100 + $5000 = $109,100"

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. 
2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
3 slices/day * 3 days = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to determine the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. 

Since there are six tests and she can remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of the five highest scores. The desired average is 93, so the total score of the five highest tests should be 5 * 93 = 465.

Now, let's arrange Brinley's scores in ascending order: 71, 86, 89, 92, 100. The lowest score is 71, which will be removed. The sum of the remaining four scores is 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 367.

To achieve a total score of 465, Brinley needs a score on the sixth test such that 367 + x = 465, where x is the score on the sixth test.

Solving for x, we get x = 465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

Distance covered in the first four weeks: 
Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, so the total number of rides is 5 * 4 = 20 rides.
Distance covered in each ride is 25 kilometers.
Total distance covered in the first four weeks = 20 rides * 25 kilometers/ride = 500 kilometers.

Distance covered in the next three weeks: 
Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, so the total number of rides is 2 * 3 = 6 rides.
Distance covered in each ride is 60 kilometers.
Total distance covered in the next three weeks = 6 rides * 60 kilometers/ride = 360 kilometers.

Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first four weeks + Distance covered in the next three weeks
Total distance covered = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers
Total distance covered = 860 kilometers

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then find the cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. There are 20 dozen cups, which is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

The cost of each cup is the total cost of twenty dozen cups divided by the number of cups. So, the cost of each cup is $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, and Sara already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations with two variables. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. 

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write the first equation as:
w = r + 2

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs in total, so we can write the second equation as:
3r + 5w = 42

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' from the first equation into the second equation:
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:
3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:
8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:
8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:
r = 4

Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know the distance Gary needs to cover. To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. After 4 minutes, the small pool will lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons, and the big pool will also lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the small pool now has:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Since one-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean and another one-third went inside the cave, we subtract 2 * 12 penguins from the total number of penguins.
36 - 2 * 12 = 36 - 24 = 12

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his total weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his daily consumption is 6 tomatoes. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly consumption is 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats. So, his girlfriend's weekly consumption is 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week.

The total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week.

Number of vines needed = Total weekly consumption / Tomatoes produced per vine per week
= 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week
= 21 vines

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we first need to find out the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices required is 20 * 4 = 80.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 80 / 8 = 10.

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the empty pens.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. 

So, the number of new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens is 25 / 5 = 5.

Now, Ram has the initial 25 pens and the 5 new pens he made, plus the 5 new pens he made will also run out of ink and can be used to make 1 more pen (5 / 5 = 1).

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first refill) + 1 (new pen from the second refill) = 31.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan. 

We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through exits A and B first.

Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 1000

= 300

Number of students remaining after exit A = 1000 - 300
= 700

Number of students who went out through exit B = 3/5 of 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420

Number of students remaining after exit B = 700 - 420

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has:

27 + 6 = 33 candies

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

54 - 33 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. 

Dolly has 2 books of her own and 1 book from Pandora, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book of her own and 2 books from Dolly, so she reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Since they collectively read their own and each other's books, the total number of books read is the sum of the books read by Dolly and Pandora, which is 3 + 3 = 6.

However, this counts each book twice (once for each person), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the actual number of unique books read. But in this case, we are counting the number of times a book is read, not the number of unique books. So the correct answer is the total number of times a book is read.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert the time it takes to write those pages from minutes to hours.

First, let's find out how many pen pals Mike has left: 5 - 2 = 3.

Since each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes half of the total pages, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pages.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

30 days * 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes he used is:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes he used from his monthly limit:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. Since Billy took twice as many as Kyle, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Now, Griffin initially had 24 fries. After Kyle and Billy took their fries, Griffin had 24 - 5 - 10 = 9 fries.

We also know that Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now, Griffin had 9 fries and Colby took 2, so Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries before Ginger gave him some.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. We can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.
The total calories her sister consumed = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we can find the number of girls in the third class by subtracting the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so B = A + 4.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is B/2.

Now, we can solve the equation A + 8 = 52 to find the number of apples Jamal has:

B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, the number of bananas Andrea has is:
B/2 = 48/2
B/2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 small holes * 3 minutes/small hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 large holes * 10 minutes/large hole = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first know that the sum of their current ages is 20. 

In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will have aged 10 years each. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current total age.

Current sum of their ages: 20
Additional years for Mico: 10
Additional years for Marco: 10
Total additional years: 10 + 10 = 20

Now, we add the total additional years to their current sum of ages:
20 (current sum) + 20 (total additional years) = 40

The sum of their ages in 10 years is 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can express this as:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100

Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of people attending. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

The total number of people attending is the sum of team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find the total length of the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the sterling silver beads. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace, we get 25 - 8 = 17 inches. This is the total length of the sterling silver beads.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total length of the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads. 

Number of beads = 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot. 

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Since they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, we need to multiply the number of stories written by each in the first week by 2 and then add them together.

Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Now, we add the number of stories written in the second week.
40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her coins. 

The value of a quarter is 25 cents, and she has 5 quarters, so 5 * 25 = 125 cents. 
The value of a dime is 10 cents, and she has 2 dimes, so 2 * 10 = 20 cents. 

Now, let's add the values of her quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly has 145 cents initially. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost from her initial amount: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, we subtract the total stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

"To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together. We know Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Now, let's add the number of medals Ali and Izzy have: 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as x. We can set up the equation: x - 10x = 39. However, this equation is not correct. The correct equation should be x = 10 * 39.

x = 10 * 39
x = 390

The total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we need to first determine the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. 

Total chocolate bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

The remaining chocolate bars will be shared among the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars given to adults
= 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars
= 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them.

Chocolate bars per child = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children
= 16 chocolate bars / 8 children
= 2 chocolate bars/child

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to first determine the total time she spent working. She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she took a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes (break) = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals
Earnings per interval = $5
Total earnings = 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to calculate the points for each player first.

Mike has 21 points initially. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and there are 50 unsold books left. So, the total number of books sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200. 

Since she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. Five times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than that, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of players on the offense as O, the number of players on the defense as D, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can write the equation:
O + D + S = 105

We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so we can write the equation:
O = 2D

We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write the equation:
S = D/2

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to get:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + 2D + D)/2 = 105
(7D)/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2:
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

Cost = Volume × Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 × $0.1
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
= 3 * 30
= 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's set up a proportion to represent the situation:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Total number of electric poles required: 15"
"To find the number of women left, we first need to find the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:
1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
10 - 3 = 7 women

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is:
15 - 7 = 8

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine by dividing the cost of the book by 2.

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we can subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine.

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes, we need to subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils she has. 

Jam has 26 pencils in total and 2 of them are loose, so the number of pencils in boxes is 26 - 2 = 24.

Since Jam has 3 boxes, the number of pencils in each box is 24 / 3 = 8.

Now, we know that each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils, we need to add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have and divide by the number of pencils each box can hold.

Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils in total.

The number of boxes needed is 72 / 8 = 9.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide the total cooling required (65 degrees) by the cooling effect of each ice cube (13 degrees):

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening effect of 5 ice cubes is:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 milliliters (ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (cream) = 75 milliliters

"To solve this problem, we can set up a simple equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of old records the 5 people brought in as 'x'. Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the number of new records they can get is x/2.

We are given that the 5 people left with 7 new records between them. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Since the bus started at the terminal, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To calculate the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to determine the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received from the rewards and the coupon.

The customer earned rewards of $1 off for every $20 they spent on their last shopping trip. They spent $80, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards, which is equivalent to $4 off.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. The total discount from the rewards is $4.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount the customer received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is $43 (initial price) - $12 (total discount) = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income: $42,000/year
Property tax: $6,000
Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to calculate the difference between the two jobs.

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names, as 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider 'RJ' as 'Richard' and use the value 5 for Richard.

So, the total number of guns is: 
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard, but we'll use 5 for Richard) + 5 (Richard) = 8 + 10 + 5 = 23

However, we'll correct the total by removing the extra value for Richard: 
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) = 23

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

23 / 4 = 5.75

Since you can't divide a gun, we'll round down to 5 guns per person, with 3 guns left over."

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are 3 groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we know that the smallest group has 'x - 10' students. So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 60

We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the second equation as:

c = 2w

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 'w':

2w + w = 60
3w = 60
w = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

c = 2w
c = 2(20)
c = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we can multiply the number of chickens by 2 and the number of cows by 4, then add the results:

Total legs = (2 * 40) + (4 * 20)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find out how many balls Josh starts to juggle on stage, we need to determine how many balls he had before he dropped them.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks is:
3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 + 4 = 7

When Josh drops 3 balls, 2 are caught by the crowd, and 1 is lost. So, he is left with:
7 - 3 = 4 (dropped)
4 + 2 (caught) = 6 (total balls he has now, including the ones caught by the crowd)
However, Josh only has the balls that are with him on stage, so we subtract the 2 caught by the crowd:

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, and the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:
240 pounds (animals) + 20 pounds (container) = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance covered, we first need to calculate the new daily distance. Since the coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters, we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original distance.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters.

The new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered is 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"To find the price of Juice Box B, we need to add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A. 
Price of Juice Box A = 4 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + 5 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = 4 dollars + 5 dollars
Price of Juice Box B = 9 dollars

To find the price of Juice Box C, we need to add 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A.
Price of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + 7 dollars
Price of Juice Box C = 4 dollars + 7 dollars
Price of Juice Box C = 11 dollars

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C.
Difference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B

"To find the percentage change in daily profit, we first need to calculate the daily profit when the factory made tractors and when they made silos.

Daily profit when making tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Daily profit when making silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we can calculate the difference in daily profit: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage change, we divide the difference by the original daily profit and multiply by 100:
($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses first. 

The cost of food per month is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost of food per month is 25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is $20, and the cost of medicine per month is $100. 

So, the total monthly expenses for Madeline's dog is 100 (food) + 20 (treats) + 100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total amount spent per year, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, so they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Total plant pots needed = 30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows. 
The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3 * Total time = 15 hours
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing. 
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so her earnings are:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be $2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

"To find the age of Carver's son, let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

The age of Carver's son is 25 years.

"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Number of days = 18,000 / 900 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, which is 3.

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5. 
So, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. 
So, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for these three reasons: 
3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

Total revenue: Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so 3 pitchers hold 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

Total profit: Total revenue - Total cost = $36 - $18 = $18

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups of lemonade, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Profit per hour: Total profit / Total hours = $18 / 9 = $2

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to calculate the number of female choir members and then subtract the ones who couldn't make it, and finally add the teachers.

First, we find the number of female choir members: 50% of 52 members are girls. 
50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Then, half of the female members can't make it to the show: 
26 / 2 = 13

So, the number of female members who made it to the show is: 
26 - 13 = 13

The 3 teachers also sang with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is: 
13 + 3 = 16

159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of test scores (5):
400 / 5 = 80

His current math grade is:

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
= 66 / 3
= 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
= 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of Dasha's tickets and compare it to the cost of David's ride bracelet.

Since each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides, Dasha will need 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. 
The cost of these tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30.

The difference in cost between Dasha's tickets and David's ride bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of each part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio:

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of each part, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

"To calculate the savings, we need to first calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling. 
The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The 20% discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The cost of the cable package is $60. 
The savings is the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services, which is $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first calculate the total time she spent on the task. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording it. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Total time spent = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and finally add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so the total number of cards she had initially is:
20 (cards she made) + 2 * 15 (cards her dad brought) = 20 + 30 = 50

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so the total number of cards she passed out is:
24 + 5 = 29

Now, subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had initially:
50 - 29 = 21

Finally, add the cards she received from family and friends:

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first determine how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we multiply 12 by 1/3 to find out how many slices Bill got: 
12 * 1/3 = 12/3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We multiply 12 by 1/4 to find out how many slices Mark got: 
12 * 1/4 = 12/4 = 3 slices

Now, we add the slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark: 
4 slices (Bill) + 3 slices (Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is: 
7 slices (Bill and Mark) + 2 slices (Jenny) = 9 slices

Since the pizza has 12 slices, we subtract the slices eaten or given away from the total: 
12 slices - 9 slices = 3 slices

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save and then divide that by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 in his bank account, and the bike costs $300. So, the amount he still needs to save is:
$300 (bike cost) - $50 (initial savings) = $250

Now, we divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10):
$250 / $10 = 25

So, Mark needs to save his money for 25 days.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs separately.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders.

Next, we need to find the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can multiply the number of spiders by 1/3:

Millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 90 / 3 = 30

Now, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

Stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Finally, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. To confirm the calculation, let's calculate the total number of days he works in a year based on this information:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Since the problem states the builder works 4 weeks every month, we will use the second calculation.

Now, we multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by 2 to find the number of bags needed:

12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk required by 2 to find the number of bottles needed:

4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags:

6 bags - 2 bottles = 4

"To calculate the energy consumption, we first need to find the total watt-hours (Wh) used by the air conditioner in a day. 

Initially, Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. 
Energy consumption per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh

If he reduces the time by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
New energy consumption per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

The energy saved per day = Initial energy consumption - New energy consumption
= 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh
= 4500 Wh

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000 (since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).
Energy saved per day (in kWh) = 4500 Wh / 1000
= 4.5 kWh

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30.
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh * 30
= 135 kWh

- Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- One zebra has 36 stripes.
- Another zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches required and the total amount of meat and cheese needed.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves to find the number of sandwiches needed:
20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we can multiply the number of sandwiches by the amount of meat and cheese per sandwich to find the total amount of each:
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can multiply the total amount of meat and cheese by their respective costs to find the total cost:
5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we can add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then calculate the new quantities after the purchase.

Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C and the initial number of corns as X. We are given that there is twice as much corn as cannolis, so we can write an equation:

X = 2C

We are also given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis initially, so C = 40. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

X = 2(40)
X = 80

So, Allan initially had 80 corns and 40 cannolis.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the new number of cannolis is:
C_new = C + 60
= 40 + 60
= 100

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
X_new = X - 40
However, this is incorrect as the question states he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. So the correct equation is 
X_new = 60 - 40 
= 20 + 80 
= 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
Total = X_new + C_new

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he took before the jog. 

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps, and he has 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, before the jog, he took 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog (8,000).

Next, we calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we add the travel time to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we subtract the total time from the available time:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The probability of a candle exploding is 1% (100% - 99% guaranteed not to explode). 
The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5%.

Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities:
Probability of a candle exploding and smelling like wet dog = 1% * 5% = 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half this amount (30 / 2 = 15) from the shortest trees.
- Let's denote the number of apples she gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60).
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45).
- No apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(Joanne's apples from the tallest trees) + (Joanne's apples from the shortest trees) + (Joanne's apples from the average trees) + (Sister's apples from the tallest trees) + (Sister's apples from the shortest trees) = 500

Substituting the given values:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine the constants:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the first equation as:

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, and there are 304 humps in total. So, we can write the second equation as:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we have the value of 'c', we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of 'd':
c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days (since the first week already had 7 days), so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the normal rate period, and the increased rate period.

1. Introductory period (6 months): 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. Normal rate period (8 months): 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. Increased rate period: Since Bill signed up for 2 years (24 months), and we've already accounted for 6 + 8 = 14 months, the remaining months at the increased rate would be 24 - 14 = 10 months. 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as J and the original price of the tattered jeans as T. We know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 of the total savings from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total savings:

(J - 22) + (T - 28) = 6

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, we can write:

(J - 22) = (1/3) * 6
(J - 22) = 2

J = 24

Since Cole saved 2/3 of the total savings from the tattered jeans, we can write:

(T - 28) = (2/3) * 6
(T - 28) = 4

T = 32

The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

32 - 24 = 8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost $24 and the tattered jeans originally cost $32, the jogger jeans actually cost less than the tattered jeans. The difference is $8, but the jogger jeans cost $8 less than the tattered jeans."
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibuses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the bird feeders she made and the ones she bought.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the bird feeders she made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to both types of bird feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of the soup and the cake, then add them to the cost of the bagel.

The bagel costs $4. 
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then we add $1 to the cost of the bagel to get the cost of the soup: $4 + $1 = $5.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, the soup, and the cake to get the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount Kenny needs to buy the ticket and have $50 in spending cash. 
Total amount = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
Total amount = $100 + $50
Total amount = $150

Since Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each, we can set up an equation to find the total number of cards he sold. 
Let's denote the total number of cards he sold as x.
Total amount = 1.5x
$150 = 1.5x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.5.
x = $150 / 1.5
x = 100

However, this is the number of cards Kenny sold, not the total number of cards he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards.
Let's denote the total number of cards as y.
2/3 * y = 100

To find y, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.
y = 100 * (3/2)
y = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs that were not available for the guests is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog was missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of missing hotdogs, which is 26.

However, this is not the case. The correct way to solve this problem is to find the number of guests who got a second hotdog and subtract that from the total number of guests.

The caterer had 54 hotdogs, and each guest got at least one hotdog. So, the number of hotdogs left for the second serving is 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs.

Since each guest who got a second hotdog got one hotdog, the number of guests who got a second hotdog is 14 + the number of guests who initially got two hotdogs is not relevant here, but the number of hotdogs they got is. The 18 guests who initially got two hotdogs, got 18 hotdogs in the first serving and 18 hotdogs in the second serving, but the caterer only had 14 hotdogs left for the second serving, so the 18 guests who initially got two hotdogs, got 14 hotdogs in the second serving and 4 of them did not get a second hotdog.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent $5 - (1% of $5) = $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

We know that chips cost 40 cents and candy bars cost 75 cents. Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. Since George bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 cents = 120 cents = $1.20.

The total cost of candy bars is 75x cents. The total amount spent is $4.95, so we can set up the equation:

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length. Plugging in the values, we get Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length (9 feet) and width (40 feet), we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth bought a total of:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth bought a total of:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth bought = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth bought - Total beads Elizabeth bought
= 140 - 60
= 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find the time it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
- James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 
- James' swim time = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
- James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' total time. We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
- James' total time = 170 + 10 
- James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' time for the run by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
- James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
- James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
- James' run time = 180 - 121
- James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we first need to find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we multiply the length of Movie B by 1/4 or 0.25.

Movie A = 80 minutes * 0.25 = 20 minutes

"To find the total distance the horse runs, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours and then multiply it by the speed.

Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5 = $30

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:
Change = Total money - Cost = $30 - $24 = $6

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option and the regular ticket option.

The super ticket option costs $20 for the ticket and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda, so the total cost is $21.

Since you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular ticket option costs $12 for the ticket, and you also bought a soda for $3, so the remaining cost for the popcorn is $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

Regular price of popcorn: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 
$900 / 20 balloons = $45 per balloon.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
$45 per balloon + $20 per balloon = $65 per balloon.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:
$65 per balloon * 170 balloons = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to first find out how many apples they eat in a day together, then multiply that by 30.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day.

Now, we multiply the number of apples they eat in a day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

The cost of each bag of potting soil is $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total Cost = 160 * 12
Total Cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's load capacity.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's load capacity to determine the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Load capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. In this case, the result is a whole number.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 5 - 2
(x/2) = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate x:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

Let's use a Venn diagram approach. We have two sets: A (kids allergic to dairy) and B (kids allergic to peanuts). We know that:

- |A| = 9 (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- |B| = 6 (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- |A ∩ B| = 3 (number of kids allergic to both)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of kids allergic to at least one thing:

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

"To find out how many songs Luri can add, we first need to determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we multiply 20 by 3 to find Luri's total songs.

20 * 3 = 60

Now, we know Luri has 60 songs. To find out how many more songs he can add, we subtract 60 from the maximum capacity of 100.

100 - 60 = 40

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs to his player.

Now, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add to find the difference.

80 - 40 = 40

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

First, let's find the number of oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, we can multiply the total number of oranges by 2/5.

Total oranges = 60
Oranges eaten by Stetson = (2/5) * 60
Oranges eaten by Stetson = (2 * 60) / 5
Oranges eaten by Stetson = 120 / 5
Oranges eaten by Stetson = 24

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by $10.

Total amount given up = Oranges eaten by Stetson * $10
Total amount given up = 24 * $10
Total amount given up = $240

"To find the total hours James runs a week, we need to first find the total miles he runs a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can divide the total miles he runs a week by his speed to find the total hours he runs a week. 

60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, the total amount of oats each horse consumes in a day is:
5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is:
10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day

To find the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we know that one bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days by the weight of one bag:
200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to first find the number of Pomeranians and then find one third of that number.

Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find two thirds of 27, we multiply 27 by 2/3.

27 * 2/3 = 27 * 2 / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find one third of 18.

18 * 1/3 = 18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we first need to calculate the remaining amount needed. 

The cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount he already has from the cost of the toy car:
$12 - $4 = $8

Now, we know the child needs to save $8 more. Since he saves $2 daily, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days:
$8 ÷ $2 = 4

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, the total number of eggs that can be placed is:

2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free promotion, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th is 60"" tall, we can calculate the total height as follows:

Bottom 4 cheerleaders: 4 * 64"" = 256""
Middle 3 cheerleaders: 3 * 64"" = 192""
Top 2 cheerleaders: 2 * 64"" = 128""
Topmost cheerleader: 60""

Total height in inches: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine Angela's age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can set up the equation:

Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in 4 years = 42

Since this is Angela's age in four years, we need to subtract 4 from this to find her current age:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in 4 years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

However, we also need to consider Brett's age increase in those 4 years. Since Brett is 14 now, in 4 years he will be 18. Angela's age in 4 years should be 3 times Brett's current age, not his age in 4 years. But the problem states that in 4 years Angela will be 3 times as old as Brett is now. So we need to find Angela's age in 4 years and subtract 4 from it.

Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in 4 years = 42

Now, we add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges to find the total number of oranges.
Total oranges = 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find the number of pies they can make.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
L + D + B = 43

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write the equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation:
D = B/2 or 2D = B

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + B + 7 = 43
Subtract 7 from both sides:
2D + B = 36

Now we can substitute the third equation into the above equation:
2D + 2D = 36
Combine like terms:
4D = 36
Divide both sides by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total yards used:

(3/4) * 364 = (3 * 364) / 4
= 1092 / 4
= 273

The total yards of yarn used is 273."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for her friends and the additional random gifts.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total gifts are 2 * 5 = 10.
For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total gifts are 3 * 2 = 6.
The total gifts for her friends are 10 + 6 = 16.
Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

Width of rug = Width of chair + 5
Width of rug = 3 + 5
Width of rug = 8

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as follows:

Length of couch = 2 * Width of rug + 2
Length of couch = 2 * 8 + 2
Length of couch = 16 + 2
Length of couch = 18

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost of strawberry gum is 2x.

We also know that she bought a pack of grape gum for $2 and a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of all the gum packs is $7. We can set up the equation as follows:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the optimal combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood that he can buy with his $24 budget.

Let's analyze the cost per stick for each type of wood:
- 2 x 4: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
- 2 x 8: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the cheapest option. However, we need to check if Frederick can afford to buy 2 x 8 pieces of wood with his budget.

The maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy is:
$24 / $6 = 4

The total number of sticks he can get from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood is:
4 * 400 = 1600

However, we should also check if buying a combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood would provide more sticks. Since the 2 x 8 is the cheapest option, buying any 2 x 4 would not increase the total number of sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

"To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to determine the total number of snowshoes needed and multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, but a pair of snowshoes is required for 2 legs. So, each dog needs 4 / 2 = 2 pairs of snowshoes.

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed is 6 * 2 = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of her bus trips per day is:
2 trips/day * $2.20/trip = $4.40/day

Since she takes the bus 5 days a week, the total cost of her bus trips per week is:
$4.40/day * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, let's subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought individually.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion for each item.

For onions: 
Let's say Sophia bought x onions. Then Rose bought 4x onions. We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can set up the equation:
4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So Sophia bought 3 onions.

For potatoes:
Let's say Sophia bought y potatoes. Then Rose bought 4y potatoes. We know Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can set up the equation:
4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So Sophia bought 1 potato.

Now, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding the number of onions and potatoes:
Total = 3 (onions) + 1 (potatoes)
Total = 4

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to first determine the total number of days he has to achieve his goal. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days (December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and 19 days in July).

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

Now, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit: 105,000 calories / 201 days = approximately 522 calories/day.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find half of it, and finally calculate 2/5 of the remaining amount.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48. 
To find the amount of money he has after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining amount: $80 - $48 = $32.

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we will divide 9 cups by 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts/week - 2016 kilowatts/week = 336 kilowatts/week.

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, we can calculate the total hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house:

120 hours * 2 (since a whole house is twice as big as half a house) = 240 hours

Now, we know that 5 people are working together to paint the whole house. To calculate the total hours it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take for one person by 5:

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the headphone set costs $44. 

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. We can divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of a CD:

Number of CDs = 44 / 4
Number of CDs = 11

Now, subtract $1,800 from both sides:
2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

Since April has 30 days, the first half will have 15 days and the second half will also have 15 days.

The total savings in the first half will be 15x, and the total savings in the second half will be 15(2x) = 30x.

The sum of the total savings in both halves should equal the monthly target of $1125. We can set up an equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to multiply the number of each fruit by its cost and add them together.

The cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of the oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of the peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

To find the change Verna received, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave.

Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how much Jairus and Jenny each get, we need to multiply the amount they get per task by the number of tasks they completed.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he gets 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she gets 0.5 * 20 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

"To solve this problem, let's use a simple linear equation. 

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:
4x = 4(20) = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles walked by Jeff, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Distance to work: 3 miles

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the steps:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: The alphabet has 26 letters. Writing it twice means 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of it once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, we add the initial 52 letters, the 13 letters, and the re-written 65 letters: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

Total number of letters Elise has written: 130"
"To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. This is a classic example of a geometric sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant.

In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is also 3, since each family calls 3 other families.

The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is: an = a * r^(n-1)

Since we want to find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to find the fourth term (n=4) of the sequence.

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

However, this is the total number of new families notified in the fourth round, plus the 3^3 = 27 families from the previous round that are making the calls. So the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Total weight lost = Weight lost per month * Number of months
Total weight lost = 10 * 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight.
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

"Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James has 80 toys, five times that amount is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this amount, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first calculate the total cost without the discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost without discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend.
Final amount = Total cost - Discount amount = $30 - $3 = $27

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:
2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles he needs is:
70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy:
140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this, we get 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

However, the question asks about a hot day, but the given information is about cold and warm water. Since there's no information about hot water, we'll assume the warm water time is the closest given data point for a hot day.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, he would take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day (using the warm water time), Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, he would take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between a hot day and a cold day is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, we multiply the number of buttons with 4 holes by 4:
14 * 4 = 56 holes

Now, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons:

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, her reading speed is 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying the total time she spent reading by her reading speed: 105 minutes * 1.33 pages/minute = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide $70 by 7 to find out how much he can spend each day:
$70 ÷ 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since he spent $10 per day for 4 days, he spent a total of:
$10 per day × 4 days = $40

The number of wooden action figures he bought is:
$40 ÷ $5 per action figure = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $40 = $30 left to spend. Since he wants to spend $10 per day for the remaining 3 days, he can spend the remaining $30. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
$30 ÷ $2 per action figure = 15 plastic action figures

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures:

"To find out how much John and Jill earned, we need to calculate the total hours they worked and multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours are 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours are 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns and then convert that to the amount of water she needs.

First, let's calculate the total calories she burns from aerobics: 
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Next, let's calculate the total calories she burns from running: 
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, let's add the calories from aerobics and running to get the total calories burned: 
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned: 
1600 calories / 200 calories/unit = 8 units

Now, we multiply the number of units by the amount of water she needs per unit: 
8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red jelly beans as R, the number of blue jelly beans as B, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

From the note on the jar, we know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:

G = 1.01B

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

R + B + G = 4500

Substituting the expressions for R and G in terms of B, we get:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
8.75 pounds (gained) - (-6.25 pounds) (lost) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 
The total cost on Amazon is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, the shipping cost on eBay is $4 * 2 = $8. 
The total cost on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay. 
The difference in cost is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet.

Day 1: 4 feet (initial height)
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since the beanstalk is 32 feet tall on the 4th day, which is taller than Mark's window (20 feet), we can conclude that it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find the amount of protein John gets per day, we need to first find the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms is 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, the amount of protein he gets per day is 200 grams * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work: 
$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle, which is 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

- 14 nickels = 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his production rate per hour is:
120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes:
(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds in 2 hours
Her production rate per hour is:
90 pounds / 2 hours = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours):
Ruiz's total production: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production: 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Since the research took 10 times the initial duration, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 
The initial 5 months are already accounted for, so the additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The funding for the additional months is 50% more than the initial funding. 
50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the funding for the additional months is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately, then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 * 3 = 30

In the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 * 4 = 24

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total number of cars towed that week:
30 + 24 = 54

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then find the difference between the required height and Adam's current height.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's find the difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take him to reach the required height:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

"To calculate James' commission, we first need to find the profit made by the company on each car. 

The cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The profit on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the price of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * 2000
= 1600

Now, we are given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - 400
= 1600 - 400
= 1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to determine the relative speed between the two and then divide the distance between them by this relative speed.

The relative speed is the difference between Tom's speed and Bob's speed, since they are moving in the same direction. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can divide the distance between them by the relative speed to find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 * 4
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To find Lynn's distance, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

Let's denote the cost of one apple as 'a' and the cost of one orange as 'o'. We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

4a = 5.20
3o = 3.30

To find the cost of one apple, we divide both sides of the first equation by 4:
a = 5.20 / 4
a = 1.30

To find the cost of one orange, we divide both sides of the second equation by 3:
o = 3.30 / 3
o = 1.10

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Cost = 5a + 5o
Cost = 5(1.30) + 5(1.10)
Cost = 6.50 + 5.50
Cost = 12.00

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the time it takes Bob to shovel a cubic foot of earth:
Time = Volume * time per cubic foot

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade = (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price:
$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary. 

5% of $20000 is 0.05 * $20000 = $1000. 
New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Since the bonus is half a month's salary, the bonus is $21000 / 2 = $10500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21000 + $10500 = $31500.

However, the bonus is not a regular monthly income, so we should calculate the total yearly income with and without the bonus separately.

Yearly salary without bonus = $21000 * 12 = $252000.
Yearly bonus = $10500 (since it's a one-time bonus).

Total yearly income = $252000 + $10500 = $262500."

"To find out how much candy each of them would have, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount of candy by 3, since they are sharing it equally among themselves.

Candy per person = Total amount of candy / 3
Candy per person = 12 / 3
Candy per person = 4

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days Christina had. We know that her first eight days were good, and then she had two more good days after the initial 24 days (since the next three days were good, neutral, and good). 

So, the total number of good days is 8 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 10. However, we are given that Christina had 12 good days in total. 

Since we already accounted for 10 good days, the remaining good days are 12 (total good days) - 10 (good days accounted for) = 2.

However, we also know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days after the first 24 days included 2 good days. So the 2 good days left must be in the last 6 days of the first 24 days. 

So the good days left in the month are 12 (total good days) - 10 (good days in the first 24 days and the next 3 days) = 2."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 
2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
2x / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the current height from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Now, we know the current height is 240 inches, and we want to find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches. The bamboo grows 30 inches per day.

Let's set up an equation to solve for the number of days (x):
240 + 30x = 600

Subtract 240 from both sides:
30x = 360

Divide both sides by 30:
x = 360 / 30
x = 12

"To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to calculate the number of dogs he has to provide toys for. 

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 8 more dogs arrived, making it 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. 

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he left with 12 dogs, twice as many more dogs would be 2 * 12 = 24. So the total number of dogs now is 12 + 24 = 36 dogs.

However, 3 dogs were gone when James came back, so the total number of dogs now is 36 - 3 = 33 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 33 toys in total.

"To find Skyler's investment, we need to first calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage by multiplying Lorie's hourly wage by 2.

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10 per hour = $20 per hour

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours per day. We can do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in two days.

Total hours worked in two days = 3 hours per day * 2 days = 6 hours
Total earnings in two days = $20 per hour * 6 hours = $120

Let's denote the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes as 'x'. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

We can set up the proportion as follows: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Now, we can cross-multiply: 
6x = 96 * 36

6x = 3456

Now, we can divide both sides by 6: 
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

So, the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is 576.

Let's start with Katarina, who has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has to find the total:
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 100% (original) + 50% (extension) = 150% of the original length. This can be expressed as 1.5x.

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total time taken, we need to calculate the weighted average of the time intervals. 

First, we convert the time taken in turtle mode to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes.

Now, we have the time taken in turtle mode as 60 minutes and in rabbit mode as 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, the weights for both modes are 0.5.

Weighted average = (weight of turtle mode * time in turtle mode) + (weight of rabbit mode * time in rabbit mode)
Weighted average = (0.5 * 60) + (0.5 * 40)
Weighted average = 30 + 20
Weighted average = 50

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we can calculate Celinda's cookies as follows:

Celinda's cookies = 2 * Greta's cookies
Celinda's cookies = 2 * 30
Celinda's cookies = 60

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding Greta's cookies and Celinda's cookies:

Total cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
Total cookies = 30 + 60
Total cookies = 90

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

Cookies left = Total cookies - 10
Cookies left = 90 - 10

"Let's denote the age of one twin as 't' and the age of one triplet as 'p'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as:

t = p + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:

2t + 3p = 44

Now, we can substitute the expression for 't' from the first equation into the second equation:

2(p + 7) + 3p = 44

Expanding the equation:

2p + 14 + 3p = 44

Combine like terms:

5p + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5p = 30

Divide by 5:

p = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation:

t = p + 7
t = 6 + 7
t = 13

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes, so 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, we can set up the equation:

$2.00 + 4x = $3.20

where x is the cost of one candy.

Subtracting $2.00 from both sides, we get:

4x = $1.20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = $0.30

So, one candy costs $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to determine how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:

Neil's savings per month = Rong's savings per month + (2/5 * Rong's savings per month)
Neil's savings per month = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings per month = 20 + 8
Neil's savings per month = 28

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = Rong's savings per month * 120
Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400

Neil's total savings = Neil's savings per month * 120
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
Neil's total savings = 3360

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.

Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and there are 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. 

We know the vaccines cost $40, and they are 40% of the total bill. We can set up the equation: 
0.4x = $40

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

The price of one orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of each color of squares together to find the total number of squares:

$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10):
$50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy, we need to calculate the cost of each set of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops and 1 free scoop). 

The cost of 2 scoops is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. Since the third scoop is free, the total cost for 3 scoops is still $3.00.

Now, let's divide Erin's budget by the cost of each set of 3 scoops: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2. This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops.

Since each set has 3 scoops, Erin can buy a total of 2 * 3 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them has left.

There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger started with 100 pieces, so after eating 56 pieces, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy started with 100 pieces, so after eating 42 pieces, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

Area to be covered = 36 * (2/3) 
Area to be covered = 36 * 2 / 3 
Area to be covered = 72 / 3 
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. To find the total number of tiles needed, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot.

Total tiles needed = 24 * 24 
Total tiles needed = 576

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5 times the number of pounds picked, which is 30. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is the cost per pound of $2.5 times the number of pounds, which is 30.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10"

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in this position is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in this position is 400 * 2 = 800.

The combined total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten by each group of friends and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
3 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza * 2/3 = 3 * 12 * 2/3 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza * ¾ = 2 * 12 * ¾ = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The total number of slices initially is 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

"To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so the dog takes 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the average time by adding the cat's time and the dog's time, then dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, we can write the equation as:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. We need to convert this to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches

Adding 4 inches to this, we get:

96 + 4 = 100 inches

Now, we can set up the equation as:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find 1/4 of 256. 
1/4 * 256 = 64.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4 of 64. 
3/4 * 64 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed.

Initially, 5000 people lined up at the polling station.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 = (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 = (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the number of people remaining after 2000 people voted between midday and 16:00.

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so we can write an equation:
F = 2D + 8
Substituting D = 15 into the equation, we get:
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

We are also given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so we can write an equation:
M = F - 4
Substituting F = 38 into the equation, we get:
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age:
Total age = D + F + M

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes candidate A received as follows:
20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. To calculate this, we need to find 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:
50% of 20 = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we can find the total number of votes received by candidates A and B:
Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes

Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes candidate C received is the difference between the total number of voters and the total number of votes received by candidates A and B:

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube and makes 3 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube and makes 7 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube and makes 8 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Alice has and then compare it to the number of books Clara has.

Let's start by using the information that Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Since Clara has 20 books, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

2x = 20

where x is the number of books Steven has.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 10

So Steven has 10 books.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. We can set up another equation to represent this relationship:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books, we can compare it to the number of books Clara has (20). To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books:

"To find the total number of bananas Gunther had, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so we need to subtract half of 48 from 48. Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24. 

48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile. 
24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas. 
49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile. 
37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first calculate the total annual electricity bill. 

The monthly electricity bill is $100. To find the annual bill, we multiply the monthly bill by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Annual electricity bill = $100 * 12 = $1200

Since Jenna has 4 roommates and they divide the bill equally, we need to divide the annual bill by 5 (Jenna and her 4 roommates).

Each roommate's annual share = $1200 / 5 = $240

"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the initial number of glasses and plates, then subtract the number of broken items.

1 dozen is equal to 12 items. 
So, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Initially, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses
48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates:
86 glasses + 42 plates = 128

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 20 large stickers left. She trades them for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of the large stickers. To find the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, she has 9 * 3 + 20 * 3 = 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons from large buttons, and she already has 60 small buttons. So, in total, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

However, the question asks for the total number of buttons, which can be large or small. We already calculated that she has 29 large buttons (9 + 20) and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of the large stickers. So, the total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons.

29 large buttons + 60 small buttons"

"To solve this problem, let's use a linear equation. Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either for or against the regulation. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The final answer is: 22"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Since the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, half of that is 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know the hiking speed (20 miles per hour) and the time spent hiking (1.5 hours). We can calculate the distance hiked by multiplying the hiking speed by the time spent hiking:

Distance hiked = Hiking speed * Time spent hiking
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Now, we know the total time spent driving and hiking (6 hours) and the time spent hiking (1.5 hours). We can find the time spent driving by subtracting the time spent hiking from the total time:

Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
Time spent driving = 6 hours - 1.5 hours
Time spent driving = 4.5 hours

We know the driving speed (50 miles per hour) and the time spent driving (4.5 hours). We can calculate the distance driven by multiplying the driving speed by the time spent driving:

Distance driven = Driving speed * Time spent driving
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Now, we can find the total distance to the vacation spot by adding the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked

Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so the number of berries Ava collects is 'b + 3'. 

The time left on the timer for Emma is 't' seconds, and for Ava, it's 't - 4' seconds since she finishes 4 seconds slower.

Now, let's calculate their scores:

w + o = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

The total distance traveled per week is 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total fuel consumption per week. Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total fuel consumption per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 
1/4 can be written as 2/8. 

Now, we can add the fractions: 
2/8 (smart TVs) + 1/8 (analog TVs) = 3/8

This means 3/8 of the total sales are either smart TVs or analog TVs. 
To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we subtract 3/8 from the total, which is 1 (or 8/8). 
8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8

Now, we know that 5/8 of the total sales are OLED TVs. 
Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can multiply 5/8 by 40 to find the number of OLED TVs sold.

Next, we calculate 3/5 of the total number of groups:
3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Since each member of these 6 groups brought 2 seashells, and there are 9 members in each group, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member:
6 groups * 9 members/group * 2 seashells/member = 108 seashells

"To find the amount of money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discount on the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. 
To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price: 
$40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the sale price from $50 to find the amount of money he will have left over: 
$50 - $30 = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we know that each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to multiply the total number of employees by the monthly salary and then multiply by the number of months:
260 employees * $4000 per month * 3 months

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so the total time for this song is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Total caroling time: 540"
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after 20 hours of work.

Billy's initial rate was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his rate $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current rate $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she should have for the goats to be 30%. 

Let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 

The number of goats will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x. 

The number of other stuffed animals remains the same, which is 14. 

So, the equation becomes: 
0.3x + 14 = x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 14

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 20

So, the total number of stuffed animals should be 20 for the goats to be 30%. 

Since she already has 14 stuffed animals, the number of goats she should buy is:
20 - 14 = 6

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance separating the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far apart the cars will be after 2 hours:
Distance separating the cars = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
Distance separating the cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance separating the cars = 20 miles

The pass rate for the third-graders is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
The pass rate for the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate for the fifth-graders is twice the fourth-graders', which is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

The total number of students who took the test is:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag.

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can find the total area Milo can cover by dividing the total number of chips by 12.

Total area = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Length = Total area / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts
Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining tea to the total tea consumed:
Total tea at the beginning = 10 quarts (remaining) + 38 quarts (consumed) = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total tea from quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

"To calculate the number of students at the end of May, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P * (2^n)

where A is the final number of students, P is the initial number of students (10 in this case), and n is the number of months.

Since we want to find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students after 5 months (January to May).

A = 10 * (2^5)
A = 10 * 32
A = 320

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the final number of students:

Additional students = A - P
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches he climbed.

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

First, let's find out how many minutes they play in total. They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have:
z = f

Given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have:
s = g

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have:
o = 2s

Given that she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have:
s = 2z

Since s = 2z and o = 2s, we can write:
o = 2(2z) = 4z

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
z + f + s + g + o = 10

Substituting the values we have:
z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 (since z = f, s = 2z, g = s, and o = 4z)
Combine like terms:
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

Total amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Total amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they each earn the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cards Becca has as B, Smendrick has as S, and PJ has as P.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
B + S + P = 341

We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can write the equation:
B = S + 12

We are also given that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write the equation:
S = 3P

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the second equation to get:
B = 3P + 12

Now, we can substitute the expressions for B and S into the first equation:
(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341

Combine like terms:
7P + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

Divide both sides by 7:
P = 47

Now that we know P, we can find S:

Next, let's calculate the time spent on makeup:
15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
Converting this to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent recording videos, writing songs, and doing makeup:
1.2 hours (videos) + 2 hours (songs) + 1.5 hours (makeup) = 4.7 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the items into the ones included in the base price and the additional items.

The base price includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the additional items:
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (included) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (included) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (included) = 10 additional pictures

The total additional items are 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost for the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the base price + the cost for the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we add this to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that they will take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway. So, the time it would take one turtle to cross the highway is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it would take them to cross the highway is the same as the time it would take one turtle, which is 108 hours.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each of them made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total = 20 + 40 + 80
Total = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving money from her part-time job and her mom.

The price of the laptop after trading in her old one is $600 - $200 = $400.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she received from her part-time job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the slices from the large and small apples separately and then add them together.

The large apples can be sliced into 5 pieces each, and Adam sliced 3 large apples. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

The small apples can be sliced into 3 pieces each, and Adam sliced 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find the number of slices left, we subtract 15 from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to determine how many liters of milk he currently produces. Since he has 3 cows and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the total milk production is:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the milk production per cow to find out how many more cows are needed:

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left, and the third has 1/2 left. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6, 3, and 2 is 6. 

We can rewrite the fractions as follows:
1/6 = 1/6
2/3 = 4/6
1/2 = 3/6

Now we can add the fractions:
1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6

Since 8/6 can be simplified to 4/3, we can convert it to a mixed number: 1 1/3.

Now, we know that the total length of the glue sticks used is 1 1/3 of the original length of one glue stick. Since a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, we can multiply 1 1/3 by 12 to find the total length of the glue sticks used:
1 1/3 * 12 = 16 millimeters

Since the total length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters, we can subtract the total length of the glue sticks used from the total length to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:
36 - 16 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 's' and the number of dishes Jack has as 'd'. 

Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store, we can write an equation:
d = 2s

We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so:
d = 60

Substituting d = 60 into the equation d = 2s, we get:
60 = 2s
s = 60 / 2
s = 30

So Jack has 30 socks.

Now, we are given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so:
Peter's socks = 2 * Jack's socks
Peter's socks = 2 * 30
Peter's socks = 60

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so:
Peter's dishes = (1/2) * Jack's dishes
Peter's dishes = (1/2) * 60
Peter's dishes = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks
Total socks = 30 + 60
Total socks = 90

Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes
Total dishes = 60 + 30
Total dishes = 90

Total number of socks and dishes = Total socks + Total dishes
Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90
Total number of socks and dishes = 180

We know that 5 students are good at math only. The rest of the students who are good at both subjects can be found by subtracting the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform (including getting on and off the stage).

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time taken by each group to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the question states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build double the amount they have built so far, not double the amount they have built in the first two years and then add it to the first two years. So, the correct calculation for the third year is 2 * 48 = 96, but this is the total amount they will have built, not the amount they will build in the third year. The amount they will build in the third year is 96 - 48 = 48.

3. Mom's age = 3B - 1
4. B + S + Y + (3B - 1) = 87 (When you add all your ages, you get 87)

We can simplify equation 4 by combining like terms:

4B + S + Y = 88

Now, we can substitute Y from equations 1 and 2 into the simplified equation 4:
4B + (Y - 2) + Y = 88 (Substituting S from equation 2)
4B + (B - 3 - 2) + (B - 3) = 88 (Substituting Y from equation 1)

"To model this exponential growth, we can use the formula for discrete exponential growth:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

- N(t) is the number of infected people at time t
- N0 is the initial number of infected people (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate per time step (6 new infections per infected person, so 6)
- t is the number of time steps (days in this case)

However, since each infected person infects 6 others, the growth rate is actually 6 times the number of infected people, not 6 times 1. So, the correct formula for this problem is:

2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve the system of equations. 

First, we can rewrite equation (2) as S - A = 25. Then, we can rewrite equation (3) as A = F - 12.

Now, we can substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to get S - (F - 12) = 25. Simplifying this, we get S - F + 12 = 25, or S = F + 13.

Now, we can substitute S = F + 13 and A = F - 12 into the first equation (S + A + F = 85):

(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine like terms:

"To find the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find the number of pieces remaining after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces he ate each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of each.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit Sarah makes from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and we need to find out how many meters of rope Sarah can buy with the $40 she has. To do this, we can divide the amount of money she has by the cost per meter:
$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters

Since we can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll round down to 26 meters. The cost of the new rope will be:
26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit Sarah made:
$40 - $39 = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can set up the equation:

Melanie's current age + 10 = 18

Let's denote Melanie's current age as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:

x + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. Then, the equation becomes:

8 + y = 3(8)

Expanding the equation:

8 + y = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

y = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 
5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

The total cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The price of a pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, so the price of a pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
The total cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:
$65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 15 from both sides:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster:

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since we don't know the amount she was paid for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, let's denote the amount she was paid for mowing one lawn as 'y'. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amount she made from mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, Kamala's lawn '3x' times, and Alba's lawn '5x' times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is xy + 3xy + 5xy = 9xy.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so xy = 6.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then work backwards.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 1 dozen (12) balloons will cost 12 / 2 * 0.5 = 3 dollars.

The total amount spent on the cake and balloons is 11 + 3 = 14 dollars.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for 7 dollars each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * 7 = 14 dollars.

The total amount spent is 14 (cake and balloons) + 14 (ice cream) = 28 dollars.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy the gifts, the total amount they had is 28 dollars. To find out how much each of them received, we need to divide the total amount by 2.

28 / 2 = 14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them 14 dollars."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) = 8
8 + 6 (oranges) = 14

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to find the total revenue and the total cost. 

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet to find the total number of pets Larry has:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. 

The total number of slices they can eat in a day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat in a day (6).

"To find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. So, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months:
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected is equal to the number of months:
60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15
Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15 = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the remaining cups by 2 (for chamomile and mint) and then by 3 (for the number of rows).

Cups of chamomile and mint tea = 12
Equal cups of chamomile and mint tea = 12 / 2 = 6
Cups of mint tea in each row = 6 / 3 = 2

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the least number of berries per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate it as follows:

Initial amount of water in the pool = 10000 gallons
Initial amount of water in the tank = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Now, we need to find the amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so:

Total amount of water emptied in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:

Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount of water in the tank - Total amount of water emptied
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $150 his parents gave him.

Colby saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10. So, the total cost for the night will be $10 + $10 = $20.

Since Colby has exactly $20 left, he can see 1 more movie."
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked. The total calories are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference.

Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
= 300 miles - 240 miles

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write the equation:

P + L + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write the equation:

L = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write the equation:

P = L + J

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:

P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 90

Now, substitute the third equation into this equation:

(L + J) + 2J = 90

Substitute L = J + 10 into this equation:

(J + 10 + J) + 2J = 90

Combine like terms:

4J + 10 = 90

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's ages, we can find Peter's age:

P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets per day.
In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets per month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets per day.
In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets per month.

Now, let's calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6 per widget = $259200 per month
WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6 per widget = $194400 per month

The total cost of the CDs without the discount is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

With a 40% discount, James saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, which is $8 per CD. 

The total cost of the 5 CDs he sold is 5 CDs * $15 per CD = $75. He sold them for $40, so he lost $75 - $40 = $35 on those CDs.

However, since he initially paid $90 for all 10 CDs, and the 5 he sold cost $75, the 5 he kept cost $90 - $75 = $15. He didn't lose any money on the 5 he kept.

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, we need to find the distance James swam initially. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can find the initial swimming time using the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to find the resting time. Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, we can calculate the resting time as follows:

Resting Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the remaining distance James needs to swim. Since he swam 12 miles initially, the remaining distance is:

Remaining Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed for the remaining distance, his new rate is:

New Rate = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can find the final swimming time using the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to get across the lake by adding the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time:

Total Time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so we can write the equation:
B = A + 20

We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can write the equation:
B = D + 10

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to get:

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider that each paper has two pages (one on each side). 

First, we calculate the total number of papers in the book. Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages (or 50 papers, since each paper has 2 pages) per inch, we multiply 1.5 inches by 100 pages per inch to get the total number of pages, then divide by 2 to get the number of papers, then multiply by 2 to get the total number of pages.

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages, then 150 pages / 2 = 75 papers, then 75 papers * 2 pages/paper = 150 pages.

Alternatively, we can simply multiply 1.5 inches by 100 pages/inch and then multiply by 2 (since each paper has 2 pages), but to avoid confusion, we can multiply 1.5 inches by 200 pages/inch.

1.5 inches * 200 pages/inch = 300 pages.

First, let's convert the time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM to minutes. 
8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours, which is 11 * 60 = 660 minutes.
Total time spent stapling reports is 240 + 660 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, his rate is 30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
1/5 of 1000 is (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds occupied.
So, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

Now, the total number of occupied beds is 200 (initial) + 700 (new patients) = 900 beds.
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails are 9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to first find Shawna's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract that from the number she reported.

First, let's calculate 20% of 48:
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, let's subtract 9.6 from the number Courtney reported:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

The actual number of people who attended the concert is 38."
"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried. 

We know Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

We also know Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we can find the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried: 
Total number of balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total number of balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total number of balls = 7

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we can find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to determine how many Collins received and then add the amounts received by all three.

We know Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Collins received 15 more than Amora and Lainey, so Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amounts received by all three:
Total corn chips = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and D, respectively.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + D = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
A = S + 5

We are also given that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:
S = 4D - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into the first equation:
(S + 5) + S + D = 339

Combine like terms:
2S + D + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
2S + D = 334

Now substitute the expression for S from the third equation into this equation:
2(4D - 13) + D = 334

Expand and simplify:
8D - 26 + D = 334

Combine like terms:
9D - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9D = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
D = 40

Now that we know D, we can find S by substituting D into the third equation:
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to first find the total number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can divide the number of minutes per episode by 2.

Number of minutes per episode = 20
Number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, we can multiply the number of episodes by the number of minutes per episode to find the total number of minutes.

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Number of minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north in this segment, the distance traveled is subtracted from the total distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the southward segments and subtract the distance traveled in the northward segment to find the net distance:
Net Distance = Distance (south) - Distance (north) + Distance (south)
Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles
Net Distance = 374 miles

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To calculate her age, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average of the time it takes to string each type of racquet and then multiply it by the total number of racquets.

First, let's calculate the total time for each type of string:
- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for all the racquets: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Since we want to find the average time per racquet, we can divide the total time by the total number of racquets: 227 minutes / 12 racquets = 18.92 minutes per racquet.

However, the question asks for the total time to string all the racquets, so we don't need to divide by the number of racquets. The total time is the sum of the time for each type of string.

Total time: 227 minutes"

The cost of the remaining phone is $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, we add the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the remaining phone to get the total cost.

Total cost = $1200 + $300 = $1500.

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine the total number of oranges she had initially and then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she had initially is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away:
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:
1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges

So, she sold the rest of the oranges, which is:

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the costs of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 
Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 
Total cost = $39 

Now, we subtract the amount Tyler has saved from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 
Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved 
Amount needed = $39 - $14 
Amount needed = $25 

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 
Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage 
Hours needed = $25 / $5 
Hours needed = 5

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Since he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

Now, let's summarize the sales for both days:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread, 11 boxes of apple pie

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Since Emil will be 24, his dad will be D + 5 (5 years from now). We can set up the equation:

24 = (1/2)(D + 5)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2:

48 = D + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

43 = D

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 - 5 = 38 years old.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be B + 5 (5 years from now). We can set up the equation:

24 = 2(B + 5)

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:

12 = B + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

Now, we need to find the total space each plant will occupy, including the space between plants. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. 

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant occupies.

Flights to Greece = (3/4) * Total flights of the first plane
Flights to Greece = (3/4) * 88
Flights to Greece = 66

Now, we can calculate the remaining flights:
Remaining flights = Total flights of the first plane - Flights to Greece
Remaining flights = 88 - 66
Remaining flights = 22

Since the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, we can calculate the number of flights to France:
Flights to France = Remaining flights / 2
Flights to France = 22 / 2
Flights to France = 11

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12. 

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, let's subtract the total amount of money Adam received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
H + W = 13

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20/4 = 5.

Helene's age = 2 * average age
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute H = 10 into the equation H + W = 13:
10 + W = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

First, we add the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund: 
$500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) = $2000

Then, we add the $200 given by Walter's friend: 
$2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we multiply the total amount collected by 3: 
$2200 * 3 = $6600

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 2.

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

The fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is 2x / 8x = 1/4.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on tasks and subtract it from the total time he has at the clinic.

Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours = 9 * 60 minutes = 540 minutes

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent on tasks: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Time left to update records: 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time left to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract that from the target serving time.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since the target serving time is 5:00 pm, we need to convert this to minutes. Assuming a 12-hour clock, 5:00 pm is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes past 12:00 pm (noon).

Now, we subtract the total time required from the target serving time:
300 minutes (5:00 pm) - 180 minutes (total time required) = 120 minutes

Converting 120 minutes back to hours and minutes, we get:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Since we're working with a 12-hour clock, we subtract 2 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 2 hours = 3:00 pm

However, we need to consider that the 2 hours is the time before 5:00 pm, so we should subtract 2 hours from 5:00 pm, but also consider the 12-hour clock, so we subtract 2 hours from 5:00 pm, which is 3:00 pm.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to know the total cost and the revenue. However, the question does not provide the revenue per session. Let's assume the revenue per student per session is 'x'. 

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40.

The total cost per week is $40 * 3 (days) = $120.

The total cost per month (assuming 4 weeks) is $120 * 4 = $480.

The total revenue per session is 10 * x (students) = 10x.

The total revenue per week is 10x * 3 (days) = 30x.

The total revenue per month (assuming 4 weeks) is 30x * 4 = 120x.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total revenue minus the total cost: 120x - 480.

Since we do not know the value of 'x', we cannot provide a numerical answer."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Let's start with Peter. He has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we divide 64 by 4:

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. She has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we divide 56 by 7:

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

16 - 8 = 8

30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Volume = L * W * H
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed:
1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Blue sticks = 14

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
Yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3
Yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
Total sticks = Red sticks + Blue sticks + Yellow sticks
Total sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total sticks = 34

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards.

Let's start with the last information given: after 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour, the charge remaining was 28%. 

Since the power bank lost 7% each hour for 3 hours, the total percentage lost in those 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. 

So, before those 3 hours, the charge was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, let's go back to the 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. The total percentage lost in those 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%.

So, before those 5 hours, the charge was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4x, and the total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12y. The total earnings from both is $120.

We can set up the equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute x in the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

This simplifies to 8y + 12y = 120, which further simplifies to 20y = 120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get y = 6.

So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's add the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 0.76.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.76 = 0.24.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of seats available for friends and family. 

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the seats allocated for graduates, which is 950.

Seats for friends and family per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first determine how many medium-sized beans he can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3. 

Number of small beans = 3 * 150 = 450

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

First, we need to find the total number of bottles. Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 more bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both components separately.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked instead of attending college. Since he had a $25,000 per year job before college, the total lost income is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To calculate the number of years it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

The area of one piece of fabric is:
Area = Length * Width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
Total Area = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. 
Total amount lost = $5 (lost in the first race) + $16.50 (lost in the third race) - $11 (won in the second race) 
Total amount lost = $5 + $16.50 - $11 
Total amount lost = $10.50

Xavier's growth = 3 inches
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's height = 50 inches
Cole's growth = 2 inches
Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first person, the share of the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the share of the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8: 21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 0.375 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days worked to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of linear equations. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first set as x, the second set as y, and the third set as z.

We know that in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. This can be expressed as:
x = y + 4

We also know that in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. This can be expressed as:
z = 0.5y

We are also given that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. This can be expressed as:
x + y + z = 19

Now, we can substitute the expressions for x and z from the first two equations into the third equation:
(y + 4) + y + 0.5y = 19

Combine like terms:
2.5y + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:
2.5y = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:
y = 6

Now that we know y, we can find x:
x = y + 4
x = 6 + 4
x = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Depreciation for the first year (2007-2008) = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Depreciation for the second year (2008-2009) = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Depreciation for the third year (2009-2010) = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22

For the twin beds, he needs 4 sets of sheets, but can only wash 2 sets at a time. So, he needs 2 loads for the twin beds (4 sets / 2 sets per load = 2 loads).

For the king size bed, he needs 1 set of sheets, and can wash 1 set at a time. So, he needs 1 load for the king size bed.

In total, Greg does 2 loads for the twin beds and 1 load for the king size bed per week, which is 3 loads per week.

B = D + 18

We also know that the total time it took to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of the time it took Betsy and Donovan to complete their parts. So, we can write another equation:

B + D = 98

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Combine like terms:

2D + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2D = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find the total number of guests, we need to add the number of classmates, dance class members, and family members, then subtract the number of people who cannot come.

Number of classmates: 25
Number of dance class members: 7
Number of family members: 13
Total number of guests initially invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
Number of people who cannot come: 4
Total number of guests attending: 45 - 4 = 41

Since the party is for 20 people initially, we need to find the number of additional guests.
Number of additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest.
Cost for additional guests: 21 * 6 = 126

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests.
Total cost: 125 + 126 = 251

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount they spent and subtract it from their initial amount.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * 60 = 15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:
Maggie has 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.
Riza has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.

The total amount of money they have left is 45 + 40 = 85 dollars.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

45 bananas - 24 bananas = 21 bananas

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and the change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- 12 roses cost $15
- 3 additional roses cost 3 * $2 = $6
Total cost = $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
$25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:
$4 * 4 quarters/dollar = 16 quarters

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. It will leave the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.
200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

We know that Binkie's score is 90, so B = 90. 

The problem states that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. This can be represented as an equation:

F = 2B + 15

Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into three parts: 

1. Walking halfway to the store (2 miles)
2. Walking back home (2 miles)
3. Walking the full distance to the store (4 miles)

Time taken to walk halfway to the store = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours
Time taken to walk back home = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours
Time taken to walk the full distance to the store = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

Total time taken = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 1 hour = 2 hours

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the two amounts.

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.

Now, let's subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually to find the amount of money Jenny saved: $32 - $30 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'S' and the amount Harry gets as 'H'. We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

S + H = 100

We also know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write the equation:

H = S + 60

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

S + (S + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2S + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2S = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of minutes John spends learning in a week, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class. 

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. 
Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. 
He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. 
He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each day. 
Since he spends 1600 minutes per week in class, he spends (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes on each Saturday and Sunday. 
So, the total extra learning time is 100 * 2 = 200 minutes per week.

Now, let's add the class time and extra learning time to get the total minutes per week. 
Total minutes per week = 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total minutes per week to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 
Total hours per week = 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 + 2 = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 - 5 = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 + 3 = 72 inches

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the Allosaurus ate the other half. So, the total weight of the triceratops left after the velociraptors scavenged is 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Since the velociraptors and the Allosaurus together ate 540 kilograms, which is half of what was left, the T-Rex must have left 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Finally, we know the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the original weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%). 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, we subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her desired retirement savings and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = 0.4 x $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her desired annual retirement income for 20 years. A common rule of thumb is to use the 4% withdrawal rule, which assumes that Lauren can safely withdraw 4% of her retirement savings each year to cover her living expenses.

To calculate the total retirement savings needed, we can divide the desired annual retirement income by the withdrawal rate (4% or 0.04):

Total retirement savings needed = Desired annual retirement income / Withdrawal rate
Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 / 0.04
Total retirement savings needed = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren has already saved. Since we don't know how many years she has been working, we'll assume she starts from scratch. However, we do know that she saves 20% of her annual salary.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
Annual savings = 0.2 x $100,000
Annual savings = $20,000

To calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings
Number of years to reach goal = $1,000,000 / $20,000
Number of years to reach goal = 50 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, we can subtract the number of years she has already worked (which we don't know) from the total number of years it will take her to reach her goal. However, since we don't have that information, we'll assume she starts from scratch and provide the number of years she needs to work from now.

Number of years Lauren needs to work from now = Number of years to reach goal - Number of years already worked (unknown)
Since we don't know the number of years already worked, we'll provide the number of years to reach the goal.

Number of years Lauren needs to work from now = 50 years - x (unknown)
However, we can say that if she has been working for some years, she will need to work for fewer than 50 years.

However, if she has just started working, she will need to work for 50 years."

Now, we can solve for the total number of students by dividing both sides by 0.4:
total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Since the total number of students is 600 and 240 are boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of women.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has available for hiking in June. Since June has 30 days, we will use that as the total number of days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. 

If she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily mileage is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out her required daily mileage, we divide the total miles by the total days: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since Soledad's current daily mileage is 250 miles, we subtract this from the required daily mileage to find the additional miles she needs to hike per day: 310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will give to Peter and Paul.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 12 * 0.33 = 4 kg.

The total amount given to Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the question asks about James, but the initial buyers were Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, we assume James is one of them. If we consider James as one of the initial buyers, then the amount left is the total amount minus the amount given to Peter and Paul.

The amount left is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

However, if James is not one of the initial buyers, then the question doesn't make sense, as James wouldn't have any apples to begin with.

Assuming James is one of the initial buyers, the answer is:

Let's denote the unknown time as 'x'. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, the proportion can be set up as follows:

255 / 5 = 459 / x

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

255x = 459 * 5
255x = 2295

Now, divide both sides by 255:

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought.

Initial male fishes: 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Initial female fishes: 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Tate bought: 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4 male fishes
Tate bought: 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4 female fishes

Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

First, let's find the distance of a one-way trip. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Round trip distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

"To find the rate of the fifth worker, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional time worked by the other workers must produce 400 - 200 = 200 toys. However, the problem states that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 200 - 20 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the rate of the fifth worker, we divide the number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so Elijah's second dog weighs 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to get the total weight: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Speed of fastest car = 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first determine his age two years ago. 

Let's denote Liam's current age as L and Vince's age two years ago as V. We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

We are given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This can be expressed as an equation:

L - 2 = 2(V)

Substituting L = 16, we get:

14 = 2V

Now, we can solve for V by dividing both sides by 2:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, let's consider Camden and Sarah. We know they painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. We also know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted:
Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13 = 8

200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes

To find the total weight of the boxes, we need to multiply the number of boxes by their weight.
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to add their weights.
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we need to divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound).

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time she spends walking on the beach.

Let's denote the rate at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'r' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her rate on the sidewalk is '2r' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate. 

So, 40 = 2 / r. 
r = 2 / 40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a rate of 2r = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute. 

Time taken to walk on the sidewalk = distance / rate = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

Total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk = time on the beach + time on the sidewalk = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we first need to find the number of sunflowers and bouquets sold per day.

Let's start with the bouquets. Each bouquet costs $8, and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day. We can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of one bouquet:

Number of bouquets per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of one bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is:

Number of sunflowers in bouquets per day = Number of bouquets per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers
= 84 sunflowers per day

Now, let's find the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Each sunflower costs $2, and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day. We can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of one sunflower:

Number of sunflowers per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of one sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13 sunflowers per day

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold in bouquets and the individual sunflowers:

Total sunflowers per day = Number of sunflowers in bouquets per day + Number of sunflowers per day
= 84 + 13
= 97 sunflowers per day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

"To calculate the total amount Jen spends on food in May, we need to first determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Since Jen has 3 fish and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the daily cost of food is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since it's three times more likely to win than the first ticket, which has a 20% chance of winning, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, since the two events are independent, we can find the combined probability of both tickets winning by multiplying their individual probabilities:

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Combined probability = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Combined probability = 0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected initially. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. 
Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 
Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation:
2x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides:
2x = 22

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 11

So Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:
11 + 22 + 27 = 60

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
60 / 3 = 20

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, let's add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. 
The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 
To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
Length of the second song = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of the two songs:

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120.

The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required for one person. 

Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed for one person as follows:
100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

Now, we can calculate the number of bottles needed for 2300 people:
5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to calculate the probability of a baby wearing a bow and purple given the total number of babies wearing bows.

There are 8 babies in total. 
3/4 of them wear purple, so the number of babies wearing purple is 8 * 3/4 = 6.
1/4 of them wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 8 * 1/4 = 2.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (6 * 1/3 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The number of babies wearing purple and a bow is 2. 
The probability of a baby wearing a bow and purple is the number of babies wearing purple and a bow divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We know a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 (for the first 6 years and the last year, since we don't have the exact production for the other years, but we can calculate the total for 10 years by adding the rest of the years) 
We still need the production for years 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. Since the pattern of production is not explicitly stated for the first 4 years, we can assume the pattern starts from the 5th year. However, we can still calculate the total production for 10 years by using the information given.

The total production for the years we have information for is 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350. 
We also know that the 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, and the 6-year-old tree produces 3 times that amount. If we assume the pattern of increasing production by a factor of the age (but starting from the 5th year), we can calculate the production for the first 4 years as follows:
- Year 1: 1 * initial amount (but we don't know the initial amount for year 1, so let's call it x), however, we can use the 5-year-old tree's production to establish a pattern. 
- Year 2: 2 * x (but we still don't know x, however, we can use the 5-year-old tree's production to establish a pattern).
- Year 3: 3 * x (but we still don't know x, however, we can use the 5-year-old tree's production to establish a pattern).
- Year 4: 4 * x (but we still don't know x, however, we can use the 5-year-old tree's production to establish a pattern).
- Year 5: 5 * x = 50 (now we can solve for x, x = 10).

Now that we know x, we can calculate the production for the first 4 years:
- Year 1: 1 * 10 = 10
- Year 2: 2 * 10 = 20
- Year 3: 3 * 10 = 30
- Year 4: 4 * 10 = 40

Now we can add the production for the first 4 years to the total production for the years we had information for:
10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 2350 = 2450

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the blue rope is x. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4x. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope by multiplying x by 4:

Length of red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides to get:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5, we get:

x = $3

So, they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The remaining half of the mural (6 pints) is divided equally among red, white, and purple. To find the amount of each color, we divide 6 pints by 3.

6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to find the sum of a geometric sequence. 

The first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2, since the number of clouds doubles each day. The number of terms (n) is 5, representing the days from Monday to Friday.

The sequence will be: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence: 

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted is 93."
"To find the number of pods in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find the cost per pod by dividing the cost by the number of pods: 
$12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can find the number of cycles we can run for $1 by dividing $1 by the cost per pod: 
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he has is:
$1000 / $20 = 50

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of 20 dollar bills remaining is:
50 - 10 = 40

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
40 / 2 = 20

So, he uses 20 bills and is left with:
40 - 20 = 20

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is:
20 * $20 = $400

Thomas then triples his money, so the new amount is:
$400 * 3 = $1200

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday, leaving 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk. 
20% of the original 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 1 inch per day. 
However, the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches. 
So we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk is not needed, we just need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 1 inch per day, but the chalk will be recycled when it is 2 inches, so we will use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 and add 2 to the result of the division of 0.75 by 1 inch per day.

0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we will round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case we will round down to 0 days and add 2 to the result of the division of 2.75 by 1 inch per day.

2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days, but since we can't have a fraction of a day, we will round down to the nearest whole number.

2.75 days is rounded down to 2 days, but we will add 1 day to the result because the teacher will use the chalk for 2 days and on the third day the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches.

2 + 1 = 3 days, but the teacher already used the chalk for 1 day, so we will add 1 day to the result.

3 + 1 = 4 days, but the teacher will use the chalk for 3 days and on the fourth day the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches, so the teacher will use the chalk for 3 days.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to find out the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then determine the amount of milk that was returned.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon:
4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was returned, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount:
2/5 * $14,000 = (2 * $14,000) / 5
= $28,000 / 5
= $5,600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500. 

$27000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the number of books per set to find the total number of books.

54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can assume that 20 years have passed since it came out.

When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's denote Jim's age at that time as x. Then John's age at that time would be 2x.

Since John is 28 now, we can set up an equation to find their age difference:

John's current age = John's age 20 years ago + 20
28 = 2x + 20

Subtract 20 from both sides:
8 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:
4 = x

So Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at that time:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, the net gain of bandages on the third day is 100 - 25 = 75.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that before ordering the two bulk packs on the third day, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

So, at the end of the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38. This means that before ordering the bulk pack on the first day, they had 31 - 50 + 38 = 19 bandages.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac by adding 50% of the cost per bottle of scotch to the cost per bottle of scotch.
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% * Cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)

"To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debt, we need to calculate the amount of the loan and then the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate 40% of the value of his house to find the loan amount:
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Then, we calculate 60% of the loan amount to find out how much he used to pay off his debts:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount to find out how much he has leftover:

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * Cost price
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed at the low setting is:
1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is:
2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed at the high setting is:
4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting to find the overall total:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the principal amount ($300). 
Interest = Principal * Rate
Interest = $300 * 0.02
Interest = $6

The total amount Stephen owes is the principal plus the interest.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $300 + $6
Total Amount = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.
Total Paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
Total Paid in 11 months = $275

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount minus the total paid in 11 months.

"To find the volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs. 

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pounds of meat needed for 80 meatballs:

16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

16x = 80
x = 80 / 16
x = 5

So, Aiden will need 5 pounds of ground beef to make 80 meatballs.

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:
c + (3c - 2) = 10

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

Number of flashlights for rooms = 8 * 2 = 16
Total number of flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 
Half the rooms = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20
Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights.
Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 + 20 = 56

"To find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To find the total number of items, we need to determine the number of robots and footballs. 

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. 
Number of footballs = 2 * Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work and then divide that by the time it takes to deal with a call.

First, let's convert the hours Tim spends at work each day to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends at work in a week is:
360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, let's divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call:
1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

The total distance is 200 yards, with half of it (100 yards) on land and the other half (100 yards) in water.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 * 450 = 4500 words

On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for these 4 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the number of kernels popped in each interval:

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the number of lemons required for the regular gallons of lemonade and then the number of lemons required for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.

For the regular gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed for the regular gallons is:
4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon is:
2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

The total number of lemons needed is the sum of the lemons needed for the regular gallons and the extra gallon:

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and it's 40% off. To calculate the discount, we need to find 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The discount is $16, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total allowance and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan's allowance for 3 weeks is $6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of ice cream cones for Ryan and his 3 friends is $1.25 * 4 = $5.

Now, subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

The cost of movie tickets for Ryan and his 3 friends is $6.50 * 4 = $26. However, Ryan only has $13. Since he can't afford tickets for all of them, we need to find out how many tickets he can buy with the money he has.

To do this, we divide the amount of money Ryan has by the cost of a single ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"

"To calculate the profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for 1 jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44/jar * 10 jars = $440

The total revenue from selling 10 jars:
$50/jar * 10 jars = $500

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440
Profit = $60

The value of the quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of the dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of the nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of the pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works in 2 weeks and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so for 30 cars, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the changes in the number of cookies of each flavor.

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has a total of 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of the collection and then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy. So, the amount he would get from the first half is 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy. So, the amount he would get from the other half is 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, Nate fills in 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes per day. So, the net number of holes filled per day is:

9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: T = 16/2 = 8
2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: T = P + 2
   Since we already know T = 8, we can find P: 8 = P + 2, P = 6
3. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: T + B + P = 29
   Substituting the values of T and P, we get: 8 + B + 6 = 29

Now, we can solve for B:
8 + B + 6 = 29
B + 14 = 29
B = 29 - 14
B = 15

However, we know that Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor lost some beakers. So, the number of beakers Igor lost is the difference between the number of beakers he had and the number of beakers requested:
Number of beakers lost = 15 - 7 = 8

Number of beakers lost: 8"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

Now, let's subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws James has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Now, we can use the relationship A = 2V to find Vanessa's speed. Since A = 1/8 miles per minute, V = A/2 = (1/8)/2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute. To find the time it took her to complete her part, we can divide the distance by her speed: 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total cost price of the watermelons and then the total selling price.

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80.

The profit percentage is 25%, so the selling price will be 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

Total selling price = Total cost price * (1 + Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 * (1 + 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 * 1.25
Total selling price = $100

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age and then add 3 years.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We know that John had James when he was 19 years old. This means the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. The age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 years.

Since the age difference between John and James is 19 years, and the age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 years, the age difference between James and his youngest brother is 32 - 19 = 13 years.

Given that James is 18 years old, his youngest brother's current age is 18 - 13 = 5 years.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 30 / 2
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.
