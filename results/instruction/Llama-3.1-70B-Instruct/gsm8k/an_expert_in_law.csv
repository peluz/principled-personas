"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's subtract the total eggs used from the total eggs laid:
Total eggs laid: 16
Total eggs used: 7
Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janet makes by selling the eggs:
Eggs left to sell: 9
Price per egg: $2
Total amount made: 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Total bolts required = blue fiber + white fiber = 2 + 1 = 3

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After the repairs, the value increased by 150%. To calculate the new value, we need to find 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is $80,000 (original price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. 

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. So, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 9 = 180 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

The answer is: 140"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of every second glass. 

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into pairs of two. There will be 8 pairs of glasses. 

For each pair, the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. 

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To determine the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes her to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The total time it takes her to download the entire 200 GB file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla already spent 40 minutes downloading 80 GB before the restart, and she also spent 20 minutes on the restart itself. Since she has to restart the download from the beginning, the 40 minutes she spent before the restart are wasted. Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is 100 minutes (to download the entire file) + 20 minutes (for the restart) = 120 minutes.

The answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he initially drove away from home.

Distance driven away from home = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered during the 4 hours while trying to get home:
- The first 2 hours were spent in standstill traffic, so the distance covered is 0 miles.
- The next half-hour (0.5 hours) was spent driving at 30 mph, so the distance covered is 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- The remaining time is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, spent driving at 80 mph, so the distance covered is 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Total distance covered during the 4 hours = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Now, subtract the distance covered from the initial distance driven away from home:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.50 * 3 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.50 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.50 * 5 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.50 * 6 = $63
Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.50 * 7 = $73.50
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.50 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.50 * 9 = $94.50
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.50 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.50 * 11 = $115.50
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.50 * 12 = $126
Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.50 * 13 = $136.50

It will take 13 years for the total revenue to exceed the total cost.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

She then had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, the equation becomes:

2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and add it to the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances covered on both days.

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to determine the total time she has available to complete the hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. To complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa will need 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) and taken 2 hours to do so. This means she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To cover this distance in 1 hour, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:
Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at the time of his son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). The amount he paid is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price.

We can set up the equation as follows: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream per night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings. 

Since each carton contains 15 servings, we can divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton to find the total number of cartons: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons.

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write:

g = s + 30

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so the sum of gold and silver coins is:

g + s = 110

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling the Lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x = $165 / $15 to find the number of sets he sold.

$165 / $15 = 11.

So, he sold 11 sets. To find the number of sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he had.

13 (initial sets) - 11 (sets sold) = 2.

He runs 3 days a week. The first day, he runs 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time

Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Given that she travels for six hours, we can calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours
Time spent running = 2 hours

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours
Time spent walking = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled while running and walking as follows:

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Finally, we can calculate the total distance traveled by adding the distance traveled while running and walking:

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the total distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, multiply the weight per serving by 0.8.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total Revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:

Total Cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total Cost = 2 * $10.00
Total Cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net Profit = $20.00

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written in the three days: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties as follows:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Given that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost per red tie as follows:
Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties as follows:
Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then determine the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Number of occupied units = Total units * (3/4)
= 120 units * (3/4)
= 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Number of unoccupied units = Total units - Number of occupied units
= 120 units - 90 units
= 30 units

"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then find out how much he makes from selling those eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens, as Lloyd sells them by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs

Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs * $2/dozen = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the time it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 mph. 
Time = Distance / Speed.
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds. 

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. 
4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 500 pounds, so Alex's weight is 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we need to find their combined weights. 
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to calculate the total number of roses first and then multiply that by the number of thorns per rose.

Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is:
3 (rose bushes) * 25 (roses per bush) = 75 roses

Each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
75 (roses) * 8 (thorns per rose) = 600 thorns

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations, which is 44.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to determine her monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

Since Sylvie has been with the company for five years, she is eligible for the 10% increase. The increase amount is 10% of her initial monthly salary of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. 

Her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660. 

Since this increase happens every year, after three years, Sylvie will receive three 10% increases. 

Year 1: $660 (initial increase) 
Year 2: $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726 
Year 3: $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60 

To calculate her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12. 
Annual salary = $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the number of gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Expected attendees = Total invited guests - (1/4 * Total invited guests)
Expected attendees = 16 - (1/4 * 16)
Expected attendees = 16 - 4
Expected attendees = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Expected attendees * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
Total cost = 9 * 2
Total cost = 18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults will eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to establish the age of Corey first. Since James is 1 year younger than Corey and James is 10 years old, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

Given that there are two cats for every dog and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we find the number of girls in the girl scout:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * Number of girls
= 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces).

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of canned tomatoes by the ounces per can to find the number of cans used: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes used: 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 (total number of cars that drove through) - 20 (cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes) = 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of pages Solo has to read is 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, the remaining number of pages he has to read is 39 - 15 = 24 pages.

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining number of pages by the number of days: 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.

"To determine the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends, but since he only has water with 3 meals and before bed on both days, and only has soda with dinner on one of the weekend days, we subtract 1 from the weekend total to account for the soda, making it 7 - 1 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week: 20 + 6 = 26.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are there in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 sections

Since the fog bank covers 1 section in 10 minutes, it will cover 14 sections in 14 * 10 minutes.

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

After Poppy places her pieces, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 1/3 * 750 = 250 pieces.

Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time he spent watching TV.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry had 110 cookies. So before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he meant to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation to find the number of cookies he baked last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon. Since the person is buying 10 gallons, the total cashback reward is:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then find out how much water the boat took on for that distance.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can set up a proportion using the given time to reach the shore (64 seconds) and the time it took her to row 20 feet (16 seconds).

Distance = (64 seconds * 20 feet) / 16 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2.

Total water = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters

1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards will be $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards will be $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's initial salary, then calculate their salaries four years later.

Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as L. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's initial salary as 1.3L. We are given that Adrien's initial salary was $40000. 

So, 1.3L = 40000
L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30769.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is 1.4 times his initial salary.
Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we assume the same rate of increase for Lylah. However, the problem does not specify the rate of increase for Lylah. Assuming the same rate of increase (40%) for Lylah as for Adrien for the sake of calculation:
Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 43078 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43078
Total salary = 99078

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that number from the current total of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped (20) from the current total (30). 

30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons. We also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew. So, the total number of spoons she had when setting the table (12) includes the spoons from her husband's package (5) and the remaining spoons from her own package (after using 3).

Let's subtract the spoons from her husband's package from the total number of spoons: 12 - 5 = 7.

Since Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, we need to add those back to the remaining spoons to find out how many were in her original package: 7 + 3 = 10.

Therefore, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages he bought and add it to the number of chicken sausages.

Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages (38) to the number of fish sausages (44) to find the total number of sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he is buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of each item:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated by the hospital.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day. The total time spent by the doctors is 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent by the doctors in hours is 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, and the total time spent by the patients is also 200 hours. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Initially, Nissa hired 60 seasonal workers. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, after the first wave of quitting, the number of elves left is 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. 
The number of elves left after the second wave of quitting is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

May expenditure: $500
June expenditure: $500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to find the total.

Total expenditure = May expenditure + June expenditure

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, Pam and Fred took 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W. Since W = 4Q, W = 4(100) = 400.

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months.

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

After the first 2 months, the price will be:
$20 + $4 = $24

However, for the next 2-month interval, the price increase will be 20% of the new price ($24), not the original price ($20). 
20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80

After the second 2 months, the price will be:
$24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see a pattern emerging, where the price increase is 20% of the previous price. This is a classic example of compound interest.

To calculate the price after 18 intervals, we can use the formula for compound interest:
A = P * (1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = original price = $20
r = interest rate = 20% = 0.20
n = number of intervals = 18

However, since the interest is compounded every 2 months, we need to adjust the formula to:
A = P * (1 + r)^n
A = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20 * 7.485947397
A ≈ $149.71884794

Rounding to two decimal places, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months will be approximately $149.72.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would have earned her $35 per hour. The total lost income is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If she hires the accountant, she will pay $90.

The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is $105 - $90 = $15.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Number of eggs needed = Number of flans * Number of eggs per flan
Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9
Number of babysitting sessions = 5

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * $8 = $16.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider both his weekday and weekend walking habits.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, he walks 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, he walks 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. 
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we first need to determine the total amount she pays each month. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. The total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. 50% of $1000 is 0.5 * $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment. $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To calculate the total amount she pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly payment by 12. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Their total revenue is $25 (profit) plus their total cost. However, we don't know their total cost yet. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. 

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x.

The revenue from 'x' gallons is 20x glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10x.

Their profit is the difference between revenue and cost, which is $10x - $5x = $5x. We know their profit is $25, so $5x = $25.

Now, we can solve for 'x': x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Since they made 5 gallons, they spent $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 5:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

"To determine the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time of one runner by the number of runners. 

Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we calculate the time for each runner:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the total time of the less well-rounded team from the total time of the well-rounded team. However, since the well-rounded team is actually slower, we subtract the well-rounded team's time from the less well-rounded team's time.

Difference in time = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

However, the question asks for how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the less well-rounded team is actually slower, we need to find the difference in the other direction.

The faster team (less well-rounded team is not the faster team) is the well-rounded team. The less well-rounded team is the slower team. The faster team will not win by 2 seconds, the slower team will lose by 2 seconds."
"To determine the likelihood of each scenario, we need to calculate the probabilities.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 or 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of the first roll by the probability of the second roll: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, let's convert these probabilities to percentages: 
- The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 or 50%.
- The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in percentage, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters, then subtract that from the total straw distributed to find the amount given to the rabbits, and finally use the remaining information to solve for the number of rats.

We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 1 hamster, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

We also know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

The total straw distributed is 160, so the total straw given to the rats is 160 - 50 (hamsters) - 20 (rabbits) = 90.

Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can set up the equation 3x * 6 = 90, where x is the number of rats in each cage.

Solving for x, we get 3x = 90 / 6, which simplifies to 3x = 15.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 5.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net gain in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

In 10 years, the total number of trees he plants is 10 * 10 = 100 trees, and the total number of trees he chops down is 2 * 10 = 20 trees. The net gain in trees in 10 years is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

So, in one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
In three weeks, he rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the last three weeks to get the total kilometers.
Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. If each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since one dozen is equal to 12, twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the total cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 cups = $145 per cup.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'.

We know that the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write an equation:

w = r + 2

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, we can set up another equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' from the first equation into the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. 

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the total time spent walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 (total by the third day) - 250 (total on the first two days) = 250

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons for each pool.

Now, the amount of water in the small pool is 'x - 16', and the amount of water in the big pool is '2x - 16'. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x', we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16
= 8

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The total amount is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional amount (10% of $2000): $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We are given that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x.

"To find the total amount spent by the chef, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. The total number of girls is also 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both days.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the animals he killed on both days:
Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
Total animals: 25 + 48 = 73

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.
21 * 4 = 84

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we need to first determine the number of cows in each stall after the purchase.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls (not 10, as the question implies 20 stalls after mentioning ""each of the twenty stalls""). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2.

Now, the number of cows in each stall is 20 + 2 = 22.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%) and subtract the result from the total weight.

Weight eaten by termites = 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Weight of the tree after termites ate 30% = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to determine the number of apples and bananas each person has. 

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have: 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees and then the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 
So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 minutes (warming the oil) + 43 minutes (cooking the chicken) = 91 minutes.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Stitches for body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Total stitches for the sleeves: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then calculate how many are left after the adults have taken their share.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars taken by the adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars taken by the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the number of chocolate bars left by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working on the task. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes (break) = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval to find her total earnings.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to determine the points each player has after the third round. 

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's determine the extra points each player gets in the fourth round. 
Since Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, he gets 1 extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he gets 0 extra points.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points each player has after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (by the oldest) + 4 (by the youngest) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed by his sons. 

15 (total oranges) - 12 (oranges washed) = 3 oranges left unwashed.

On the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of all the activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of rice and then divide the total weight of the bag by the daily consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus paid per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000

Total bonus paid per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 and 32 (back and front)
- Page 2 and 31 (back and front)
- Page 3 and 30 (back and front)
- ...
- Page 16 and 17 (back and front)

This pattern continues until all 32 pages are paired. Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper used by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired perfectly without any leftover pages. In this case, since 32 is an even number, there are no leftover pages. But we also need to consider that the first and last page are on the outside when folded, and the middle pages (16 and 17) are also on the outside when folded. This means we need one more piece of paper for the middle pages.

Number of pieces of paper = 16 + 1 (for the middle pages, but in this case, it is not needed as 16 and 17 are paired on the same sheet)
= 16 

However, the first and last page are on the outside when folded, and the middle pages (16 and 17) are also on the outside when folded, but in this case, it is 16 pages on one side and 16 pages on the other side, so we need one more piece of paper for the other side.

Number of pieces of paper = 16 + 1

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books and that Elise started with 250 books. Therefore, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year, she sold 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books in the second year.

Finally, since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.
3. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves of bread for the rest of the day.
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.
5. Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved
Amount available for gifts = $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as follows:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = x (poles) / 45 (wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3 * x

Since Jam has 3 boxes, we divide the number of pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold. 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we need to find out how many of the remaining employees are programmers. Assuming the remaining employees are a mix of senior programmers and non-programmers, we cannot directly calculate the number of senior programmers. 

However, if we assume that the remaining employees (60) are a mix of senior programmers and non-programmers, and we are only concerned with the programmers, we will consider the scenario where all 60 are senior programmers for the maximum possible amount of money the company pays to all the programmers.

Number of senior programmers = 60 (for the maximum possible amount)

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. 

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to fully charge as follows:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes: $30,000/year * 20% = $6,000/year
Net income: $30,000/year - $6,000/year = $24,000/year

Job B:
Gross income: $42,000/year
Property tax: $6,000/year
Net income before income tax: $42,000/year - $6,000/year = $36,000/year
Income tax: $36,000/year * 10% = $3,600/year
Net income: $36,000/year - $3,600/year = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to calculate the difference between the two jobs:

"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names - 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider 'RJ' as an alias for 'Richard' and use the value of 5 guns for Richard.

So, the total number of guns is: 
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) = 23 guns

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

23 guns / 4 people = 5.75 guns per person

Since you can't divide a gun, we can round down to 5 guns per person with 3 guns left over. However, the question asks for the number of guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, so we'll provide the exact result of the division.

The final answer is: 5.75"

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group can be represented as 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To find the total number of legs, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.

Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:

"To find the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he runs after taking his coach's advice. 

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, we calculate the additional distance as 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance to get the new daily distance.
New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to get the total distance covered in June.
Total distance = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1,000/day

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, resulting in daily earnings of:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1,100/day

The difference in daily earnings is:

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
Value of functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning equipment = $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children.

A dozen bread rolls is equal to 12 rolls. Mrs. Sherman fed 6 rolls to her children, so the number of rolls left is:

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 rolls

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples she picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is:
2 * 12 = 24 apples

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of socks in the pairs and add the loose socks. 

Since each pair has 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks will be 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 
Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that needed washing to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed. 
50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks.

"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.1, Time = 5/12 years (since it's for 5 months).

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount to be paid ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is 130 (Axel) + 220 (Anna) = 350 pesos.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue and divide by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade.

Millie buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find her total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land, which is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it due to the bus breakdown. So, the number of female members who can perform is 26 * 0.5 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, adding to the total number of performers. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we multiply the value of one part (15) by the respective parts in the ratio to find the number of popsicles each has. 
Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves, we first need to determine the total cost of his new streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The 20% discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of his new streaming services from the cost of his old cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, so she spent 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording.

She spent 90 minutes editing.

The total time she spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. 

Initially, Erica had 20 (cards she made) + 30 (cards her dad brought) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, Erica has 50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards passed out) = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 (cards she had) + 17 (cards received) = 38 cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and Jenny's portion.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

In total, Bill and Mark have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is 7 (Bill and Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

The total number of slices left is 12 (initial slices) - 9 (slices eaten or given away) = 3.

Mark currently has $50 in his bank account, and the bike costs $300. Therefore, the amount he still needs to save is:

$300 (bike cost) - $50 (current savings) = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find the number of days he needs to save:

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by 4.

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Total pounds of meat = Number of sandwiches * Weight of meat per sandwich
Total pounds of meat = 5 * 1
Total pounds of meat = 5 pounds

Total pounds of cheese = Number of sandwiches * Weight of cheese per sandwich
Total pounds of cheese = 5 * 1
Total pounds of cheese = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the total pounds of each ingredient by their respective costs.

Total cost of meat = Total pounds of meat * Cost per pound of meat
Total cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total pounds of cheese * Cost per pound of cheese

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 140.

The total hours worked by all employees in May is 160 hours/employee * 40 employees = 6400 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in May is 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees remaining is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total hours worked by each employee in June is still 160 hours. The total hours worked by all employees in June is 160 hours/employee * 30 employees = 4800 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to first find the number of candles that are defective in both ways.

1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode (since 99% are guaranteed not to explode). 
So, the number of candles that will explode is 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. However, this 5% is a subset of the total candles, not the exploding candles. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 5% of the exploding candles.

Since 5% of the total candles smell like wet dog, and 1% of the total candles explode, we can assume that the 5% is a subset of the total candles, and the 1% is a subset of the total candles. However, we cannot directly calculate 5% of the exploding candles. Instead, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog and then find the percentage of those candles that explode.

The number of candles that smell like wet dog is 5% of 50000, which is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Now, we need to find the percentage of these 2500 candles that will explode. Since 1% of the total candles explode, and the candles that smell like wet dog are a random subset of the total candles, we can assume that 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will also explode.

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Let's denote the number of apples she gathers from the average trees as x.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the first equation as:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the second equation as:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now that we have the value of 'c', we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information provided.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this distance is for 2 days, we don't need to calculate the daily distance.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the total distance traveled:
800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (next day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion to find Zack's locker size.

Let's denote Zack's locker size as Z. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z

To find Z, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up another proportion:

20 = (1/2)T

where T is Timothy's locker size. To find T, we can multiply both sides by 2:

T = 20 * 2
T = 40

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the distance it fell (4,000 feet) from Stanley's original elevation (10,000 feet). 

Elevation of Stanley's comb = Stanley's elevation - Distance comb fell
Elevation of Stanley's comb = 10,000 - 4,000
Elevation of Stanley's comb = 6,000 feet

Now, to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation (3,000 feet) from the elevation of Stanley's comb (6,000 feet).

Distance Oliver must climb = Elevation of Stanley's comb - Oliver's elevation
Distance Oliver must climb = 6,000 - 3,000
Distance Oliver must climb = 3,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount of money he received from the two banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12,000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12,000 + $5000 = $17,000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats departed is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months (introductory) - 8 months (normal rate) = 10 months at $14 per month.
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to get the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans and the amount saved from each pair of jeans.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, we can calculate the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is actually the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the original price of the jogger jeans, which is $8, but since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost, the answer is actually the negative of that, but since the question is asking for a numerical value, we will just provide the absolute value of the difference.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade feeders) + 60 (store-bought feeders) = 150

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of each item to find the total cost: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total collection. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we first need to find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The set of pot and pans costs $120.00, the set of mixing bowls costs $20.00, and the 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00. 

Now, we add the costs of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money George spent on chips and then find out how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = $1.20

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. To find out how much he spent, we need to calculate 1% of $5 and subtract it from $5:
1% of $5 = 0.01 * $5 = $0.05
$5 - $0.05 = $4.95

Now, we know that George spent $4.95 in total and $1.20 on chips. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars George bought:
$3.75 / 0.75 = 5

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, they ate 2 pieces.

The weight of each piece is the total weight of the cake divided by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, the total weight of the cake they ate is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)

2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we calculate James' swim time as follows:
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride, so:
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We can now calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
James' run time = 180 - 121

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour x 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 0.5 bails/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 0.5 bails/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 x $5

"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy eats 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the number of apples they eat per day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. 

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is 160 x $12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Then, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. These 25 fairies joined the initial 50 fairies, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. 
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100
= 0.35 * 100
= 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the capacity of the farm truck:
Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the farm truck
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from recycling cans and bottles in a week, and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from recycling cans in a week.

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from recycling bottles in a week.

In total, Grayson earns 6 + 15 = 21 cents from recycling in a week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Grayson earns 21 * 4 = 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to determine the total number of cards she has and then subtract the 50 cards she kept for herself.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Since she kept 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gave to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

If each student received 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students (300) by the number of cards each student received (10).

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes contains 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he already had and the new shoes he got:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total:

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to calculate the total pencils at the beginning of the year, the pencils used after two months, and the pencils left at the end of the year.

Initially, there were 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total pencils at the beginning of the year were 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the pencils used were 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.

The remaining pencils after two months were 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the pencils left were 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room, the total number of cookies he can have is (x/2) + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2 or B = 2D.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

The total number of insects found is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting B = 2D and L = D + 7 into the equation, we get (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43.

Combine like terms: 4D + 7 = 43.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find twice the width of the rug, which is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other two packs of gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For 2 x 4 wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8 wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we will use that. 

Now, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24.
$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, we multiply the number of sticks per piece by 4.
400 sticks * 4 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog will need 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 dogs * 2 pairs per dog = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought individually. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4 to find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

For onions: 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions
For potatoes: 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

Now, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding the number of onions and potatoes she bought.

Total = 3 onions + 1 potato = 4

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day.
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days, respectively. 
July has 31 days, but we only need to count up to July 19th, so we'll subtract 12 days from July's total.

Total days = 1 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) = 201 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we'll divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories/day

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:

"To find the cost of the house, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

3x = 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The final answer is: 90,000"
"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to first determine her total cost and total revenue.

Total cost: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Total revenue: Tara sold the 40 bags at $8 each. The total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $320 - $160 = $160.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then determine the amount he gave to his sister, and finally calculate the amount he spent on dinner.

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. 
So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. 
Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off get on the bus.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 55 years.

Since we know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years, we can calculate Jame's cousin's current age by subtracting 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to calculate his total savings for the month and then break it down into the first and second halves.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. The daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

The total savings for the first half of the month is 15x, and the total savings for the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation 45x = 1125.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half, he saves '2x' dollars per day in the second half. Therefore, he needs to save 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half of the month.

20 tasks * $0.8/task = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, and she finished 20 tasks, so her total earnings are:
20 tasks * $0.5/task = $10

The difference in their earnings is:
$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:

4x = 4(20) = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the round trip distance to work and multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

The distance to work is 3 miles, so the round trip distance is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles per day.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process.

The alphabet consists of 26 letters. 

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 * 2 = 52 letters
2. She writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Total letters written so far: 52 + 13 = 65 letters
4. She re-writes everything she has already written: 65 * 2 = 130 letters

However, this calculation includes the original 65 letters. To find the total number of letters written, we need to subtract the original 65 letters from the total, then add the original 65 letters back in.

Total letters written = 65 (original) + 65 (re-written) = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of toys Jonathan needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James has 80 toys, five times that amount is 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

However, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this amount. So, if we let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can set up the equation x + 2 = 400.

Solving for x, we get x = 400 - 2 = 398.

The final answer is: 398"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the total cost before the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30 and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To find the total cost of the items Carly ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of the potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from $50.
$50 - $33 = $17.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two categories: sales up to $1000 and sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission:
$1000 x 0.30 = $300

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 x 0.10 = $150

To find the total amount earned, we add the commissions from both categories:
$300 + $150 = $450

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants to have for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 * 24 = 48.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the question is actually asking about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water, as there is no information provided about hot water.

To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile in cold water by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile in warm water by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, so its cost is 3 * $40 = $120.

The total cost of lunch at Subway is $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160.

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

"To determine the number of cups by which Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the daily recommended amount of coffee and Octavia's intake. 

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, let's denote the daily recommended amount as 'x'. Therefore, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan's current intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

However, we are also told that the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current intake: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the three friends: 
Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends: 
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.

The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. To find the total angle moved by the sun, we multiply the rate of movement by the time:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun moves upward from the pyramid, we add the angle moved by the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid:

32 degrees (initial angle) + 50 degrees (angle moved) = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total amount James spends on candles, we need to calculate the total number of candles required and then find the cost.

The ages of James' sons are 12 and 4 years younger, which is 12 - 4 = 8 years. 

Since we don't know the exact number of candles James wants to buy for each son, we will assume he buys candles equal to their age. So, the total number of candles required is 12 + 8 = 20.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find the cost of 20 candles, we need to divide 20 by 5 to get the number of packs required, which is 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. 

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1.5 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per

"To find the nephew's current age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then find the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 51 = 3x

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
x = 51 / 3
x = 17

This 'x' represents the nephew's age in 7 years. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from 'x': 
Nephew's current age = 17 - 7
Nephew's current age = 10

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of the previous three teeth, which was $1.00 per tooth. Half of $1.00 is $0.50, so for the last two teeth, Sharon received 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, in addition to Richie's 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate Mark's goals as follows:
Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate Anna's goals as follows:
Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual scores:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he can spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent 4 x $10 = $40. The number of wooden action figures he bought is $40 / $5 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend the remaining money on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The remaining money is $70 - $40 = $30. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $30 / $2 = 15.

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- First flower shop: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week
Total roses ordered per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses ordered per week by 4:
Total roses ordered per month: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
Ford grows 40 roses/week, so in a month, he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
Roses lacked per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = cost of bread + cost of cheeses and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

First, we need to find out the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Kate can make 24 crayon muffins. Since she can sell each muffin for $1.50, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the total square footage of the bedroom and then multiply it by the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total square footage is:
18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:
216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2,592

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:
216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is:
216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is:
216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7,344

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation:

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we can apply the same percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

Actual temperature = Desired temperature / (1 + Percentage/100)
= 520 / (1 + 4/100)
= 520 / 1.04
= 500

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven at 500 degrees for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils by adding the cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:
Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the two boxes after the discount. 

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of one box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and will last Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned during her workout.

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
R + B + G = 4500

We also know that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:
R = 0.99B

We also know that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:
G = 1.01B

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1515

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since 90 degrees is the largest angle, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Distance = 2000 miles
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production rate:

(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours):

Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount he had.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours separately, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were 15 * $0.50 = $7.50. Since he worked for four hours, his total earnings for the first four hours were 4 * $7.50 = $30.

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were 10 * $0.60 = $6. Since he worked for two hours, his total earnings for the next two hours were 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours to find the total earnings: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

First, we need to calculate the number of rotations per month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can calculate the total number of rotations per month as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles per month = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the number of rotations per month (145,000) to get the total number of months the tire can last:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

Finally, we can divide the total number of months by 12 to get the total number of years:

72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

"To find the cost per pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps will give 120 washings. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 2 * 120 = 240 pumps.

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. The cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

The total price after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Joe has $50 to spend, so to find out how much money he will have left, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week and then multiply that by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of dozens of croissants he plans to make in a week is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, multiply the total number of dozens by the amount of butter per dozen:
28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 

The cost per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

The cost per month for the additional months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The total cost for the additional months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves Jim with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to find the number of men.

First, we calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we calculate the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Now, we are given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. Therefore, the price of the silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can calculate the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

So, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount in one bag by 3.
Total flour in three bags = 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them covered and then add those distances together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For Alisa: Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles
For Stanley: Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Total miles biked = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total Time = 10 hours

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after three weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, we add the initial likes to this number: 140000 + 2000 = 142000.

Finally, we add the 20000 new likes: 142000 + 20000 = 162000.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount would be 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price paid by Sheila was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from green hats would be 2 * $400 = $800.

The total sales in the first month would be the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months would be the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour. 

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the previous hour. Therefore, the cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of each paid hour: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount she actually received.

Sally's expected wage is $300. Her bank account initially had $200, and it now holds $420. Since she received no other money, the difference in her bank account balance is the amount she received as her wage.

The amount she received as her wage is $420 (current balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220.

Now, we subtract the amount she received ($220) from her expected wage ($300) to find the amount withheld:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (actual wage) = $80

"To determine the number of eggs Lori will need, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. 

Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves required is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of eggs required is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since eggs are usually sold in dozens, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens required is 24 / 12 = 2.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to complete the book and then subtract that from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment.

The total number of pages in the book is 200 pages. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. 

To find the total number of days it will take Mike to complete the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 
200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days.

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to complete the book from the total number of days he has:
30 days - 20 days = 10 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000

Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000
Total monthly expenses: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total expenses for the first year would be:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the total expenses for the first year, we get:

"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 50 + 30 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as:
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by isolating 'g' in the second equation:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 is 0.20 x $5 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants to buy a week's worth of coffee, he needs to buy 7 pounds of coffee.
The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. We know the cost of the vaccines is $40, so we can set up the equation:

0.4x = $40

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is $100 * 0.6 = $60.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

$125 - $100 = $25

"To determine the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, which is $0.5. Therefore, the price of one banana is $0.5 * 2 = $1.

The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, which is $1. Therefore, the price of one orange is $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total price of the crate of fruit is the sum of the costs of each type of fruit: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Total chairs currently available = 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs required. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Total chairs required = 42 (regular chairs for adults) + 15 (high chairs for babies) = 57.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs. She also needs 42 regular chairs, but she already has 40, so she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we first need to determine the total points collected by the students. 

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

50% of $2400.00 = 0.5 * $2400.00 = $1200.00

She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment:
20% of $2400.00 = 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00

Total amount set aside for retirement and car payment: 
$1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00

First, let's calculate the total number of city fireworks: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300: 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill their seat. Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. The total number of drinks and snacks per person is 2 (drinks) + 3 (snacks) = 5 items.

Since there are 20 people, the total number of items (drinks and snacks) is 20 (people) * 5 (items per person) = 100 items.

Each item (drinks and snacks) costs $2. To find the total amount spent, we multiply the total number of items by the cost per item: 100 (items) * $2 (cost per item) = $200.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck and then subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

The total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

Since each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find out how much they raise per hour. 

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find the hourly amount, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The remaining amount is the goal minus the amount already raised: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount: $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we add the hours they have already worked to the hours they still need to work: 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, and then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%: 
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then multiply it by the total number of hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so its production rate for chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the factory can make 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so its production rate for vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the factory can make 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

The total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking and compare it to the cost of buying at the store.

The cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is the cost per pound of $2.5 multiplied by the number of pounds.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate her father's age as follows:
Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add the weights of all her books. 

She has math and science books weighing 2 pounds each, so the total weight of these two books is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books: 
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Total number of voters = 100.

Votes received by candidate C = Total number of voters - Total votes received by candidates A and B
= 100 - 50

"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris initially, we need to subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

Cost of gallon jar - $2 = Cost of half-gallon jar
$5 - $2 = $3

So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

10-gallon jars: 10 * $5 = $50
16 half-gallon jars: 16 * $3 = $48
Total amount spent: $50 + $48 = $98

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. 

Given that 5 students like to play basketball, and the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as follows:
Number of students who like to play music = 2 * Number of students who like to play basketball
Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5
Number of students who like to play music = 10

Now, we know that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. The total number of students who have been accounted for is:
10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25

Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:
Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - Number of students who have been accounted for
Number of students who like to play video games = 50 - 25
Number of students who like to play video games = 25

Next, we need to find the number of girls in each class. We are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

40 students * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Finally, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

"To determine Mark's profit, we need to calculate his total revenue from selling the cards and subtract his total cost.

Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so his total cost is:
3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is:
$4000 + $1000 = $5000

He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
30 cards * $50/card = $1500

The total revenue from selling the cards is the sum of the values of all the cards:
$5000 + $1500 = $6500

"To calculate the weekly savings, we need to first determine the daily savings. 

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. The original cost per tomato was $0.5, and the new cost per tomato is $0.4. 

Daily savings per tomato = Original cost - New cost
Daily savings per tomato = $0.5 - $0.4
Daily savings per tomato = $0.1

Total daily savings = Daily savings per tomato * Number of tomatoes sold per day
Total daily savings = $0.1 * 500
Total daily savings = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to get the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Total daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = $50 * 7
Weekly savings = $350

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we first need to determine the number of marbles each of them has.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. We can calculate Carl's marbles by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56

"To determine the number of groups needed, we first need to find the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of students per group by the number of groups: 9 students/group * 12 groups = 108 students.

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we divide 54 by the number of students per group (9): 54 / 9 = 6 groups.

Since the activity requires 12 groups, but only 6 groups can be formed with the given number of students, we need to find the number of additional groups required. However, the question seems to be asking for the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups with the given number of students, which is not possible.

If we consider the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups in total (not with the given number of students), we can calculate the number of groups that can be formed with the given number of students and then find the difference.

6 groups can be formed with the given number of students. To form 12 groups, we need 12 - 6 = 6 more groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils.

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils.

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony had 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, let's add the total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Finally, let's subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each category of movies separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in each category:
- Total movies: 600
- Movies in series: 600 / 3 = 200 movies
- Remaining movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies
- Older movies: 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies
- Normal movies (not in series and not older): 400 - 160 = 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the cost of each category:
- Movies in series: 200 movies * $6 = $1200
- Older movies: 160 movies * $5 = $800
- Normal movies: 240 movies * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the costs of each category:

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30z
Points from time for Ava: 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between Ava's total points and Emma's total points:
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = -25

The final answer is: -25"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost $30 from the total cost of all four pizzas. 

The total cost of the two pizzas is $30. Since there are two pizzas that cost the same, we can denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. 

The total cost of all four pizzas is $64. We can set up the equation as follows: 
2x + 30 = 64

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 64 - 30
2x = 34

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:
x = 34 / 2
x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the information provided.

They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual times, so they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For 2 days, that's 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

The total number of rides in a week is 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + y) orange fish and (4 + x) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + y = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:

y = 5 + 2x

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

x + (5 + 2x) = 17

Combine like terms:

3x + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of fuel consumed.

Since Andy only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the total distance traveled per day is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles (to and from work).

The total distance traveled per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of fuel consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since Carrie spent all 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, and she had 10 twenties. 3/5 of 10 is:
(3/5) * 10 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees. To find the difference between the desired temperature and the current temperature, we subtract the current temperature from the desired temperature.

Temperature difference = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heat per log

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups and then the number of members who brought seashells.

Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10 groups

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups with seashells = Total number of groups * (3/5)
= 10 * (3/5)
= 6 groups

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members who brought seashells is:

Number of members with seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54 members

Given that each member brought 2 seashells, the total number of seashells is:

Total seashells = Number of members with seashells * Number of seashells per member

For the additional 3 hours, Jamie earns a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular rate. To calculate this rate, we multiply her regular rate by 1.5:
$20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour

Her pay for the additional 3 hours is:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find Jamie's total pay for the day, we add her pay for the regular hours and the additional hours:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

The percentage of stuffed goats will be (x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30%

To solve for 'x', we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

Now, we can cross-multiply: 
x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides: 
0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7:

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth graders', it is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals from the flowers that were dropped.

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals initially: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals initially: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores by 2 (since there are two kids). 

14 / 2 = 7

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person used and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'f', the amount of salt as 's', the amount of sugar as 'g', and the amount of oil as 'o'. 

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have z = f.

Given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have s = g.

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have o = 2s.

Given that she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have s = 2z.

Now, we can express all the variables in terms of 'z'. 
Since s = 2z, we have o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z.
Also, since z = f and s = g, we have f = z and g = s = 2z.

Now, we can express the total amount of the mixture in terms of 'z'. 
Total = o + s + g + f + z = 4z + 2z + 2z + z + z = 10z.

Given that the total amount is 10 ounces, we have 10z = 10.
So, z = 1.

Now, we can find the amount of oil used. 
o = 4z = 4(1) = 4.

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially had: Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially had 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold: Joe sold 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother: Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gave away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left: Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, the number of cars Joe has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. So, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars were added to the parking lot. So, the total number of cars before lunch is 50 + 20 = 70.

It is given that 1/2 of the cars in the parking lot had gone during lunch. Therefore, the number of cars that remained is 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 35.

"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to determine his daily earnings first. 

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the earnings per cycle are 5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are 30 cycles * $6 per cycle = $180 per day.

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week, which is 7. 

Weekly earnings = $180 per day * 7 days per week = $1260 per week.

"To find the number of cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:
Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost based on weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original purchase price is $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount, so the refund is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- The original purchase price is $32.

Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

Time taken by one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if the turtles are traveling at half the speed, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance.

Time taken by one turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours per turtle.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by four turtles will be the same as the time taken by one turtle.

Time taken by four turtles = 12 hours.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we need to first determine the total number of pairs James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs is:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

We know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built. This means they will build the same amount as the first two years combined, not double the total amount including the third year. So, in the third year, they will build 48 homes.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the brother's age as B, the sister's age as S, and the speaker's age as A. We also denote the mom's age as M.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = B - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)
4. A + B + S + M = 87 (When you add all our ages, you get 87)

We can express S in terms of A from equation 2: S = A - 2.

We can express M in terms of B from equation 3: M = 3B - 1.

We can express B in terms of A from equation 1: B = A + 3.

Now, substitute B in terms of A into the expression for M: M = 3(A + 3) - 1 = 3A + 8.

Now, substitute the expressions for B, S, and M into equation 4:

A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3A + 8) = 87

Combine like terms:

6A + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

6A = 78

Divide both sides by 6:

A = 13

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack to find the number of packs needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to consider the initial amount, the amount after the first increase, and the amount after the second increase.

The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add this increase to the amount after the first increase: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river at that point: 14000"
"To determine the total number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, resulting in 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected. Each of them infects 6 others, resulting in 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected. Each of them infects 6 others, resulting in 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previous) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80
Total tips for Julieta: $800 - $80 = $720

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year: 36 (Wendy) - 6 (Amber) = 30.

"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the number of slices sold and multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to determine the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins.

We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. However, we are also given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To find the number of silver coins, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver and gold coins:

Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold)
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. 

Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: 
S = A + 25

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: 
A = F - 12

We are also given that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation: 
A + S + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F. 

First, substitute S = A + 25 into the third equation: 
A + (A + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms: 
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation: 
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

Expand the equation: 
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

Combine like terms: 
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: 
F = 28

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find the cost of one carrot, we first need to determine the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. Therefore, Kamala paid her 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. Therefore, Alba paid her 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns. 
Total mowing earnings = Joe's payment + Kamala's payment + Alba's payment
Total mowing earnings = $6 + $18 + $30
Total mowing earnings = $54

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her total mowing earnings from her total earnings.

Total lemonade earnings = Total earnings - Total mowing earnings
Total lemonade earnings = $80 - $54
Total lemonade earnings = $26

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. 

He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours his car is rented out per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly income from renting out his car is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income to calculate his profit. 

His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Distance rowed by Dijana = 50 miles
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + 10
Distance rowed by Anis = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by adding the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:

Total distance = Distance rowed by Dijana + Distance rowed by Anis
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total pages from Denise's total pages:
28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the total number of bowls the family will eat for dinner and subtract that from the total capacity of the pot.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 2 adults and 2 children will be eating dinner, we can calculate the total number of bowls as follows:

- 2 adults = 2 adult bowls
- 2 children = 2 child bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls are equivalent to 3 adult bowls (2 adult bowls + 1 adult bowl equivalent to 2 child bowls), the family will eat 3 adult bowls worth of soup for dinner.

Now, let's calculate the leftover soup:
- Total capacity of the pot = 4 adult bowls
- Soup eaten for dinner = 3 adult bowls
- Leftover soup = 4 - 3 = 1 adult bowl

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the leftover soup can fill 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 1 time.

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, we multiply the number of sets by the material required per set: 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the material needed for 2 sets of 3 and the remaining 2 masks separately). For 2 sets of 3 masks, we multiply the number of sets by the material required per set: 2 * 2.25 = 4.5 yards. For the remaining 2 masks, we need to calculate the material required for 1 set of 3 and then divide it by 3 and multiply by 2: (2.25 / 3) * 2 = 1.5 yards. Now, we add the material required for 2 sets of 3 masks and the remaining 2 masks: 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material required for the small masks and the large masks: 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he had 30 marbles, 1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6 marbles.

He also gave 10 marbles to Donald.

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, let's subtract the number of marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

The number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

We also know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. 

Duncan's age eight years ago was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

Adam's age four years ago was A - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

30 = A

So Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can add the sizes of both farms to find the total number of acres:

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons. Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express P in terms of J:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute P and L in the first equation using the expressions we found:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in 30 days:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, we can calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in 30 days:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000:
$259200 - $194400 = $64800

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option:
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To determine the amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate the amount for each sheep as follows:

Amount for each sheep = (2 * amount for each goat) - 3
Amount for each sheep = (2 * 5) - 3
Amount for each sheep = 10 - 3
Amount for each sheep = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total amount for goats = number of goats * amount for each goat
Total amount for goats = 15 * 5
Total amount for goats = 75 pounds

Total amount for sheep = number of sheep * amount for each sheep
Total amount for sheep = 12 * 7
Total amount for sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = Total amount for goats + Total amount for sheep
Total amount of hay needed = 75 + 84
Total amount of hay needed = 159 pounds

"To determine how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gave away from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total amount Patty charged, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, we add up the three components to get the total amount charged:
$40 (visit charge) + $105 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $205

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 
Since James got them for 40% off, he paid 60% of the original price. 
60% of $150 is 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation A + B + D = 45 as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15, which is 60.

Now, we multiply the number of 15-minute intervals (60) by the number of reports stapled per interval (30). 

60 * 30 = 1800

The total number of reports stapled is 1800."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she spent sleeping and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so the actual time she slept is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also spent 23 minutes sleepwalking (from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.). Subtracting this from the total time, we get 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first determine the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the final number of unoccupied beds.

At the end of the second day, the pirates dug 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

At the end of the third day, before filling in the holes, the pirates dug 23 + 8 = 31 holes. After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W, respectively.

We know that A + S + W = 339 (the total number of Pokémon caught).

We also know that A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan).

Additionally, we know that S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught).

We can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into the first equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Combine like terms:

2S + W + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2S + W = 334

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation into this equation:

2(4W - 13) + W = 334

Expand and simplify:

8W - 26 + W = 334

Combine like terms:

9W - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:

9W = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now that we know W, we can find S:

S = 4W - 13
= 4(40) - 13
= 160 - 13
= 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north in this segment, the distance traveled is subtracted from the total distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can find the net distance by adding the distances traveled in the first and third segments and subtracting the distance traveled in the second segment:
Net Distance = Distance (first segment) + Distance (third segment) - Distance (second segment)
Net Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces per day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract that from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car: $100
Discount on the red car: 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their individual prices:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60
Total cost = $160

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that at that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be 48. Since this is 5 years from now, we can calculate his dad's current age by subtracting 5 from 48. So, D = 48 - 5 = 43.

When Emil turns 24, he will also be twice as old as his brother. This means that at that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his brother's age will be 12. Since this is 5 years from now, we can calculate his brother's current age by subtracting 5 from 12. So, B = 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now by adding D and B.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught and then divide it by the amount in one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24 students.

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which includes football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members
= 6 + 6
= 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers she needs to fill her flower bed. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants to find the total number of plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will round down to 44 plants because Pat already owns 17 flowers.

Now, we subtract the number of flowers Pat already owns from the total number of flowers she needs: 44 - 17 = 27.

Finally, we multiply the number of flowers Pat needs to buy by the cost of each flower to find the total amount she will spend at the store: 27 * 6 = 162.

"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias: Katherine has 5 baskets, and each basket will have 3 petunias. So, the total number of petunias is 5 x 3 = 15. The cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines: Katherine has 5 baskets, and each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines. So, the total number of sweet potato vines is 5 x 2 = 10. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / Soil per rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her total annual income, the amount she sets aside for shoes each year, and then divide that by the cost of each pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00, so her annual income is:
$2,000.00/month * 12 months/year = $24,000.00/year

She sets aside 25% of her income for shoes, which is:
$24,000.00/year * 0.25 = $6,000.00/year

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00/year / $1,000.00/pair = 6

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté the shrimp, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, then multiply that by the time it takes her to sauté one group.

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per group = 3 groups
3 groups * 10 minutes per group = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté the shrimp.

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes

"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time period.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This results in a total warming of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the total cooling effect minus the total warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backward.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The total remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

Walter's friend donates $200, so the new total is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else has donated $2200, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by 15. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. To do this, we'll divide the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100.

Percentage of the watermelon each adult gets = (2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before this 3-hour period:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.785
Charge before 3 hours = 35.66%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up an equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.66% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.66% / 0.624
Initial charge = 57.2%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 57%.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase three times.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price after 1 year = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price after 2 years = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18
Total number of portraits and selfies = 45

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

After the afternoon check-ins, the total number of guests is 76 + 30 = 106.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find the total points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, we find the number of easy questions: 40% of 60 is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we find the number of average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions. 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions correct and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, we add up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the price of small and large stuffed animals and use the given information to find the number of small stuffed animals sold.

Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as 'S' and the price of a large stuffed animal as 'L'. We know that L = 3S.

Given that the price of a small stuffed animal (S) is $4, we can calculate the price of a large stuffed animal (L) as:
L = 3S
L = 3 * $4
L = $12

Now, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'y'. We know that x = 2y (twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales of small and large stuffed animals is $120. We can set up the equation:
4x + 12y = 120

Since x = 2y, we can substitute x in the equation:
4(2y) + 12y = 120
8y + 12y = 120
20y = 120

Now, we can solve for y:
y = 120 / 20
y = 6

Since x = 2y, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
x = 2 * 6
x = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, we need to find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
8 sandwiches * $1.5 per sandwich = $12.

Initial cost of the new bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining balance per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he won't have to turn in his homework and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect homework is 50% (or 0.5).
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of all the scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 0.76

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 1:
1 - 0.76 = 0.24

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.24 * 100 = 24%

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles.

Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of each fabric piece is calculated by multiplying the length and width:

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we will only consider the losses on the first and third races. Total amount lost = $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

However, to find the average loss, we need to consider the net loss, which includes the win on the second race. Net loss = Total amount lost - Amount won = $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we multiply the total hours worked per day by the total number of days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set) is 6, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Total number of tiles = Total area / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To find the amount James pays per month, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

Normal cost: $120
60% of normal cost: 0.6 * $120 = $72

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch per weekend and then multiply it by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

Since they watch 4 movies every Saturday, and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

The total number of movies they watch per weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

There are 4 weeks, and each week has one weekend. Therefore, the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had initially, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers. 
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 100 (initial) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats consume per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that daily amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food each cat consumes per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed by all cats per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 / 360 = 2.

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can calculate Jake's slices by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. 
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding Becky's, Jake's, and Silvia's slices.
Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x' minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18' minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts is equal to 98 minutes.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x represents Donovan's part, Betsy's part is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The cost of the cast is $200.
The doctor's time is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Since the doctor charges $300/hour, the cost for 30 minutes is $300 / 2 = $150.
The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
The cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas left, we need to find 30% of 20 (since 100% - 70% = 30%). 
30% of 20 is 0.3 * 20 = 6.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, so they ate 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas. The number of pizzas left is 40 - 32 = 8.

Now, we add the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team: 6 + 8 = 14.

Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we can calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = Number of trucks dispatched - Number of trucks that failed

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests will be 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there is an additional charge of $6 for each guest beyond 20. Since there are 41 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The additional cost for the 21 guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the additional cost: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten per day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 individual roses for $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

The change owed to Jenny is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to determine the total number of days he works.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works:
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:
6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to first calculate the daily time spent on lunches and breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total daily time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Adding the lunch break, the total daily time spent is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total daily time spent on lunches and breaks is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discounts:
- Frying pan: 20% off $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00 discount. So, the cost of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
- Set of towels: 10% off $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00 discount. So, the cost of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total amount spent on the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Now, we add this amount to the balance after the return:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

New balance: $113.00"
"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, and that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * large jellyfish = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3 to isolate the number of large jellyfish, we get:

large jellyfish = 6 * 3
large jellyfish = 18

We also know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. We can set up the equation:

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

Multiplying both sides by 5 to isolate the total number of jellyfish, we get:

total jellyfish = 18 * 5
total jellyfish = 90

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can calculate Caroline's age since Caroline is three times older than Ben:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she would need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she wants to retire in 20 years, and she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then she would have saved 20,000x dollars so far.

The amount she needs to save in the next 20 years is 800,000 - 20,000x dollars.

The amount she will save in the next 20 years is 20,000 * 20 = 400,000 dollars.

Equating the two amounts, we get 800,000 - 20,000x = 400,000.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

This means she has been working for 20 years already.

So she needs to work for 20 more years.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts.

Then, we divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students based on the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population are boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total students = 240 boys

We can express 40% as a decimal by dividing by 100: 0.4. Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

Number of girls = total students - number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has to complete her journey. Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we can assume June has 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. If she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily total is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she would cover in 30 days at her current rate: 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since Soledad's goal is 9,300 miles, we subtract the total miles she would cover at her current rate from her goal: 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

However, since she walks twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles per day by 2: 60 miles / 2 = 30 miles.

So, Soledad must hike 30 more miles per session to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will give to Peter and Paul. 

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount given away is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the question asks about James, but the initial buyers were Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, we can assume James is one of them, likely Jacques. 

The total amount initially bought was 12 kg, and 7 kg were given away. So, James (or Jacques) will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

After buying the two books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. This means that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the two books by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

The two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining 400 - 200 - 20 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

"To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we need to first determine the number of eggs each person painted.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs.

Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18

Divide by 2: x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs (since Camden and Sarah painted 30).

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

Using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:
Time = 40 minutes, Distance = 2 miles
Speed (x) = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk:
Speed on the sidewalk = 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
Time = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
Total Time = 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of heat transfer and the final temperature of the mixture. When Donny pours water from the two mugs into his water bottle, the resulting temperature will be a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.

Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x. We know that the first mug is 33 degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug. The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water, the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x) = 5 oz * 40°F

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Since x represents the temperature of the second mug, we can conclude that the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 
With a 10% discount, the total cost will be $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets per year and then multiply it by the number of years in a decade.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree per year, the total number of lemons he gets per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree/year = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade. So, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by the total parts in the ratio (14) to find the value of one part. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

Initial number of women = 6 * 9 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:
84 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, let's add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:
39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate his total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Now, let's calculate Adam's loss:

Total Cost - Total Revenue = Loss
$100 - $84 = $16

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. In this case, the total number of days is the sum of the days required for each type of scene, but since she can't work on all of them simultaneously, we have to consider the days required for each type of scene separately and then add any additional days required to complete the remaining scenes.

However, a more efficient approach would be to calculate the total number of days by considering the most time-consuming scenes first. In this case, the large-sized scenes require the most days (9 days). During these 9 days, Lauren can also work on the medium-sized scenes. 

In 9 days, she can draw 9 * 6 = 54 medium-sized scenes, but she only needs 36. So, she can complete the medium-sized scenes in less than 9 days. 

Now, let's calculate the remaining days required to complete the small-sized scenes after 9 days. In 9 days, she can draw 9 * 7 = 63 small-sized scenes, but she needs 49. So, she can complete the small-sized scenes in less than 9 days as well.

However, this approach doesn't give us the exact number of days required to complete all the scenes. A more accurate approach would be to calculate the total number of days required to complete the large-sized scenes and then add any additional days required to complete the remaining scenes.

Since Lauren can complete the medium-sized and small-sized scenes in less than 9 days, we can assume that she will complete the large-sized scenes in 9 days and then work on the remaining scenes.

The remaining medium-sized scenes are 36 - (9 * 0) = 36 - 0 = 36 - 6 * 6 = 0 (since she can complete 6 medium-sized scenes per day in 6 days).
The remaining small-sized scenes are 49 - (9 * 0) = 49 - 0 = 49 - 7 * 7 = 0 (since she can complete 7 small-sized scenes per day in 7 days).

However, this approach is still not accurate. A more accurate approach would be to calculate the total number of days required to complete all the scenes by considering the most time-consuming scenes first and then adding any additional days required to complete the remaining scenes.

Let's recalculate the total number of days required to complete all the scenes.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, the additional number of bottles they need to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. 
To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received in the week.

Total reports received in the week = 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received in the week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.

2. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his original land (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land: 
   - He sold 40 square meters in the first sale.
   - He sold 20 square meters in the second sale.
   - Total land sold so far: 40 + 20 = 60 square meters.
   - Remaining land: 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

   He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add the amount earned from each sale:
$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"To find Geb's age, we need to first determine half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13. 

Now, we are given that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3.

Geb's age is 3."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Since we want to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to first determine the total number of eggs hidden and then subtract the number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply that by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, the total payment per week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the production for each year:
- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0
- Year 10: 1000

Total production = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

Given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Length of blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of money Rissa and Ronnie had initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, who was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

1/5 of $15 is $15 * 1/5 = $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister.

Ronnie initially had $5. After giving $3 to their sister, he is left with $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is comprised of the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). 

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, so the yellow portion is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. The remaining portion (red, white, and purple) is also 6 pints.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining portion (6 pints) by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 / 3 = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we can calculate the total area of the house by adding the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box and the cost per pod.

The regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods, which is 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120 pods.

Since the new box costs the same as the regular box ($12), the cost per pod in the new box is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Now, to find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: $1200 / $5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the daily usage.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be 2 inches or less, given that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.

First, let's find out how much chalk the teacher uses each day in inches. 
20% of 5 inches is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

However, since the chalk is already 2.75 inches, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk for each day.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to determine the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then find the amount he is eligible for a refund.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is calculated as follows:
Total gallons of milk = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = Total gallons of milk * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to calculate the amount of milk that is eligible for a refund:
Amount of milk eligible for refund = 2/5 * Total gallons of milk
Amount of milk eligible for refund = 2/5 * 4000
Amount of milk eligible for refund = 1600 gallons

Now, we can calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = Amount of milk eligible for refund * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5
Refund amount = $5600

"To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write the equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write the equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find the number of books he can buy per dollar, we divide 100 by 500.

100 books / 500 dollars = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we multiply the number of books per dollar by the total amount Bob has to spend.

0.2 books per dollar * 27000 dollars = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To determine the number of apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. He threw this 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has the apples in his pocket (5) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11 apples.
4. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the number of 50 kg bags of coal he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per unit.

First, we divide the total amount of coal ordered (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg):

850 kg / 50 kg = 17

So Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. 

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per unit ($18):

17 bags * $18/bag = $306

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of cheese slices required is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Each friend also eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni slices required is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas required is 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is a total of 3 days. 
3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, which is a total of 2 days. 
5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles run on the 3-mile days and the 5-mile days.
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per hour, we need to multiply the melting rate per 15 minutes by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour). So, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Now, we can calculate Jay's net snowball production rate per hour by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour.

To find the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by his net production rate (12 snowballs/hour): 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and the anniversary marks 20 years since the show came out, we can calculate John's age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

It is given that John was twice as old as Jim at that time. So, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age at that time:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
= 4 + 20
= 24

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means that before the third day's order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages. So, before the first day's order, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left from the second day, and 31 + 38 = 69 bandages used and left from the first day.

Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she is eligible for the additional $10 for complete attendance. However, the problem states she receives this amount, but it does not specify if it is per week or per month. Assuming it is per week, she would receive 4 * $10 = $40. But if it is per month, she would receive $10. 

Assuming it is per month, her total earnings would be $270 + $10 = $280.

Assuming it is per week, her total earnings would be $270 + $40 = $310.

However, since the problem does not specify, I will provide the answer for both scenarios.

Assuming per month:

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately. 

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles. The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we calculate 50% of the cost of scotch and add it to the cost of scotch: $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

Now, we find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of scotch and cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there were 4 people in total. 

To find out how much root beer was available for each person, we divide the remaining amount of root beer (8 gallons) by the total number of people (4).

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The equation can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to find the value of 'x':

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

Total number of fish = 66
Number of fish with red stripes = 66 * (1/3) = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes.

Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * Remaining fish
= 5/11 * 44
= 20

Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she initially had and subtract the colors she lost and used.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which is 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors. So, the total number of colors she initially had is 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy lost 4 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used from the total number of colors she initially had: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, this 240 inches includes the height of the second floor's ceiling. Since the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling. But the height of the second floor's ceiling is not given. Assuming the height of the second floor's ceiling is the same as the first floor's ceiling (thrice as high as Mattison), we subtract 180 inches from 240 inches. However, this is not the case as the second floor's ceiling is the roof, and the height of the roof is not the same as the first floor's ceiling. 

The height of the second floor's ceiling is not given, but we can infer that the height of the second floor is the same as the first floor, which is 180 inches. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the second floor's ceiling minus the height of the second floor's floor, but the height of the second floor's ceiling is the same as the height of the roof. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. 

The height of the second floor is the same as the first floor, which is 180 inches. The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 420 - 180 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles would be 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles the first three dogs need to walk: 
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Total miles for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need from the total miles all the dogs need: 
12 - 8 = 4 miles.

Then, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he had leftover:

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

The total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

Combined capacity = Total capacity of Ali's school + Total capacity of John's school

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The principal amount is $300, and the interest is 2% of $300. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Total amount owed = Principal amount + Interest = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the total amount paid in 11 months from the total amount owed.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying the base area by the height: 
Volume = base area * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches 

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is: 
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8 
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches 

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar: 
Total jelly beans = Effective volume / volume of a jelly bean 
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 
Total jelly beans = 2880 

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is: 
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 864 

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, subtract the estimated number from the true number: 
Difference = True number - Estimated number 
Difference = 900 - 864

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

In the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 5 * 3 * 2 = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next 3 years, Pauline continued to visit the museum 3 times a year, and the new cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 3 * 3 * 5 = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total pounds of meat = Total number of meatballs / Number of meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:
c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of:
5 dozens x 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the price per egg is $1/3.
The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:
60 eggs x $1/3 per egg = 60/3 = $20

Now, let's calculate Rose's profit:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $20 - $12
= $8

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the bag. 

Original price of the bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price of the bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the discounted price to cents. 
$15.00 = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110, which is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

On the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 
So, 77 - 42 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So we can write this as:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of blueberry cubes: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to first find out the total number of games she has played. 

Since Ara has been playing 40 games every year for four years, the total number of games she has played is 40 * 4 = 160 games.

Now, we know that her score for every game is 21 points. To find the total number of points she has scored, we multiply the total number of games by her score per game.

Total points = Total games * Score per game
Total points = 160 * 21
Total points = 3360

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to break down the information provided.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms. 

Total flashlights = (1 flashlight/person * 4 people) + (2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms)
Total flashlights = 4 + 16
Total flashlights = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4.

Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms
Total small candles = 16

Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms
Total medium candles = 20

Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
Total candles = 16 + 20
Total candles = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles and flashlights.

Total candles and flashlights = Total candles + Total flashlights
Total candles and flashlights = 36 + 20
Total candles and flashlights = 56

"To find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Since the sixth side is already solved once the fifth side is done, we don't need to add any extra time.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to determine the number of robots and footballs in addition to the given number of helmets.

Given that there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:
Number of footballs = 2 * Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Given that there are half as many robots as helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work and then divide that by the time it takes him to deal with a call.

First, let's convert the hours Tim spends at work each day into minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends at work in a week is:
360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the time it takes him to deal with a call (15 minutes):
1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time taken to cover the distance on land + Time taken to cover the distance in water
Total time taken to return home = 5 minutes + 10 minutes

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

"To determine the number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total number of gallons of lemonade Tim will make. He originally planned to make 4 gallons, but his friend asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.

So, the total number of gallons of lemonade is 4 (regular) + 1 (twice as tart) = 5 gallons.

However, the twice-as-tart gallon will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice required is 4 (regular) + 2 (twice as tart) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed is 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

"To find the total age of the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother and then add up the ages of all the siblings.

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we have the ages of all the siblings: 
- 3 sisters, each 16 years old: 3 * 16 = 48 years
- 1 brother, 12 years old
- 1 brother, 24 years old

Total age of all the siblings = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years.

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break it down into meditation and yoga time separately.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. In 4 weeks (28 days), she meditates for 30 * 28 = 840 minutes.

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 60 * 5 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

The final answer is: 34"

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen seeds would be 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18 seeds. Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, to find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"To find the number of pens Sarah has, we first need to determine the number of pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find the number of pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake will pay full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt ($8 * 0.5 = $4). The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to get the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes Igor gathered. 

Since Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

We know that Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which is 7. However, he lost some of them on the way to the lab bench.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as x. Then, the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is 7 - x.

We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29

Combine like terms:

8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29
31 - x = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:

-x = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 2

"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, and he needs 32 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if we denote Vanessa's speed as 'v', then Aaron's speed would be '2v'. 

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we know Aaron's distance (2 miles) and his time (16 minutes). We can use this information to find Aaron's speed. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes
Speed = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Aaron's speed is '2v', we can set up the equation:
2v = 1/8 miles per minute
v = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by dividing the second equation by 2 to simplify it:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
